			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Trade Minister Hiroshi  Kumagai on Friday [8 April] cautioned against the recent moves  by public entities to raise rates on utilities, transportation  and other fees.    Recent plans to raise public fees should not be easily  justified at a time when many countries are calling on Japan to  rectify its heavy price gaps with other countries, International  Trade and Industry Minister Kumagai told a regular press  conference.    The warning came after the government earlier in the day  unveiled basic guidelines for increasing public fees.    The guidelines, prepared in response to a barrage of public  criticism of public rate hike plans, address the importance of  local governments and concerned entities taking full  consideration for the impact such hikes may have on overall  prices and people's livelihood.    Kumagai said further deregulation and administrative reform  intended to remove structural problems needs to be implemented  to push down Japanese prices to international levels.    Rate increases now under consideration include medical  expenses, highway tolls, tuition at national universities, taxi  charges, gas and electricity rates, municipal buses and subways,  rents for publicly owned houses and telephone rates.    In line with the latest guidelines, the government is  expected to postpone or scrap part of these plans.    Kumagai indicated his support for the introduction of a  product liability law when he referred to a court ruling on a  defective TV.    The March 29 ruling by Osaka District Court said the maker,  Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., should be held responsible  for a defect that caused a fire unless it could prove there were  no mechanical problems with the TV.    The ruling was epoch-making because the court accepted that  consumers seeking compensation simply need to prove that a  product was defective, instead of having to prove negligence by  the maker, as at present.    A government panel recently proposed excluding such a  provision from any product liability law passed in Japan.    The ruling "showed that the current surrounding product  liability is moving in a certain direction," Kumagai said.    Matsushita said Thursday it will not appeal the ruling.</p>

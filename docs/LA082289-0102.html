			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BLAZE KILLS MAN IN BOARDED-UP HOUSE  </P> <P> One man died of smoke inhalation and another was in intensive care Monday after  a fire in the boarded-up house in Eagle Rock where they were sleeping, Los  Angeles police said.  </P> <P> "It appears that they might have set fire to one end of the house to keep warm  and slept on the other side," said Detective John Munguia.  </P> <P> The fire started on a porch on the opposite side. Because the windows were  boarded, the smoke had no where to escape, he said.  </P> <P> Firefighters were called to the house on Eagle Rock Boulevard about 5 a.m. but  did not discover the men until several hours later, Munguia said. The two  unidentified victims, between 25 and 30 years old, apparently were transients,  he said.  </P> <P> The survivor was in the intensive care unit at Glendale Memorial Hospital.  </P></p>

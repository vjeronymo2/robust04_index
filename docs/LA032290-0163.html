			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTERN UNION SAYS IT MAY FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION  </P> <P> Western Union said Wednesday that it may default on interest payments due June  15 and that it might seek protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy  law.  </P> <P> In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Western Union said it  must work out a favorable restructuring of its debts and raise funds by selling  property or making a new public offering.  </P> <P> But the company added that it has exhausted available bank credit and already  has put up much of its remaining assets to secure loans and meet pension-plan  obligations.  </P> <P> On the other hand, Western Union said, the sale of its microwave network should  be completed this year, and it is continuing to consolidate operations and trim  costs -- moves that it said should pay off eventually if it can overcome its  cash deficiency.  </P> <P> The filing is the latest installment in a seven-year history of hard times that  have plagued the company formed by investors 139 years ago to string telegraph  lines across the United States.  </P></p>

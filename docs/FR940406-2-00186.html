			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Related EISs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Savannah River Waste Management EIS, also announced in this issue of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , will address treatment, storage, and disposal alternatives for a variety of wastes, whereas the Defense Waste Processing Facility Supplemental EIS will evaluate the cumulative impacts of specific modifications to the Defense Waste Processing Facility system. The Waste Management EIS will include waste facilities associated with Defense Waste Processing Facility, such as the treatment of waste water discharges in the F- and H-Area Effluent Treatment Facility, F- and H-Area Tank Farm, and the construction and operation of a high-level radioactive waste evaporator in the H-Area Tank Farm. The Waste Management EIS also will evaluate alternatives to the Consolidated Incineration Facility technology for mixed waste (includes radioactive constituents in addition to hazardous constituents such as benzene). The documents will be prepared in close coordination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOE proposes to perform the Defense Waste Processing Facility review in a supplement to the 1982 EIS for the Defense Waste Processing Facility. Although the analysis could be included in the Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS, DOE believes public review and DOE's decision making process would be facilitated by preparing a separate document, because the Defense Waste Processing Facility is a very specialized operation with limited connections to the activities to be covered in the Waste Management EIS. Where there are interconnections, duplicate discussions within both documents may be required or the documents will cross reference one another.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Activities at the Defense Waste Processing Facility have proceeded on the basis of the 1982 EIS and Record of Decision. Construction of the Defense Waste Processing Facility is almost complete, testing of the system with chemicals has begun, and processing runs of simulated (non-radioactive) material will begin in the next few months. DOE committed in an agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency and the State of South Carolina to adhere to a schedule that provides for testing with radionuclides to begin in December, 1995. In order to support that schedule and to manage efficiently the high level radioactive waste contained in the tank farms, in-tank precipitation must begin in late 1994 or early 1995. A supplemental EIS focussing on the changes to the Defense Waste Processing Facility can be completed in time to meet this schedule, while the Waste Management EIS is expected to take several more months to prepare. Delay of start-up for the Defense Waste Processing Facility would cost approximately $21,000,000 per month.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Supplemental EIS will examine all reasonably foreseeable impacts of operating the Defense Waste Processing Facility, including alternative methods of managing the waste streams from the facility. DOE believes that this will provide sufficient information to decide whether to proceed with operation of the facility in advance of completion of the Waste Management EIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Preliminary Description of Defense Waste Processing Facility Supplemental EIS Alternatives <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The Proposed Action Alternative <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since completion of the 1982 EIS and as a result of the Defense Waste Processing Facility modifications, new information about the Defense Waste Processing Facility process has become available to which the public has not yet had full access. The proposed action of this Supplemental EIS is to continue construction and begin operation of Defense Waste Processing Facility as currently designed. DOE would continue the Defense Waste Processing Facility process and facility modifications that are currently underway, would complete startup testing activities, and would operate the facility upon completion of startup testing. Analysis of the proposed action will allow DOE to determine whether the decisions reached as a result of the 1982 EIS remain valid in light of process and facility modifications over the last 12 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (2) The Alternative Actions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DOE will examine whether there are other reasonable system alternatives for the Defense Waste Processing Facility (in the context of its current state of construction) such as mitigation measures, pollution prevention efforts, and facility design or process modifications that could reduce the risk of operation. Conclusions reached in the 1982 EIS concerning alternatives to constructing and operating the Defense Waste Processing Facility will also be reviewed to assess whether technology developments have occurred that might influence those decisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (3) The ``No Action'' Alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DOE will analyze a no-action alternative under which current waste generation and waste management practices would continue. That is, high-level liquid radioactive waste would remain in the tanks. Although the no-action alternative may not be a reasonable alternative in all respects, its analysis will establish a baseline for comparison of the environmental impacts of the proposed action and its alternatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Identification of Environmental Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Supplemental EIS will analyze the following environmental issues applicable to the operation of the Defense Waste Processing Facility, consistent with discussion above in the Background section. Modifications to this list might occur as a result of the scoping process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Public and worker safety and health risk assessment: radiological and nonradiological impacts of the proposed action and alternatives, including projected effects on workers and the public from construction, normal operation, and potential accidents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.

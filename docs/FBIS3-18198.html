			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ankara--Turkey's outlawed Workers Party of Kurdistan  (PKK) is organizing a three-day "Kurdish conference" in Moscow  starting today, reliable sources told the TDN [TURKISH DAILY  NEWS] on Monday [21 February]. The meeting is seen as the first  step towards enhancing relations and understanding between the  organization and Russian officials. The conference comes after  an influential Russian newspaper reported last Friday that  Moscow might establish relations with the PKK in retaliation for  "Ankara's use of the Chechen card" against Russia.    The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA said in its report that such an  initiative on Moscow's part was natural, and argued that it was  illogical that their relations with Kurds were so limited. The  paper also said there were representatives of the PKK both in  Russia and in Armenia, and that they had established contact  with officials there.    Moscow-based sources said on Monday that the conference,  called "History of Kurdistan," was organized by the Kurdistan  Committee-Moscow, one of the PKK's committee offices that are  widespread throughout the region.    The main participant at the conference is the PKK's  so-called  Kurdistan National Liberation Front (ERNK), although "other  Kurdish parties" have also been invited to attend.    According to TDN sources, the Russian Ministry of National  Affairs is actively involved in organizing the meeting, in which  the "current developments in Turkey" will be the main topic  discussed.    The nationalist Kurdish movement in general, a review of the  Kurdish movement in Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey, as well as  terrorism, were cited among the issues to be discussed. Sources  close to the PKK had said earlier this year that the PKK had  rented several apartment blocks in Moscow and was aiming at  improving its relations with Russia.    In recent weeks, messages have been sent from the ERNK to  Russian officials requesting for the establishment of relations  and cooperation.    Although Russia's policy related to Turkish Kurds has not  been voiced openly, Western diplomatic sources say that Moscow  seems to want to see Ankara sitting at the table and negotiating  with the PKK.    On March 1, Bilgin Unan, deputy undersecretary at the  Turkish  Foreign Ministry, will be visiting Moscow as part of routine  political consultations between the two countries. A statement  released by the ministry said on Monday that Unan would visit  Russia as guest of First Deputy Russian Foreign Minister  Anatoliy Adamishin. Bilateral relations and regional and  international problems are to be on the agenda of talks.</p>

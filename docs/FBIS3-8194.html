			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The Republican Council of the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] held a session in Trnava. Its  members discussed preparations for early parliamentary and local  elections and elected new officials of the Movement's council.  The final briefing was attended by newly elected Chairman Arpad  Matejka and HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar. Peter Toman,  representing our Radiozurnal, interviewed them.    [Begin recording] [Toman] Mr. Chairman, what in your view  are  the most important conclusions reached at today's session of the  Council?    [Meciar] In substance, a decision was made to form working  groups to work on the final draft of the Movement's  program--that is, our election program--which we expect to turn  subsequently into our government program.    The other important thing was the election of the bodies of  the Council: new Chairman Arpad Matejka and new Deputy Chairman  Zlocha. Mr. Mihalik continues to be the secretary. They were  elected by secret ballot in several rounds.    The third thing I consider important is that the strategy of  two options has been more or less drafted: either to go three  times to election ballot boxes--i.e., a referendum and major  elections and small elections [not further explained]--or just  to have the two elections. These issues were drafted and agreed  upon, and I think that everybody is [word indistinct] going to  work on them.    [Toman] Did you discuss preparations for local elections,  too?    [Meciar] Yes, the selection of candidates and coalition  strategy is a matter for local bodies. [passage omitted] [end  recording]</p>

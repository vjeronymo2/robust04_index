			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIBERAL PARTY PULLS OUT OF E. GERMAN COALITION;  </P> <P> REUNIFICATION: A LARGER GROUP THREATENS TO DO THE SAME. AT ISSUE IS THE TIMING  OF JOINT NATIONAL ELECTIONS.  </P> <P> East Germany's first democratic government teetered on the brink of collapse  Tuesday, but the quicksilver pace of German unification showed no sign of  slowing despite the bitter political infighting.  </P> <P> The quarrel over the precise timing of the historic merger reached a crisis  point after the small Liberal Party faction walked out of Prime Minister Lothar  de Maiziere's grand coalition, and the country's second-largest party, the  Social Democrats, threatened to follow suit.  </P> <P> At issue is whether East Germany should accede to West Germany on the eve of  joint national elections scheduled for Dec. 2, or immediately afterward -- a  technicality that could determine the political tilt of a united German  Parliament.  </P> <P> But even as the East Berlin coalition showed signs of unraveling barely 100  days into De Maiziere's office, discussions between the two Germanys over key  points of their merger rolled along.  </P> <P> West German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told reporters in Bonn that  final negotiations on a treaty that would outline a single legal and political  system for united Germany should be complete by the end of August.  </P> <P> Schaeuble said experts from both sides were making "good headway" in laying the  ground for an Aug. 1 meeting of German unity committees from the East and West  German parliaments.  </P> <P> Speaking on condition of anonymity, an East German government spokesman said  Tuesday night that there is no chance "at all" that the political storm in East  Berlin might slow the reunification process, because all parties are committed  to the goal.  </P> <P> The two German states have already merged their economic, social and monetary  systems. After the second treaty uniting political and legal systems is ironed  out, joint elections are all that is needed to seal the merger.  </P> <P> Choosing a capital remains one of the biggest stumbling blocks in the  political-legal treaty, according to Schaeuble. East Germany has declared a  preference for Berlin, but critics argue that the city's Third Reich World War  II history plus the staggering cost of uprooting the West German federal  government make staying in Bonn a more practical choice.  </P> <P> A weary-looking De Maiziere told reporters late Tuesday that the strife in East  Berlin amounts to nothing more than "tactical election maneuvering" by his  worried rivals. But he nonetheless scheduled emergency talks with vacationing  West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl for Thursday.  </P> <P> Both men are Christian Democrats, and Kohl is considered the front-runner to  become the first leader of a united Germany after 45 years of bitter division.  </P> <P> Although the Liberal resignation still left De Maiziere with a clear governing  majority in the 400-seat Volkskammer, loss of the Social Democrats' 88 seats  would leave him two votes short of a mandate.  </P> <P> De Maiziere, a concert violist and human rights lawyer holding his first public  office, could then either attempt to form a new government or try to govern  with a minority.  </P> <P> The Liberals issued a statement in East Berlin sharply criticizing De  Maiziere's "unyielding stand on the issue of accession and voting procedures."  </P> <P> The Liberals and Social Democrats want East Germany to legally dissolve itself  and accede to West Germany on Dec. 1, one day before the federal elections.  Such a move would mean adhering to West German electoral laws, which require a  party to win at least 5% of the popular vote to claim seats in Parliament.  </P> <P> That 5% rule would effectively block smaller East German political parties,  including those who mounted last fall's peaceful anti-Communist revolution,  from winning seats in the all-German Parliament.  </P> <P> De Maiziere and some smaller East German parties insist that the Dec. 2  balloting be divided among East and West districts, which would permit East  Germany's estimated 12 million voters to apply their own, more liberal election  laws.  </P> <P> East Germany would then immediately accede to West Germany, effectively dodging  the 5% rule in a move that De Maiziere acknowledges favors his own Christian  Democrats.  </P> <P> He denied accusations by opponents that his stance was choreographed behind the  scenes by Kohl's own Christian Democrats to ensure that Kohl would keep his  lead in the election race.  </P> <P> "Any speculation that Bonn plays a special role is absolutely unacceptable," De  Maiziere said Tuesday night in an interview on West German television.  </P> <P> The Christian Democrats won more than 40% of the popular vote last March 18,  when 93% of eligible East Germans cast ballots in the country's first free,  democratic election.  </P> <P> Now, the smaller parties lined up with De Maiziere on this complicated yet  crucial issue ironically include the discredited Communists -- an embarrassment  De Maiziere has attempted to shrug off by asserting, "We didn't vote with them;  they voted with us."  </P> <P> The Liberals pounced on the strange conservative-Communist alliance as "a  startling pact" that "is unbearable for us."  </P> <P> But De Maiziere said Tuesday's bailout "just goes to show that you can't rely  on Liberals. They collapse when faced with a problem such as this. Well, if  it's too heavy for them, we'll just have to carry it alone.  </P></p>

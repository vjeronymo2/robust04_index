			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 36: Compiled </F> by Sergey Logachev, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] President Guntis Ulmanis received Monday a letter  from Boris Yeltsin, in which the Russian president confirms his  readiness to meet in Moscow to discuss bilateral relations. The  letter was handed over to Ulmanis by Russian Ambassador in  Latvia Aleksandr Rannikh.    A spokesman for the president's administration told Interfax  that the letter says that now there is an opportunity, through a  summit dialogue, to improve the relations between Latvia and  Russia, to strengthen relations in the political, economic and  social spheres.    In the letter Yeltsin outlines his view on the present legal  status of the Russian-speaking population in Latvia and assesses  the recent round of the Russian-Latvian negotiations that  completed in Jurmala last week.  IF Note: Guntis Ulmanis planned to visit Moscow late in 1993  and postponed the visit several times. Early this year his  visit did not take place either, though it was planned. The  president said this took place partially owing to the incident  of January 10 in Riga, when two Russian general were arrested  and there were sharp statements against the Baltic countries and  Latvia in particular from Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev and other Russian politicians.</p>

			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAEL ADMITS PATROL BOAT FIRED NEAR HUSSEIN'S YACHT;  </P> <P> MIDDLE EAST: DEFENSE MINISTRY SPOKESMAN SAYS INCIDENT WAS A 'ROUTINE WEAPONS  CHECK.' JORDAN'S MONARCH IS 'ASSURED IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.'  </P> <P> A recent weekend pleasure cruise by Jordan's King Hussein was abruptly  interrupted when an Israeli naval patrol boat fired shots nearby, Israeli  officials said Friday.  </P> <P> The king thought they were shooting at him and ordered his boat to flee into  the coastal waters of Saudi Arabia. The Israelis say they were only clearing  their guns.  </P> <P> The incident took place last Saturday in the Gulf of Aqaba at the head of the  Red Sea and was revealed six days later in the newspaper Haaretz. No one was  hurt, although the shooting may fuel already mounting ill will between Israel  and neighboring Jordan.  </P> <P> According to Haaretz, Hussein said that the Israelis pursued his vessel and  fired repeatedly at him. The royal yacht was accompanied by a Jordanian patrol  boat, but it did not fire back.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the Defense Ministry here said that no boat pursued Hussein.  </P> <P> "No shots were fired by the Israeli navy at King Hussein's yacht, and no chase  was conducted," the spokesman said. He termed the firing a "routine weapons  check."  </P> <P> He added that "Israel naval units have longstanding and clear orders regarding  rules of conduct during the passage of King Hussein's yacht, and in the  incident noted, the Israel naval vessel acted in accordance with these  instructions.  </P> <P> "We assured Jordan it won't happen again," the spokesman concluded.  </P> <P> Immediately after the incident, Jordanian officials asked the United States,  which is friendly to both governments, to intervene with Israel. William Brown,  the U.S. ambassador to Israel, met with ranking Israeli officials Tuesday to  express King Hussein's "outrage" and the Bush Administration's "concern" about  the potential implications, sources said.  </P> <P> During the meeting, the sources said, the Israelis promised to issue strict  instructions to Israeli sea patrols to ensure that no further incidents take  place. U.S. envoys then relayed the assurances back to the palace in Amman, the  Jordanian capital.  </P> <P> On the basis of the meetings, a State Department spokesman said Friday that the  United States "felt comfortable" with Israeli assertions that the incident was  "inadvertent."  </P> <P> Sources for Haaretz, a liberal daily, asserted that the firing was no accident.  </P> <P> "Nobody could have had any doubt that the king was on the boat," the paper  quoted a source as saying. "He was standing on the deck, and it was possible to  identify him easily."  </P> <P> Privately, a U.S. official in Washington said the Israeli explanation was  "highly unusual." Administration sources believe, however, that the Israeli  government "did not purposely open up on the king of Jordan."  </P> <P> U.S. officials said that the Israeli response has not fully satisfied Hussein.  </P> <P> In recent months, tensions have been mounting between Israel and Jordan over  repeated attempts by renegade Jordanian soldiers to cross into Israel and  attack border settlements. There have also been incidents of rockets fired into  Israel from Jordanian territory by Palestinians who infiltrated from Syria.  </P> <P> Rightist Israeli politicians have asserted that Hussein's rule over Jordan is  illegitimate and that Palestinians who make up the bulk of the population there  should wrest control of Jordan from him. These rightist Israelis assert that  this would get rid of the Palestinian demand for an independent state in the  West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel occupies.  </P> <P> Hussein, alarmed by such talk, has stepped up contact with Iraq, which has the  Middle East's most powerful army and has voiced threats to use chemical weapons  on Israel.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Robin Wright, in Washington, contributed to this story.  </P></p>

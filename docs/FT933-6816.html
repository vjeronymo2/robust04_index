			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / International Company News: Way clear for US utility merger THE DECISION by Ipalco Enterprises, parent of Indianapolis Power &amp; Light, to end its bitter five-month, Dollars 1.73bn takeover bid for PSI Resources has cleared the way for PSI's friendly merger with Cincinnati Gas &amp; Electric. Mr John Hodowal, Ipalco chairman and chief executive, surprised PSI's annual meeting on Monday by announcing that the company was dropping its Dollars 30.50 tender offer for PSI shares. This was because Ipalco had failed to gain sufficient proxies to elect five candidates to PSI's 14-member board. The fight for PSI, which supplies electricity to 600,000 customers in the counties surrounding Indianapolis, is another ripple in a wave of consolidation that analysts expect to sweep the US utility industry in the coming years. Until recently, hostile takeovers have been rare. However, with utilities facing growing competition in the wake of federal deregulation, many are seeking to trim their costs through economies of scale. 'I wouldn't be surprised to see 25 per cent of the industry involved in consolidation over the next five years,' said Mr Daniel Scotto, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities in New York. 'Already, in the past three or four years, the industry has seen more consolidation than it had over the previous 50 years.' PSI has estimated that it would save about Dollars 1bn in fuel, maintenance and other costs over the next 10 years through a merger with CG&amp;E. The two utilities are proposing to form a new company, called CINergy, with shareholders of each swapping their shares for shares in the group. The value of the deal is linked to the value of shares in the Ohio-based utility. The PSI-CG&amp;E link is still contingent on regulatory approval. Indiana utility regulators are expected to focus on the threat of predatory pricing, which could endanger Ipalco, a utility that serves an area encircled by that served by PSI. Ipalco's proposed takeover of PSI was largely a defensive action to prevent its neighbouring rival from gaining a competitive edge. State approval of the merger was not a foregone conclusion, said Mr Scotto. He said regulators would examine how the deal would affect the state as a whole. PSI would have to demonstrate clearly that the proposed merger would indeed result in savings to ratepayers throughout the region. Regulatory approval was the issue that appeared to turn the tide in the PSI proxy fight away from the Ipalco proposal.</p>

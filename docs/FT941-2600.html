			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Hoare Govett sterling bonds - At a glance Hoare Govett is planning an issue of sterling bonds, with additional income generated by Waldner Financial Corporation, a Chicago based money manager which boasts annual returns of 47.6 per cent over the last 10 years. Eighty per cent of the money invested is used to buy triple-A rated sterling bonds for collateral, while the remaining 20 per cent is managed by Waldner, which has a technical 'quantitative' management approach. According to Hoare Govett, the worst case is that the investor gets half the interest normally paid on a triple-A rated sterling bond, but based on past performance returns would be close to 20 per cent.</p>

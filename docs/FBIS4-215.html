			<p>BFN     [Text] A snap poll by Markinor for the SABC indicates that  right-wing groups boycotting elections in South Africa enjoy  little support. At the same time the majority of whites are  scared for their future under an ANC government. This survey  was carried out among 500 white South Africans countrywide.  According to the Electoral Act this opinion poll is one of the  last of its kind that can be released. After tomorrow the act  bans the publication of opinion polls indicating support for  parties, their leaders, or their policies. Ronel van Zyl  analyzes this opinion poll.    [Begin recording] [Van Zyl] The developments in  Bophuthatswana last month that led to the deposing of former  President Lucas Mangope contributed to the discrediting of  right-wing groups. The deployment of Afrikaner National Front  and AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] armed forces in  Bophuthatswana was rejected by 82 percent of whites.    [AWB leader Eugene Terreblanche] A magnificent victory for  the AWB.    [Van Zyl] This remark by AWB leader Eugene Terreblanche was  condemned by 83 percent of whites. Concerning participation in  the election, 80 percent of whites believe that all right-wing  organizations should participate. This includes 68 percent of  right-wing supporters. Eight-four percent of all whites say  that General Constand Viljoen of the Freedom Front has made the  right decision by participating in the election. The idea of a  homeland is opposed by 60 percent of all whites and 54 percent  of Afrikaans-speaking whites. The idea enjoys the support of 30  percent of whites, while only 13 percent are prepared to live in  such a homeland.    Sixty-three percent of whites feel they will be worse off  under an ANC government, but 90 percent say they will accept an  ANC government if they are allowed to continue their lives  unhindered. The opinion poll indicates that the state president  and National Party leader, Mr. F.W. de Klerk, is the most  popular leader among whites. [video indicates 72-percent  support] He is followed by DP [Democratic Party] leader Dr. Zach  de Beer [42 percent], whose support has risen sharply over the  past few months, followed by Gen. Viljoen, CP [Conservative  Party] leader [37 percent], Dr. Ferdie Hartzenberg [17 percent],  and then Mr. Terreblanche [12 percent]. According to the poll,  64 percent of Afrikaans speakers say that the AWB is an  embarrassment to other Afrikaans speakers. There is a 5 percent  margin of error. [end recording]</p>

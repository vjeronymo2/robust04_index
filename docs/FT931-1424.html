			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / International Company News: BCI tumbles 16.9% to L264bn BANCA COMMERCIALE Italiana, the state-controlled Italian bank which is to be privatised, suffered its second consecutive year of sharply-falling net profits with a 16.9 per cent drop to L263.8bn (Dollars 167m) in 1992. The reduction in earnings at parent bank level followed a 33 per cent slump in 1991, However, the dividend again remains unchanged at L200 for ordinary shares and L230 for savings stock. BCI attributed its lower earnings to higher taxes and depreciation, write-offs on securities and heavier provisioning for loan losses. Similar factors are likely to push down earnings at most Italian banks this year. Earnings at operating level showed an opposite tendency, with a 21.2 per cent jump in gross profits to L1,380bn, due partly to careful cost control matched by a slight decrease in staff numbers. Continuing heavy investments in new branches, which increased the network by 60 units to 706 at the end of last year, contributed to a 10.9 per cent rise in deposits to L92,736bn. Loans rose by 13.3 per cent to L85,339bn. At group level, total assets last year went up to L131,000bn from L117,053bn in 1991. Monte Dei Paschi di Siena, the Italian bank, is set to take majority control of Sindibank, the small Spanish financial institution in which it bought a minority holding in 1990. Sindibank, controlled by the Fierro group, has 40 branches and is currently stock market-listed. Monte dei Paschi plans to raise its stake to 57 per cent from the current 33 per cent via a capital increase now under way. That will be followed by a public tender offer for the remaining shares left floating, after which Sindibank will be delisted.</p>

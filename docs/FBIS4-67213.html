			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "AIDS Patient Smuggles 1.5 Kg Heroin </F> From Thailand"]    [Text] For the narcotics police at Vienna's Schwechat  Airport, Madal Beltran (42), a Spanish citizen who arrived in  Vienna from Bangkok, gave the "clear" impression of being a  "drug addict." When police experts searched him, they found  heroin worth 1.5 million schilling hidden in a camera case.  Moreover, they found statuettes that are probably also made of  the same drug.    In the interrogation, the Spaniard admitted to being HIV  positive and said that he had taken over the drugs from his  fellow traveler Juan Ripoli Tocho (43), also a Spanish citizen.  Both men have been arrested.</p>

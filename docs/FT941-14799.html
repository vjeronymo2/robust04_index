			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / South Korean groups target core businesses South Korea's 30 largest conglomerates, or chaebol, yesterday completed the selection of their main business sectors as part of a government policy to reduce the size of the sprawling business groups. The core industries selected will receive funding benefits under the country's tightly-regulated financial system. They include relaxation of credit controls, and priority government approval for issuing bonds abroad and raising capital on the domestic stock market. The government will also provide research and development support to high-tech companies and ease restrictions on land purchases. It is the latest of several so far unsuccessful government attempts to persuade the chaebol to streamline their operations and specialise in a few industries. Officials have long argued that the chaebol have diversified into too many unrelated industries, which is harming their efficiency and global competitiveness. They have for example, spent capital on expanding their industrial empires in intense competition with one another rather than on developing products through higher research spending. The expansion of the chaebol was fed by cheap government loans as the country rapidly industrialised in the past three decades, although the state has tried to reduce financing in recent years. The 10 largest chaebol, including Hyundai, Samsung, Lucky-Goldstar and Daewoo, were asked by the government to select three core industrial sectors and the next 20 were ordered to pick two sectors to develop. Non-core industrial sectors will be subject to strict credit restrictions. The plan bears some similarity to the last chaebol policy, introduced in 1991, which stipulated that the 30 leading conglomerates had to select three core industries, which would then receive unrestricted bank loans. But that programme failed to reduce the size of the chaebol or fulfil the government's hope that they would select their most advanced industries. Instead, the designated core companies were often those needing the most capital investments, such as the troubled petrochemical industry, or ones with the heaviest debts. The government this time tried to correct some of those problems by proposing that core companies must meet certain conditions to qualify. Selected companies, for example, must already account for at least 10 per cent of group sales, which would indicate that they are already competitive. But the new list of core companies still bears a strong resemblance to the ones picked three years ago. Chemical companies emerged as the largest group of core companies, with 22 being selected, including 13 in the petrochemical area. Other favoured industries included food and beverage (11), motor vehicles (9), energy (9), machinery (6), electronics (6), steel (6) and non-metal minerals (5). In the service sector, 24 companies engaged in trade, distribution and transportation industries were selected; 12 more were in construction. The government may have difficulty in preventing the business groups from using the core companies to funnel funds they obtain to non-core industries, a problem that afflicted the previous policy  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      SOUTH KOREA'S TEN TOP CHAEBOL             Core business sectors and related companies  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hyundai: Motor vehicles (Hyundai Motor, Hyundai Motor Service), electronics (Hyundai Electronics) and energy (Hyundai Oil Refinery, Seil Oil).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Samsung: Electronics (Samsung Electronics), machinery (Samsung Heavy Industries, Samsung Aerospace), chemicals (Samsung General Chemicals, Samsung Chemicals).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Lucky-Goldstar: Electronics (Goldstar, Goldstar Electron), chemicals (Lucky, Lucky Petrochemical), energy (Honam Oil Refinery, Saebang Oil).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Daewoo: Motor vehicles (Daewoo Motor), machinery (Daewoo Heavy Industries, Daewoo Shipbuilding &amp; Heavy Machinery), distribution (Daewoo Corp.)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sunkyong: Energy (Yukong, Hungkuk Sangsa, SKI), chemicals (SKC), distribution (Sunkyong, Yukong Shipping).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hanjin: Transportation (Korean Air, Hanjin Shipping), machinery (Hanjin Heavy Industries), construction (Hanil Development, Hanjin Construction).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Ssangyong: Motor vehicles (Ssangyong Motor), non-metal mining (Ssangyong Cement), energy (Ssangyong Oil Refinery, Buma Oil).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Kia: Motor vehicles (Kia Motors, Asia Motors), machinery (Kia Precision Works), steel (Kia Specialty Steel).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hanhwa: Energy (Kyungin Energy), chemicals (Hanyang Petrochemicals), distribution (Hanhwa, Hanyang Stores, Golden Bell).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Lotte: Distribution (Lotte Shopping, Lotte Development), food and beverages (Lotte Confectionery, Lotte Chilsung Beverage, Lotte Ham, Lotte Milk), chemicals (Honam Petrochemicals).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LAID-BACK SAN DIEGO NOT A CITY FOR CHAMPIONS  </P> <P> As another depressing sports year in San Diego draws to a close, the  ever-optimistic local sports fan is left to ponder the same old question: Why  do all of my teams lose? Be it the Aztecs, Padres or Chargers, San Diego sports  teams can be counted on to disappoint and dishearten even the most loyal sports  fan. Of course, the one aberration is the Sockers.  </P> <P> Well, I think I have the answer to this dilemma.  </P> <P> San Diego is, by nature, a weak, soft, laid-back, silly sort of resort city  that lacks any real intensity or grit. The teams that represent this city  manifest these qualities and play accordingly. It doesn't make any difference  how intense or tough an athlete is when he comes here (San Diego produces few  of its own athletes) after a few margaritas, some guacamole and a day at the  beach, they lose their edge.  </P> <P> The answer is not new coaches, free agents, new general managers or new arenas.  As long as the teams represent San Diego, they can be counted on to play  accordingly. This fact won't change until the demeanor of the city changes, and  that won't be happening in the near future.  </P> <P> BILL TAPP  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

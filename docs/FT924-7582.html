			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Coal county fears loss of its strongest prop: Paul Cheeseright explains why Nottinghamshire has lost its former resilience THE LATEST round of pit closures will hit Nottinghamshire harder than those of the 1980s. Then, the county's economy was more robust and there were plenty of older miners who could retire early. Now the average age of Nottinghamshire miners is only 33. Fears that colliery closures could lead to a 15 per cent shrinkage of the county's gross domestic product were aired last week in an inquiry into the future of the coalfields conducted for Nottinghamshire County Council by Mr Anthony Scrivener QC. Nottinghamshire County Council complains that 'there has been no special government assistance for the area, yet job losses equal those of three Ravenscraigs and four Consetts' - a reference to steel-industry closures which attracted government help. The decline of the coal industry in the county has coincided with a reduction of employment in engineering and traditional industries such as textiles. In early 1981 Nottinghamshire was the most prosperous county in the East Midlands, measured by gross domestic product per capita. Its GDP was 103 per cent of the UK average. By the end of the decade this had fallen to 97.5 per cent. In the region the county had been overtaken by Leicestershire and Northamptonshire. In the 1980s there was a marked increase of employment in the services sector, albeit off a low base, but the most striking characteristic in the jobs pattern of the county economy was the diminished role of coal mining. Since 1980 17 collieries have been closed with the loss of 26,000 jobs. It is not clear to what extent those who lost their jobs have been absorbed into the economy. There are no statistics to show how many miners retired, how many found other jobs or how many remained unemployed. It is clear, however, that the effect on the economy was severe. The 1989 census of employment showed that 2 per cent of the UK workforce was engaged in the water and energy industries, but in the Nottinghamshire coal area the proportion was 12 per cent and, in rural areas, where most of the coal mines were, the proportion was 34.1 per cent. Direct coal-mine employment has fallen since 1980 from more than 38,000 to fewer than 14,000. Under British Coal's initial proposals a further seven pits, employing 5,680 directly, would have been shut. This number has been reduced to two in the immediate future as a result of the announcement last week by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. They are Cotgrave, south of Nottingham, and Silverhill, in the Alfreton-Ashfield area, employing 1,340 miners. The remaining five await the outcome of Mr Heseltine's review. The future of the county coal industry is thus uncertain. The stakes are higher than simple colliery closures, however. British Coal in Nottinghamshire has been paying out more than Pounds 260m a year in wages and salaries. The county coal mines have been buying in goods and services worth more than Pounds 210m a year. The coal mines are among the biggest customers of East Midlands Electricity, spending more than Pounds 28m a year. Nottinghamshire County Council calculates that, for every two jobs which disappear from the mines, another goes outside. It fears for the future of the local coal-fired power stations. It is worried that the removal of spending power from the economy will result in the atrophy of economic activity, hitting the leisure and recreation industries first. The pains of more coal-mine closures will vary in their severity. Cotgrave and Calverton - the latter is on the review list - are on the fringe of the diversified Nottingham city economy. Here the opportunities for employment are likely to be higher than in the Alfreton-Ashfield and Mansfield areas, where the other collieries - Bilsthorpe, Clipstone, Rufford, Bevercotes and Silverhill - are situated. Male unemployment rates in Mansfield are 20 per cent and in Alfreton-Ashfield 14.5 per cent, explaining the government's decision to grant Mansfield assisted-area status. Unemployment rates are running consistently above the national average and it seems that the expansion of the services sector has not been enough to cope with the pains of a restructuring economy.</p>

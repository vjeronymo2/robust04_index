			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BETTING WITH JANICE;  </P> <P> THE REMATCH  </P> <P> Treading on SURELOCK's turf, I ended the week on a positive note when In Excess  won the eighth race on Sunday. However, I missed my $10 exacta box when Barton  Dene finished third. Today, I'm betting a $15 exacta baseball in the seventh  with Lakeland Beauty-Belara-Singing Pirate.  </P> <P> Janice Goldinger's Sun. Bankroll: $2,131  </P> <P> Sunday's Profit: $125  </P> <P> Current Bankroll: $2,256  </P> <P> SURELOCK lost $80 on Sunday when Mehmetori, who went lame, failed in the eighth  race. SURELOCK, casually reminded by his programmer of the fate that befell HAL  in "2001, a Space Odyssey," spewed dozens of bets for Wednesday. However, given  the limited budget the computer has to work with, only a few of its bets are  possible. They are: A $2 Pick Nine composed of Fistylee, Proclamation, Bold 'N  Timely, Valid Allure, Honor Clef, Casey's Plum, Cascading Gold, Sondeed and  Worthy Rolfe. Also, a $2 Pick Six composed of the above selections; $15 triples  of Casey's Plum, Danzig Melody and Got It Dialed in the sixth to Cascading Gold  in the seventh and Sondeed in the eighth; also another $15 triple on Casey's  Plum-Cascading Gold-Sondeed, and a $20 exacta box, I Can Do That-Honor Clef, in  the fifth race.  </P> <P> SURELOCK's Sun. Bankroll: $494  </P> <P> Sunday's Loss: $80  </P> <P> Current Bankroll: $414  </P> <P> Note: Janice Goldinger, a horse owner, does not bet on races her horses run in.  SURELOCK does not own horses.  </P> <P> Both players started with a $2,000 bankroll.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BIG BEN, LONDON'S HEART SKIP BEAT  </P> <P> The four clock faces on Big Ben clanked to a halt for three hours Friday, and  London's heart seemed to skip a beat.  </P> <P> The government agency that services Big Ben and other state buildings  throughout the country said the clock stopped at 11:07 a.m. and was out of  action until about 2:15 p.m.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for the Property Services Agency, speaking anonymously, said the  cogs that advance the clock's hands were unable to turn even though the  pendulum continued to swing. She could not explain what caused the malfunction.  </P> <P> Big Ben is the name of the 13 1/2-ton bell, which chimes out the hours from  behind the clock faces.  </P> <P> Stoppages are rare for the giant 131-year-old clock tower, which has survived  pollution, foul weather and war. The British Broadcasting Corp. uses the chimes  to introduce its 6 p.m. and midnight newscasts, taking the sound live by  microphone from the tower. Its other newscasts use the atomic clock at  Greenwich.  </P></p>

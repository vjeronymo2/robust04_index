			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GIANTS WILL HAVE TO WAIT; PADRES WIN, 5-3  </P> <P> The fans filtered into Candlestick Park Friday night preparing for the funeral.  This was the night, they figured, that the San Francisco Giants would bury the  Padres once and for all.  </P> <P> There even was a vase of flowers, seemingly proper for any morning, from an  anonymous donor awaiting the Padres in the clubhouse upon their arrival Friday  afternoon.  </P> <P> Just how confident were the Giants before the game?  </P> <P> "For us not to win it now," Giant outfielder Pat Sheridan said, "we'd have to  be hit by a plague. Look at us. We've got two of the best pitchers in the  league in Scotty Garrelts and Big Daddy (Rick Reuschel). No one has got two  better hitters than us with Will Clark and Kevin Mitchell.  </P> <P> "Really, there's no doubt in our mind we're going to win this thing. Our  biggest concern is if we'll win it by the end of this home stand (concluding  Sept. 24). We want to have it all wrapped up before we go on the road for those  last six games."  </P> <P> Well, it's not over yet.  </P> <P> But please, hold onto the flowers.  </P> <P> The Padres, overcoming the collapse of third baseman Bip Roberts and a ball  that bounced off the noggin of Chris James, defeated the Giants, 5-3, in front  of 33,920 well-wishers at Candlestick, keeping their faint playoff hopes alive.  </P> <P> The victory, the Padres' 18th in their past 22 games, moved them back to within  five games of the Giants with a precious 14 remaining. The Padres say they  still need to sweep this three-game series, but Act 1 is complete, leaving  today's confrontation as the latest biggest game of the season.  </P> <P> It hardly was easy, and the hard, cold facts of the outcome were that it might  prove to be quite costly.  </P> <P> Roberts, whom Padre Manager Jack McKeon was acclaiming before the game as the  man most responsible for the Padres' surge into the pennant race, collapsed  screaming in anguish in the dugout in the middle of the fifth inning.  </P> <P> He complained before the game of a mysterious pain in his left side that first  arose Wednesday while putting on a sweatshirt. It was diagnosed as muscle  spasms, but Roberts was not so sure.  </P> <P> "I can't even raise my arm above my head," Roberts said. "It just doesn't seem  to be getting any better, and really, there's not much I can do at the plate.  </P> <P> "But I'll keep on playing. I'll play until they have to carry me out of here."  </P> <P> Well, in the fifth, they had to do just that when Roberts collapsed on the  bench and was carried from the dugout on a stretcher into the clubhouse.  </P> <P> The diagnosis was a rib-cage muscle spasm. Roberts was taken to San Francisco  General Hospital, where he was scheduled to spend the night for observation and  evaluation. Padre officials said that they do not believe the injury is  serious, and that Roberts was feeling comfortable and breathing normally.  </P> <P> Perhaps it was just a coincidence. But after the Padres quietly watched Roberts  being carried off the field, it appeared to inspire them.  </P> <P> Padre pitcher Dennis Rasmussen shut down the Giants one-two-three in the bottom  of the fifth, and the Padres broke open the game in the top of the sixth,  scoring three runs for a 5-2 lead that they never relinquished.  </P> <P> Chris James, who entered hitting .167 (six for 36) in his past 11 games, opened  the sixth with a single up the middle.  </P> <P> Garry Templeton followed with a double into the right-field corner, scoring  James.  </P> <P> And Benito Santiago completed the one-two-three punch by lining a zero-and-two  pitch into the left-field seats for a two-run homer.  </P> <P> It was Santiago's seventh homer in his past 22 games, including his  eighth-inning homer Wednesday in the Padres' 3-2 victory over Atlanta, and it  hushed the crowd for the rest of the evening.  </P> <P> The Padres know they still have a long way to go and still cannot be taken off  the critical list, but at least for another day, the pulse is steady.  </P> <P> "We just have to take them one game at a time," McKeon said. "We had to win the  first one, and we did. Now, we'll concentrate on the second one. We're not  going to look ahead any further than that."  </P> <P> Besides the Padres' much-needed victory, there was a bonus: Gwynn went three  for five in the game and passed Will Clark (zero for three) for the National  League batting lead. Gwynn, bidding for his third consecutive batting title, is  batting .341, Clark .339.  </P> <P> "I really don't give a damn about the batting title," Gwynn said. "Not now. I  just want to win. And I want to win bad.  </P> <P> "Believe me, that's the only thing on my mind.  </P> <P> "I'd sacrifice all of my batting titles, and all my future batting titles, for  a championship."  </P> <P> Will Clark, who took over the batting lead Sept. 6, likewise said the batting  race is the least of his concerns. Not now. Not when the Giants are so close to  winning the title now.  </P> <P> "We're still in good shape," Clark said. "Actually, we're in great shape.  There's no pressure on us. We control our own destiny.  </P> <P> "They've got the pressure."  </P> <P> If the Padres indeed were under a lot of stress, they failed to show it,  overcoming a 1-0 deficit in the second, and taking a 2-1 lead in the third.  </P> <P> It was Roberts who led off the rally with a walk. Roberto Alomar followed by  hitting a ball to the warning track in center. Although center fielder Brett  Butler was under the ball, he looked at left fielder Kevin Mitchell at the last  second, and the ball dropped between them. Alomar wound up at second, and  Roberts at third.  </P> <P> Gwynn grounded out to first, scoring Roberts, while Alomar moved to third. With  the Giant infield playing in, Jack Clark failed to get the ball past him,  grounding out to shortstop Jose Uribe, who held Alomar at third.  </P> <P> No matter. James ripped a three-and-two pitch into right-center for a triple,  scoring Alomar.  </P> <P> The Giants came right back in the bottom of the third and tied the game on  right fielder Gwynn's fielding blunder. Robbie Thompson led off the inning with  a single into right field. Gwynn ran over to pick it up. Oops. The ball  trickled through his legs. Thompson kept running until he reached third.  </P> <P> Somehow, the official scorer ruled it a triple, perhaps revealing just why  Thompson leads the league with 11 this season. Will Clark wasted little time  driving him in with a sacrifice fly to deep center field, tying the game at  two.  </P> <P> After the Padres scored three runs in the sixth, the Giants threatened to come  right back when Mitchell and Matt Williams opened the sixth with back-to-back  doubles. Greg Harris came in for relief, and calmly finished out the game,  recording his fifth save of the season.  </P> <P> Padre Notes  </P> <P> Security officials at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium estimated about 6,000  people were in attendance by 8 p.m. Friday as the Padres-Giants game was shown  on the Diamond Vision scoreboard. . . . Padre pitcher Ed Whitson, who left the  game Thursday night after 2 1/3 innings with a mild strain of the bicep tendon  in his right shoulder, was given a injection Friday to reduce the swelling. "I  should be all right in about two or three days," Whitson said. "The doctors  told me I just have a tired arm. I haven't had an extra day off in months, and  I think it just wore on me." . . . Whitson's injury has put his growing cap  collection on hold. There are 16 caps, consisting primarily of college teams,  sitting atop Whitson's locker. They represent each of his 16 victories this  season. The next one, Whitson said, will be a cap from the University of  Alabama, with Florida, Mississippi and LSU caps waiting in reserve. "I must  have four boxes of caps at home."  </P> <P> Also hurting is third baseman Bip Roberts, who has a mysterious pain in his  left side. It's been diagnosed as muscle spasms, but whatever it is, Roberts  said, it's keeping him from raising his left arm above his head. "There's not  much I can do at the plate," Roberts said, "but I'll keep going out there." . .  . Padre Manager Jack McKeon, still marveling over rookie pitcher Andy Benes,  who is 4-0 with a 2.88 ERA in his past five starts, said: "He reminds me so  much of Dennis Leonard (the former Kansas City Royal 20-game winner), only this  kid's got better stuff at the same stage in their careers. He might even be  tougher. The thing I like about him is that he throws inside. He won't back  down to anybody. . . . I'll tell you what, the way the kid's pitching now, I  wouldn't hesitate to start him in the first game of the playoffs if we got  there."  </P> <P> Padre third baseman Mike Pagliarulo, visiting Candlestick Park for the first  time in his career after spending the past 4 1/2 years in the American League:  "The thing I hate about going to these new places is that I always have to ask  where the bathroom is." . . . Pagliarulo was kept out of the starting lineup  for the sixth straight game, replaced by Roberts at third, with Darrin Jackson  playing center. . . . In backup catcher Mark Parent's past five at-bats since  Aug. 27, he has four hits with one homer, one double and six RBIs. . . . The  Giant bullpen has 44 saves -- three shy of their record set in 1983. . . . The  Giants have 16 shutouts, their most since 1978, when they had 17. . . . The  Padres will play the second game of their three-game series against the Giants  at 1:05 p.m. today at Candlestick Park. Calvin Schiraldi (5-6) and Scott  Garrelts are the scheduled starters.  </P></p>

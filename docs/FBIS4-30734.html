			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Orban, chairman of the Federation of </F> Young Democrats, Fidesz, by correspondent Attila Kert at the  Fidesz election center -- live]    [Excerpts] [Kert] Good evening. Fidesz Chairman Viktor  Orban is sitting in front of me. [passage omitted] An hour ago  Imre Szekeres, executive chairman of the MSZP [Hungarian  Socialist Party], said quite definitely that the Fidesz could be  regarded as a potential coalition partner.    [Orban recording] We received no official note of any kind  about this. Regarding forming a coalition, the Fidesz National  Executive will decide. My position is well known on this issue:  I am not in favor of this cooperation. We will not enter into  informal talks. [passage omitted]    [Kert] What about the future of the liberal cooperation? You  said a few hours ago that it was on the brink of collapse. Can  this cooperation go on?    [Orban] The first thing I have to say is that the  cooperation  of the liberal parties, on which the strategy of every liberal  party was built during the election campaign, has failed.  Everybody has done rather badly. Two out of the four parties  did not even get in. We lagged behind expectations and the SZDSZ  [Alliance of Free Democrats] obtained fewer seats than in 1990.  Thus, on the basis of the voters' judgment, the whole idea of  the liberal-center proved to be an unsuccessful idea.    As to what to do now, I cannot yet say. I feel that the key  to the situation is in the hands of the SZDSZ, for they were the  ones who left the possibility of cooperating with the MSZP open.  It seems that they are willing to form a government together  with the MSZP.    [Kert] What if the two parties find themselves in opposition  to one another in parliament?    [Orban] The Fidesz National Executive will discuss this and  decide on the matter. [passage omitted]    [Kert] Many people say that Fidesz, with its negative  election campaign, contributed to the success of the MSZP.    [Orban] I do not agree with these opinions. We put two  targets in front of us: One, to bring about a replacement of the  government -- this was successful. Two, to prevent the comeback  of the old (?guard)--this was not. [passage omitted]    [Kert] Finally, what sort of future do you expect for the  Fidesz and what about your own role?    [Orban] We have to put the ranks in order. [passage omitted]  I will be a parliamentary deputy and I would like to work for a  bourgeois Hungary in parliament; I think there is a chance for  this. I do not think that the fate of Fidesz is more difficult  than in 1990. [passage omitted]    [Kert] Is it conceivable that the Fidesz will get back on  its  feet?    [Orban] Since we did not lie down, we will stand up. We will  bow our head to the winners but we will not bend our knees.  [passage omitted]</p>

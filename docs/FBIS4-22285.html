			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anatoliy Sokolov: "The Perverse Fate of the </F> `Russian Document'"]    [Text] What else will the archives of the CPSU  Central Committee reveal and to what extent can they be  believed?    U.S. President Bill Clinton has finally lifted the embargo  on  trade with Vietnam that has been in existence for three decades.  But the question of the fate of the American prisoners of war  and those missing in action during the years of war in Indochina  continues to be a stumbling block in bilateral relations between  the United States and Vietnam. This problem was aggravated  especially after Harvard University Professor Steven Morris  discovered in the archives of the CPSU Central Committee the  so-called "Russian document"--a translation of a report of the  North Vietnamese General Tran Van Quang that he allegedly  presented on 15 September 1972 at a meeting of the Politburo of  the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam. It  followed from the document that by that time 1,205 U.S. military  servicemen were being held captive. A year and a half later  Vietnam repatriated 591 Americans and announced that the  question of U.S. prisoners of war was closed. The significant  discrepancy in the figures constituted the essence of a scandal:  They said that Vietnam was "hiding" more than 600 Americans. The  U.S. mass media began to make the most diverse assumptions  regarding their possible fate, right down to the "Katyn  scenario."    Soon, at the beginning of September 1993, the subject of the  Americans missing in action arose again in connection with the  appearance of the so-called "second Russian dossier."  Representatives of the Russian section in conjunction with the  U.S.-Russian Joint Commission for POW's/MIA's during and after  World War II (SARK) turned over to their American colleagues  documents from Soviet military intelligence, according to which  there were 735 American pilots in North Vietnam at the beginning  of the 1970's, and not 386 as Hanoi had informed the United  States previously.    The public perceived both events as a sensation. But any  sensation has a reverse side--doubts about the reliability of  whatever caused the stir. But here too certain circumstances put  a person on guard.    Materials which, according to the rules of domestic  archives,  were in the category of top secret were made available to  Professor Steven Morris. Moreover, he was given the entire case,  while existing rules allow giving an investigator only a copy of  the document that interests him. Why? Let us take the liberty of  referring to the newspaper SEGODNYA, which reported that  Professor Morris had gained access to the archives of the former  CPSU Central Committee because of a certain list which included  his name among the few that were marked by a red pencil. It is  not known who made these pencil marks.    The appearance of the "second Russian dossier" coincided in  time with the forthcoming trip of the defense minister of Russia  to the United States. This, incidentally, was not the first case  when the appearance of documents from the Russian archives  "happened" to coincide with visits from political figures.  <H5>  General Quang Denies Everything </H5>   Immediately after Steven Morris's findings were made public,  a special emissary from the U.S. President, retired General John  Vessey, flew to Hanoi. There he met with the 76-year-old retired  General Tran Van Quang, who is now in charge of the Union of  Vietnamese Veterans of War. Tran Van Quang flatly denied  participating in the report found in Moscow and stated that he  had never dealt with American POW's. And Vietnamese officials  not only denied the information contained in the report but even  gave to understand that such a document could not have been  obtained by the Soviets at all.    Here the following circumstances should be taken into  account: In the report General Quang was named as the deputy  chief of the general staff of the Vietnamese People's Army, but  in September 1972 he was in command of one of the fronts in  Central Vietnam. And he held the post of deputy chief of the  general staff later, from 1974 through 1978. In 1972 he did not  go to Hanoi at all. Moreover, during the war, because of the  rules that existed at the time, Tran Van Quang never used his  real name. Right up until 1975 he was known as Bai Tien, and  even in party documents he was known by this pseudonym.    Further, according to the chain of command that existed,  Tran  Van Quang as the commander of the front could not submit direct  reports to the Politburo. In the opinion of the extremely  well-informed Vietnamese journalist Bui Tin, former deputy  editor in chief of the party newspaper NHAN DAN, who is now  living in France, "If such a document did exist, it would have  to be signed by the chief of the GlavPUR [Main Political  Administration], Colonel General Song Hao, or his deputy,  Lieutenant General Le Quang Dao, but in no case by Major General  Tran Van Quang."    Finally, the document speaks about a meeting of the  Politburo  of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam of 15  September 1972, while Vietnamese party archives do not  corroborate this fact.    As a result, at the end of his mission to Hanoi John Vessey  admitted that he had more doubts about the document's  reliability than he had before the trip, and the information he  received during the course of the visit "reinforced his opinion  that our own (United States--ed.) information is more accurate  than the information from the report found in Moscow."  <H5>  Statistics `From the Desired' </H5>   The discrepancy in the figures that arose after the  appearance of the "secret report from General Quang" could,  naturally, have been caused by ordinary "corrections" when the  information of the Special Services was submitted by the higher  leaders in the "proper form," taking their wishes and interests  into account.    It is known, for example, that one American aircraft downed  in Vietnam was accounted for in several places at the same time  and sometimes in several different provinces. Therefore in the  final total there was not one but several enemy aircraft downed.  With statistics of this kind during the years of the Vietnam War  they managed to down more aircraft of the U.S. Air Force than  participated in combat action. The "high" results made it  possible to promote North Vietnamese military servicemen and  count on more aid, including military, from the USSR and other  socialist countries.    From all appearances, such a "statistical" approach could be  used with respect to American POW's too. For the Vietnamese,  every captured American represented more than just political  value. Because the United States was prepared to bear any  material costs to gain the release of its compatriots. The more  so since a living American would "cost" much more than his  remains.    But still, the main thing is that war always means  disturbance of the usual way of life, an absence of order in  general, and therefore one can hardly speak of any kind of  systematic statistics or accounting for enemy losses (both  combat equipment and human forces) in Vietnam during those  years. Let us recall that at the meeting of the then foreign  affairs minister of Vietnam, Nguyen Co Thach, and John Vessey in  Washington in 1990, the figures from both sides for American  MIA's in the war in Indochina were given--1,700 and 2,300. The  Vietnamese agreed to accept the Pentagon's statistics,  explaining this by the fact that the United States had been  forced to keep precise account of its losses.  <H5>  Countries, Special Services, Interests... </H5>   The solution to the problem of American POW's and MIA's in  the Vietnamese War presupposes a mandatory accounting for  Soviet-Vietnamese relations, which were not always the same, but  they always felt the presence of another party--China. And the  Chinese factor had an impact both on the rapprochement and on  alienation in relations between the USSR and the Democratic  Republic of Vietnam [DRV] in various stages of the war,  especially when it came to the positions of the two countries  regarding certain political issues.    According to certain witnesses, they were extremely  unwilling  to allow Soviet military specialists access to seized American  equipment and frequently this access was granted only after the  Chinese advisers in the DRV had familiarized themselves with it.  And although the American POW's were of interest to the Soviet  Special Services, the Hanoi authorities strictly monitored their  Soviet friends, and if they allowed something it was only within  certain limits.    From an interview with retired KGB General Oleg Kalugin  published in the United States one can see that in 1978 Soviet  state security workers interrogated three Americans who were  supposed to be, as usual, in the hands of the Vietnamese and  were included in the "group of several or 10 individuals" who  remained or were detained in Vietnam after the repatriation.  Regarding these statements, the Americans announced that they  knew of only one American POW who remained in Vietnam but later  returned to the United States.    The press service of foreign intelligence of Russia did not  deny that the meeting with one American actually did occur. This  conversation with the American flyer, who was suspected of being  a member of the CIA, took place in January-February 1973, not in  1978 as Oleg Kalugin asserted. The Vietnamese authorities,  incidentally, soon informed the Soviets that the American had  refused further contacts.    It is even more incredible that U.S. POW's were turned over  to the Soviet Union. As the deputy foreign affairs minister of  Vietnam, Nguyen Di Nien, stated, Moscow did not make such a  demand. And Vietnam would not do this for very many reasons,  including because of its unwillingness to worsen its relations  with China. And not only because in the East the proverb "A  close neighbor is better than a distant relative" has the force  of law. It is simply that Vietnam has always tried to take into  account to its own advantage the complex nature of relations  between the USSR and the PRC.    One can assume that with respect to American POW's the  Soviets too could speak only of a tactical interest,  ways and means of waging battle, that is, information which  could have been obtained from the flyers. But much more  important was the strategic interest, the common  goals of the war. The captured American pilots did not have this  information, and the individuals who had it, naturally, did not  fly in combat aircraft.    Therefore assertions about the possibility that Americans  participating the Vietnamese War spent some time in the USSR are  not convincing. The only thing that was possible was a  transit through Moscow by Americans who had deserted  from the army and were leaving Asia for Europe. That was the  route, for example, of the Americans who went from Tokyo to  Stockholm for the conference in defense of Vietnam.  Incidentally, in the opinion of Robert Neel, White House deputy  chief of staff who spent the summer of 1993 in Vietnam, many  Americans who were thought to be missing in action were actually  alive but had deserted from the army and were living in Thailand.  <H5>  Who Is the Author of the `Russian Dossier' </H5>   As we know, the Joint Commission confirmed the authenticity  of the Russian version of the "secret report of General  Kalugin," while at the same time admitting that there were  certain mistakes in it. Of course, one should not intervene in  the sphere of another's professional interests, but nonetheless  it is the admission of these mistakes and other circumstances  that make it possible to make certain assumptions. First, it was  practically impossible for the Soviet workers to obtain  information directly from such a fairly important military  leader as Tran Van Quang. Any contacts between the Vietnamese  and foreigners were difficult, and unsanctioned communication  with representatives of other states (even friendly ones) could  have the direst consequences for Vietnamese citizens. The  communication that was permitted occurred within a strict  framework and the authorities, naturally, were informed both  about the meetings themselves and about their content.    Therefore even the report found by Steven Morris should  apparently be regarded more as the result of a generalization of  certain information obtained by Soviet Special Services from  various sources. Intelligence gleans and gives form to  information through closed channels without presenting it for  public judgment. And if there are mistakes--and they also  occur--nobody but the consumer knows about them. So the  authorship of the "first Russian dossier" can also be regarded  from the position reported by the former Soviet intelligence  agent, Vladimir Kozhmekin, who admitted that both he and his  colleagues, frequently, when they "dug up valuable and useful  information by the method of analyzing information flows,"  ascribed it to a specific "source," a foreigner.  <H5>  The `Vietnamese Syndrome' Lives </H5>   It is known that in the United States there is a powerful  lobby of public organizations and individual politicians who  think that the Vietnamese are still concealing information about  American POW's and are keeping them in Vietnam in secret camps  and shelters in mountain regions with difficult access. Among  those who spoke out against withdrawing the trade embargo on  Vietnam were the Veterans of Foreign Wars (2.2 million members)  and American Disabled War Veterans (1.2 million members), the  National League of Families of American POW's and MIA's in  Southeast Asia, the Republican Senator Robert Smith, the former  POW Orson Sweeney, a close assistant to Ross Perot, and other  politicians.    There is also a "Vietnamese point" in the biography of the  American president--his evasion of the draft during the Vietnam  War. Therefore in the question of POW's Bill Clinton has had to  be more circumspect than his predecessors in the presidential  office. He has had to demonstrate to Americans, especially those  who are against any relaxation of the American position with  respect to Vietnam, how important he considers military  questions to be in the system of national tasks and values of  the United States. And here he cannot but take into account the  extremely large Vietnamese diaspora and the clearly expressed  extremist tendencies inherent in it.    It is the Vietnamese immigrants, mainly from South Vietnam,  who are most stubbornly insisting on positions of irreconcilable  confrontation and political and economic pressure on Vietnam.  And they are also very frequently involved in the disclosure of  various sensational reports related to the "discovery" of new  facts about American POW's in Vietnam.    All these circumstances make us take a new look at the very  problem of Vietnamese-American relations. And then the question  of the American MIA's in the war in Indochina appears to a  considerable degree as a problem of political life within the  United States.    Therefore it seems important to get rid of all the  politicization, ideological cliches, and all kinds of  exaggerations and understatements pertaining to all the work  involved in searching for American MIA's. Because, for instance,  according to the military historian V. Galitskiy, during the  course of the work of the Joint Commission the Russians received  from the Americans a list of 3,752 MIA's. Later it was learned  that more than one-fourth of the names included on this list had  returned home long ago after being held captive or other  circumstances. It is difficult not to agree with Galitskiy when  he says that the U.S. Special Services when investigating  American MIA's were more interested in pursuing the goal of  establishing the nature and results of the work of the Special  Services of the former USSR in dealing with American POW's.  Personal and professional ambitions of the corresponding  departments and services are hardly appropriate when solving  such a delicate problem.  <H5>  American Wings for the Vietnamese Dragon </H5>   Nonetheless, Clinton decided to lift the embargo. And most  likely because Washington is well aware that the Vietnamese  market offers broad potential for capital investments and trade.  And this is especially important in the current economic  situation where the United States could be deprived of certain  commercial advantages if it is slow in establishing effective  political relations with Vietnam. It seems that American  businessmen are afraid that when they return to Vietnam there  will be Japanese waiting for them there. Moreover, Vietnam is  undoubtedly of a certain strategic interest for the United  States if one takes into account the ambiguity of the  aspirations of the PRC in the region of the South China Sea and  the growing concern of the countries of the region in this  regard.    As for Vietnam, it is trying to attract American business to  the country because, among other things, it wants to counteract  both China's growing political and economic might and Japan's  trade influence.    Thus both the United States and Vietnam understand that the  language of alienation is the language of the past.    Naturally, Bill Clinton understands all this and is taking  it  into account, and he himself has said repeatedly that he has an  economic vision of the world, not a political one. The process  of normalizing relations with Vietnam has actually begun, and it  is proceeding in stages and is linked to the receipt of new  confirmations from Hanoi concerning readiness to cooperate with  the United States in solving the problem of the American MIA's.</p>

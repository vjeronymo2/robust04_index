			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: APV trades heavily Engineering group APV was yesterday's most actively traded share, down 35 1/2 to 83p following a halved interim dividend. The half-year statement plainly caught the market on the hop and the day's turnover topped 13m shares. Profits were ahead but the company spoke gloomily about the need to restructure its liquid food side and the squeeze on non-UK margins. Europe accounts for some 40 per cent of group sales. T&amp;N eased 5 to 220p on the news that it had taken a Pounds 100m-plus option to buy a controlling stake in German car component group Kolbenschmidt. Market concern centred on the German company's heavy borrowings. Rolls-Royce shed 1 1/2 to 182 1/2 p, not helped by market talk of knock-on effect to RR of a Far Eastern airline going slow on payment for a large airline order. Unusual trading patterns in Zeneca saw the shares fall 5 to 830p in spite of announcements that the company had filed a new prostate drug application with the US Food and Drug Administration and appointed a new chairman designate, Sir Sydney Lipworth. The shares have outperformed the market recently, fuelled by bid hopes. A vaccine tie-up between Medeva and SmithKline Beecham gave a boost to the former, up 9 at 151p. SmithKline 'A' put on 6 at 434p. Granada was the outstanding performer in an otherwise lacklustre leisure sector, with the shares staging a strong recovery after the recent bout of weakness which earlier this week drove the shares down to their lowest point since December 1993. This had been caused by persistent suggestions that Granada was about to make a substantial acquisition, rumoured to be Gardner Merchant, the catering group. In spite of constant assurances from sources close to Granada that a move to buy Gardner was not about to happen the market remained unconvinced. But strong support for Granada shares from Hoare Govett, Granada's own broker, seemed to have allayed those fears yesterday. Granada shares closed 14 1/2 higher at 490 1/2 p after turnover of 2m. Kwik-Fit, the motor services group, bounced 6 1/2 to 154p following good interim results which led some securities houses to edge up their full-year profits forecasts. Troubled transport group Tiphook dipped 1 to 37p following one of the stormiest annual meetings of the year involving allegations from the floor. Against the market trend, British Airways weakened further, dipping 4 to 389p. Dealers noted persistent support for many of the building materials and construction shares after the damage inflicted on the sector by this week's rise in domestic interest rates. Demand was fuelled by a note issued by Credit Lyonnais Laing, the securities house, which said that 'assuming the government's pre-emptive rate rise lessens the risk of a rerun of the boom to bust cycle, we believe it is too early to move underweight in the sectors and recommend a selective balanced portfolio'. Mirror Group shed 4 to 131p as analysts downgraded following the announcement of a sharp setback in interim profits and a warning that the newspaper price war would hit full-year profits by more than the market had anticipated. SG Warburg, which remained a buyer, nevertheless downgraded by Pounds 8.2m to Pounds 71.2m. Courtaulds Textiles moved ahead 13 to 511p in spite of reporting a fall in interim profits to Pounds 10.1m from Pounds 13.7m. Home furnishings group MFI rose 6 1/2 to 142p on announcing that sales for the first 19 weeks of the current year were 10 per cent above the comparable period of last year. United Biscuits shed a penny to 319p on disappointment over half-year results. Hawtal Whiting, the motor industry design and engineering consultancy, leaped 65 to 286p following a 400 per cent rise in first-half profits. Other statistics, Page 35</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Our colleague [name indistinct] has just arrived  from Kanombe airport in Kigali and brings us news from the area.  [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Here is the Rwandan Patriotic Army [RPA]  commander in chief, Paul Kagame. The RPA have captured the  Kanombe barracks and the Kanombe airport. What have you  accomplished?    [Kagame] We have succeeded in capturing two places as part  of  our efforts to capture Kigali and restore peace to Kigali. This  will be the beginning of the restoration of peace throughout the  country. This is important because the airport has many uses.  We also found a lot of military equipment, which will help us  in our work in case talks do not succeed.    [Correspondent] Looking at your targets, are you happy with  your achievements?    [Kagame] We are happy with our achievements. Many people  have been killed unjustly. Many have died but we have been able  to save many others who might not be alive had we not done the  work. We can continue to carry out the job. I think that our  victories will allow us to bring the killers to justice. What  is necessary is for our force to bring these people to justice.

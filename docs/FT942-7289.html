			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / People: Knapton quits Lazards for L&amp;G Peter Knapton, who had stayed a brief year as chief investment officer of Lazard Brothers, has quit to become managing director of the securities side of Legal &amp; General. David Rough, group director of investments, had previously been doing the job himself. However, he is effectively number two to chief executive David Prosser, according to Knapton, and the company reckoned it needed someone specifically to manage the group's quoted investments and to chair the investment strategy committee. The heads of the property and venture capital divisions also report, alongside Knapton, to Rough. Knapton says the head-hunters were 'reasonably persuasive' and claims he was enjoying himself at Lazards. 'Jobs like this don't come up very regularly, and when they do, the timing is never going to be ideal,' says the father of seven daughters. However, the rest of the industry suspects that he had yet to fit into the cliquey senior management at Lazards - which has, moreover, struggled to become anything other than a niche player in the investment business; it has Pounds 5bn under management. Legal &amp; General is one of the biggest passive fund managers in London - with group investments under management of Pounds 30bn plus. Knapton says his task is not to lead it, say, aggressively into active techniques. His preferred style is not to 'come in and shake things up' but rather to 'try to build a team of people who work well together. Legal &amp; General has a perfectly reasonable track record and perfectly reasonable people.' While his first job in the City was with National Provident, he had stayed away from insurance companies until now. He came to Lazards from Invesco.</p>

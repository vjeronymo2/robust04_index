			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (1): A stronger momentum - A traditional industry that has for decades been the backbone of the west's heavy equipment sector is responding impressively to a variety of challenges which have transformed its manufacturing base THROUGHOUT the past two years of recession in many world markets for capital goods, the power generating equipment business has maintained a healthy momentum, fuelled by factors that promise to preserve its role as one of the most durable sectors of engineering in the 1990s. Events such as the privatisation of UK electricity supply have given the power equipment industry a short, sharp shock but in general the external influences on it are being felt at a more gradual pace. Some are double edged - rising pressure from environmentalists is one factor underpinning growth forecasts for combined cycle gas turbine generation, but it has also reduced nuclear power plant development to a trickle outside Japan, Taiwan and Korea. And some market forces suggesting faster growth are balanced by trends pointing to slower development. The availability of gas as a power source, and means to transport it, lend further support to the development of natural gas-fired combined cycle, at least for the next 10 years, but could be offset by factors such as political influences over the pace of privatisation among big utility customers. Whether viewed on a regional or technology basis, the balance of power in the global market is changing. General Electric of the US, the world's biggest supplier, sees worldwide demand growing at an average annual rate of 2.8 per cent until the year 2001, representing 925,000MW of anticipated orders. Within this figure, the pattern of demand is altering. GE expects the US, traditionally the biggest market, to remain strong, with about 113,000GW of new capacity to be installed in the next 10 years or 20 per cent of the world total. Westinghouse, the world's second biggest supplier, forecasts annual compound growth of 2.3 per cent in the US market, and a comparable figure for western Europe. But, according to all the big suppliers, the Asia/Pacific region will be a key growth market over the next five years, accounting for 29 per cent of the world's capacity additions, says GE. Siemens, the big German supplier, expects the Asian market to account for 37 per cent of expected world demand over the next decade. Both these projections exclude India, which GE sees as a major developing market with an emerging middle class of nearly 200m people driving new capacity demands. Elsewhere, the US supplier sees an 'exciting' but uncertain market outlook for eastern Europe, a view on which Westinghouse and the other suppliers concur. Similar changes in the technology mix are predicted. While GE foresees nuclear power dropping from 10 per cent of total 1987-91 orders to 6 per cent from 1996-2001, combined cycle and gas turbine orders will collectively rise from 39 per cent in 1987-91 to 43 per cent in 1992-95, slipping to 38 per cent in 1996-2001. The latter figure, however, is based on total orders of 636,000MW, nearly twice as much as the 336,000MW ordered between 1987 and 1991. Mr David Genever-Watling, senior vice president at GE Industrial and Power Systems, notes that the company has boosted its gas turbine and combined cycle forecast by 15 per cent from last year, due partly to reduced worries about gas availability. Within the total mix, it is important also to note the healthy forecasts being made for smaller-scale combined heat and power (CHP) equipment. A report this month by Frost &amp; Sullivan, the international market research publisher, says environmental concerns in Europe are now starting to affect buying decisions for CHP equipment which has in the past been used mainly for cost-saving. For the equipment suppliers the global environment requires a response that combines heavy spending on technology with corporate activity to ensure a competitive position in markets which vary in the degree of openness and fairness to suppliers, and where winning contracts is normally just the start of a very politically-charged process which extends through the supply chain to the cost of electricity. The primary focus of the big manufacturers' R&amp;D programmes is to achieve further improvements in gas turbine thermal efficiency, but the major progress made over the past decade has been replaced by an era of fine tuning. In combined cycle formation, gas turbines are achieving thermal efficiency of 55 per cent, and it could take a decade or more to reach 60 per cent. By that time, the availability of gas as a fuel source for power could well be coming under question in many countries. But improved thermal efficiencies could hold the key to widespread commercial exploitation of Integrated Gas Combined Cycle (IGCC). This uses gasified coal as a fuel source for the gas turbine but, at 44-45 per cent efficiency, lags behind natural-gas combined cycle. The corporate response takes a number of forms, but is in any case closely linked to technology trends. The European mega-mergers of the late 1980s, to form GEC Alsthom and Asea Brown Boveri, produced alliances that were both technologically powerful and broad in their geographic spread - and hence better able to handle the gradual relaxation of nationalist buying preferences in Europe. Both aims have been fulfilled successfully, and the deals have gone some way to reducing the manufacturing overcapacity that still bedevils the European steam turbine market. The second broad thrust is a continuing flow of licensing agreements, manufacturing deals and technology transfer agreements both between western companies alone and between western suppliers and their counterparts in fast-growing developing markets. In the former category, the most significant deal since the late 1980s was announced last month, and saw Rolls-Royce of the UK agree to transfer its advanced aero-engine technology to Westinghouse for use in the US company's combustion turbine designs. Mr Frank Bakos, vice-president and general manager of Westinghouse's power generation business unit, says the company was looking for ways to extend its market presence, and recognised its relative lack of aero-engine technology as a technology shortfall. The deal, he says, is 'part of a process of being competitive in each section of the market.' Observers at rival companies believe the deal will make the already existing Westinghouse-Mitsubishi grouping a stronger player in world power generation markets. Westinghouse's deal is with Rolls-Royce, but the US company will be able to sublicense the technology to Mitsubishi and Fiat, its other partner, if it believes it is appropriate. Other deals have been designed to secure a more entrenched position in Asian markets, via local manufacturing or technology transfer, or to establish a foothold in eastern Europe. The announcement last year of a big power equipment joint venture between Siemens and Skoda Pilsen of Czechoslovakia was the most important single move in this direction. But the future of the east European market is one of the big unresolved questions for the industry, which has been complaining recently about the lack of western finance available to support much-needed cleaner power generation. A further problem, at least for the US suppliers, is the so-called Fortress Europe provisions of the European Community's Utilities Directive on public procurement. For Westinghouse, obtaining acceptable access to the EC market via Rolls-Royce was a further strategic reason for last month's deal, and the near-impossibility, in some circumstances, for importers to win business directly has also prompted GE's business alliances.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Tokyo plans industrial tariff cuts JAPAN will announce tariff cuts on a range of industrial items in imminent multilateral negotiations, but has apparently decided not to replace its rice import ban with a new tariff schedule. The Japanese proposals, to be presented on March 1 in the Uruguay Round talks, provide for average industrial tariffs to be cut from 3.6 to 1.9 per cent, improving on its offer to reduce the level to 2.4 per cent. But the agriculture ministry insists a concession on rice imports is not needed, despite a Gatt directive that member nations submit by this weekend a list of tariffs to replace all bans and other import curbs on food items. The foreign ministry said yesterday the tariffication of rice imports was still being discussed, but the government had tacitly agreed rice would be either left off the list or mentioned, though no tariff figure will be proposed. Japanese officials admit fresh political scandals have prompted the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to keep the rice import ban. The popularity rating of Premier Kiichi Miyazawa has dipped over the past few weeks, and the LDP fears a concession on rice will quicken that decline. Farm officials say the US and EC have yet to settle their differences over food trade, and Japan would be foolish to submit a tariff figure for rice at this stage. They suggest the longer Japan holds out against foreign pressure, the more the government can argue it defended farmers' interests. Mr Michio Watanabe, deputy prime minister and foreign minister, has suggested an initial rice tariff of 700 per cent would successfully limit the flow of rice imports, but the agriculture ministry argues Japan would compromise its negotiating position by submitting a figure on March 1. As for industrial products, Japan will propose tariffs be scrapped on about 1,000 items, including transportation machinery. But the government has yet to decide on rates for non-ferrous metals, for which the US and EC have demanded cuts, while the tariff for leather products, important politically, is likely to be cut from about 60 to 40 per cent.</p>

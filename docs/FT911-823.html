			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar and sterling firmer THE DOLLAR ended firmer in London after quiet trading. There is no important economic news due until tomorrow's US producer price index, and the dollar rose nervously in a thin market on a report that Iraqi anti-aircraft fire had been aimed at a US Navy jet on Tuesday. There was also nervousness as traders waited to see the result of last night's 10-year US Treasury note sale and today's 30-year bond auction. Sentiment surrounding the US currency received a boost from comments by Mr Robert Mcteer, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas president. He told a US congressional sub-committee that banks in his region are beginning to see signs of recovery, and that 'the transition (of banks) to profitability is encouraging' after the losses of the last four years. Mr Mcteer's remarks were reinforced by his counterparts in Chicago and Boston, who were optimistic on the subject of improving credit availability, when addressing the sub-committee. At the London close the dollar had climbed to DM1.7330 from DM1.7210; to Y138.30 from Y137.95; to SFr1.4655 from SFr1.4580; and to FFr5.8650 from FFr5.8275. Its index moved up to 66.2 from 66.0. Instability in eastern Europe also lent support to the dollar at the expense of the D-Mark. US President George Bush strongly defended Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, shortly before he met leaders from the Baltic Republics in Washington. Mr Vytautas Landsbergis, president of Lithuania, speaking before his meeting with Mr Bush, threatened to assist in the break-up of the Soviet Union if there is not a swift move towards Baltic independence. The D-Mark was among the weaker members of the European exchange rate mechanism. It also gave ground to the Japanese yen, slipping to Y79.80 from Y80.15 in London. The yen was supported by fading expectations of a cut in the Japanese discount rate. The Bank of Japan will wait to confirm an economic slowdown, possibly for about a month, before deciding whether to change its tight monetary policy, according to an official at the central bank. Sterling lost ground to the dollar, but was steady in terms of the yen and improved against most of its partners in the ERM. Reduced political risk supported the pound, after last week's poor local election results for the ruling UK Conservative party appeared to put back the likely date of a general election. The pound shed 30 points to Dollars 1.7180. It was unchanged at Y237.50 and rose to DM2.9775 from DM2.9625; to FFr10.0750 from FFr10.0300; and to SFr2.5175 from SFr2.5100. Its index climbed 0.3 to 91.8. In New York, sterling improved 20 points to end at Dollars 1.7200. Sterling was third strongest in the ERM, with the peseta steady at the top. Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spanish prime minister, said in London that the peseta is too high, endangering Spain's export position.</p>

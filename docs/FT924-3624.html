			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Surveys disagree on buying trends CONSUMER confidence re-mains low, according to one of two surveys published today. The other survey says high street loan inquiries are on the rise. Sharp cuts in interest rates and the devaluation of sterling have failed so far to boost consumer confidence, according to PA Cambridge Economic Consultants, a private-sector economic research company. It completed its latest quarterly survey of consumer trends on November 29. It shows confidence at a new low, with consumers expecting to spend less now than they did a year ago. But Infolink, Britain's largest credit information organisation, said October saw the first rise in consumer credit inquiries for two years. Ms Nevia McKiernan, managing director, added: 'Figures from more recent weeks indicate that consumers are more confident this Christmas than last.' She said the figures represented credit inquiries, not sales. 'It typically takes about six weeks between an inquiry and a sale.' The PA survey indicated that a third of people felt they had been affected by the fall in interest rates. Only 13 per cent said they had reacted by increasing consumption, while 20 per cent had increased savings or cut debt. Two thirds of respondents thought the bottom of the recession was still more than six months away. In September 1991, fewer than half thought so. The fall in interest rates seems to have changed consumers' priorities: unemployment has replaced housing costs as the main indicator for economic recovery. Respondents were increasingly divided on the outlook for employment. More expected job losses at their places of work, but there was also a small increase in the number expecting staff to be taken on. The uncertainty seems to have made potential property buyers more cautious. Only 6.1 per cent of respondents said they were thinking of buying a house or flat in the next year, compared with 9.1 per cent last December. Confidence in the government continued to fall. In June, PA found that 30 per cent of respondents had little or no confidence in the government. That rose to 46 per cent in September and reached 53 per cent in the latest survey. 'Consumers are not yet convinced by the new assurances of a government so recently forced to turn its back on most of the central aspects of its old economic policy,' PA said. Infolink said new car loan credit inquiries were 0.7 per cent up on the previous October. In the retail sector, the figure was 2.1 per cent. Dr Brian Bailey, chairman, cautioned that last year had been a poor year for car sales and that a trend had not yet been established. Demand for credit from finance houses, which are involved in offering loans on consumer durables, continued to decline but more slowly.</p>

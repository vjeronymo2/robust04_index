			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Francis Deron: "Mr. Balladur Will Not Have </F> Contacts with Chinese Dissidents"]    [Text] Beijing -- There is one thing which Beijing does  not do in the sphere of foreign relations: predict the future.  We should, therefore, pay attention to the statement made on  Thursday, 31 March, by the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman  when he announced the visit to Beijing and Shanghai 7-10 April  by Mr. Balladur, the first French Government chief to visit  China in 16 years, after a quarrel lasting two years.    Claiming to be answering a question he was asked on possible  contracts which could be signed during the visit, spokesman Wu  Jianmin said in his weekly meeting with the press that the  improvement in political relations was bound to benefit  bilateral "economic and commercial cooperation." This can be  interpreted to mean that no contracts will be signed during the  visit, described as "important," but primarily aimed, in the  mind of the Beijing authorities, at erasing the "mistake" made  by Paris in selling arms to Taiwan. This is not really a  surprise, but it is rare for China to take the trouble to  clarify things in advance to this extent.    It is true that Edouard Balladur has made it known that he  is  not coming to Beijing as a foreign trade representative, but  that his visit is of a symbolic nature likely to revive  bilateral relations. This may partly explain some of the pomp of  the visit. The prime minister will be accompanied in theory by  around 30 senior civil servants and around 60 journalists, but  also by no fewer than 50 personal guests, including one of his  sons, his driver, and two head waiters. During his visit in  November, German Chancellor Kohl also brought a large  delegation, but one mostly made up of businessmen.    Mr. Balladur will reside at the state residence of the  Fishermen's Terrace --the former residence of the Manchurian  Empire's grand eunuchs, situated in the west of Beijing. Turned  into a hotel for foreign dignitaries, it also houses the most  select and expensive private club in post-Maoist China. The  prime minister and his delegation will be granted the great  privilege of entering the Forbidden City by car to visit some of  the imperial apartments. In his two days in Beijing, in addition  to the Chinese leaders, Mr. Balladur will meet with selected  representatives of the French business community, as he will in  Shanghai.    In terms with the people, he will host a dinner at the  French  ambassador's residence for several prominent figures, including  one of Deng Xiaoping's daughters, the painter Deng Ling. In  Shanghai, the prime minister will have a short meeting with  local economic officials. If all goes as expected, the  political police will prevent him from having to settle the  dilemma which the presence in Beijing of prominent dissidents  would have presented for him -- most of them, including Wei  Jingsheng, were moved elsewhere more than a month ago.</p>

			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S. AFRICA RULING PARTY'S WHITE SUPPORT WAVERS AS VOTE NEARS  </P> <P> White South Africa's problem, as voter Peter Gray sees it, is that the  Conservative Party would create "economic disaster" by antagonizing the world,  and the liberal Democratic Party would allow black revolutionaries to trample  over the white minority.  </P> <P> What the country needs is "something middle of the road but more  liberal-minded" than in the past, the banker believes.  </P> <P> That's why Gray, and many whites like him, will probably be voting, somewhat  reluctantly, for the National Party in South Africa's Sept. 6 parliamentary  elections, one of the most important in 41 years of apartheid and Nationalist  rule.  </P> <P> "I want South Africa to speed up (apartheid) reform," Gray said recently as he  and his wife waited in a primary school gymnasium in Johannesburg's northern  suburbs to hear President Frederik W. de Klerk address a political meeting.  </P> <P> "But we South Africans are scared by what we've seen happen to whites in the  rest of Africa," Gray added. "We're in a minority, and we would need  protection. How they're going to do that is the question."  </P> <P> In two weeks, 5.5 million whites, Indians and mixed-raced Coloreds will select  racially segregated chambers of Parliament while the country's 26 million  disfranchised blacks watch from the sidelines.  </P> <P> De Klerk's National Party is all but guaranteed a majority in the controlling  white chamber, despite stiff challenges from the Conservatives on the right and  the Democrats on the left. But its margin of victory, and the enthusiasm of its  support, may be at the lowest level in its history.  </P> <P> Many white voters remain skeptical about the Nationalists' promises of "new  action" and dialogue with black leaders. Even a few government supporters have  complained that the campaign lacks the ideological fire of days gone by.  </P> <P> In the ward represented by the retiring leader of liberal white politics, Helen  Suzman, De Klerk was heckled relentlessly in one of his first outings since  being sworn in as state president following this month's sudden, ignominious  resignation of Pieter W. Botha, 73.  </P> <P> Above the door to the Houghton Primary School, a National Party campaign poster  read: "Reject Racism." But a cluster of hand-lettered signs near it suggested  how difficult it is to change attitudes among white South Africans. Above the  sign reading "Firearms must be handed in at the lobby" was another put up just  for the event: "Right of admission reserved."  </P> <P> Inside, an all-white audience had filled all 400 plastic chairs and standing  space, spilling into the lobby, where a Democratic Party heckler and a De Klerk  supporter almost came to blows.  </P> <P> The battle in this ward is between the National Party's Dr. Shlomo Peer, a  retired businessman and Jewish immigrant, and the Democratic Party's Tony Leon,  a charismatic young Johannesburg City Council politician. Not surprisingly, the  two men are getting competing signals from voters.  </P> <P> "People are frightened of the left," Peer said in an interview. "They are  telling me they want economic and political security."  </P> <P> But Leon says he has tapped "a real and conspicuous feeling that the National  Party just hasn't delivered." Leon notes, for example, that the economy has  deteriorated sharply, with inflation running at more than 15%, home loan rates  of 20% and a steady weakening in the value of the South African rand.  </P> <P> For those and other reasons, white support for the National Party is softening  for the first time in four decades, according to Steven Friedman of the South  African Institute of Race Relations.  </P> <P> "It is no longer an act of betrayal for many whites to vote against the ruling  party," Friedman wrote recently. "The Nats are increasingly having to win white  support rather than take it for granted."  </P> <P> The National Party currently holds 120 of the 166 seats in the white chamber of  Parliament, the Conservatives 22 seats and the Democrats 19. Opinion surveys  last month indicated that the National Party is losing votes to both the left  and right, and political analysts think the Conservatives could pick up as many  as 20 seats and the Democrats could add a dozen or more. That would saddle the  government with its largest white opposition in years.  </P> <P> To lure undecided voters from opposite ends of the political spectrum, De Klerk  has been widening his party's hold on the mainstream. The status quo in South  Africa will have to change, he tells his audiences. But not too quickly, he  adds.  </P> <P> The National Party vows to maintain racially segregated residential areas,  schools and hospitals, but it also says it wants to change the constitution to  share political power with blacks and eventually rule the country by consensus,  rather than one-person, one-vote.  </P> <P> On the right, the Conservative Party platform calls for a return to 1960s-style  apartheid and it advocates dividing South Africa into separate geographic  regions by race. In the "white state," for example, blacks could work but their  activities would be monitored, and whites would govern.  </P> <P> National Party supporters say the Conservatives' policies would invite  additional sanctions, ruin the country's economy and probably trigger  widespread black unrest.  </P> <P> But the Conservative Party, formed in 1982 from a National Party split, has  grabbed many defecting Nationalists, especially among working-class whites, who  don't want to compete for jobs or share their neighborhoods, schools,  hospitals, beaches or parks with blacks.  </P> <P> To the left of the government are the Democrats, a new party formed by a merger  of the Progressive Federal Party and two smaller parties. The Democrats' power  base is well-to-do white suburbanites, such as lawyers, academics and  businessmen.  </P> <P> The Democrats advocate government negotiations with the outlawed liberation  group, the African National Congress, an end to the three-year-old state of  emergency and the release of all political prisoners. Only then, they say, will  the country be able to prove to the black majority and to the world that it is  serious about reform.  </P> <P> The Democrats want to change the constitution, too. They would institute a  one-person, one-vote system modeled on the American federal system, dividing  the country into geographic rather than racial groups and giving each region  proportional representation.  </P> <P> The National Party, which has refused to negotiate with the ANC unless it  renounces violence, has tried to paint the Democrats as naive do-gooders who  are too soft on security and too cozy with black revolutionaries.  </P> <P> The government's recent crackdown on a campaign of anti-apartheid civil  disobedience, using legions of policemen armed with whips to break up dozens of  gatherings and detaining key leaders without trial, has been seen here as an  attempt to show the electorate that the threat of violence from black  organizations continues and that it will be dealt with firmly.  </P> <P> While the Nationalists were attempting to hold the middle ground, though, they  discovered an ideological split in their own ranks. The blowup that led to  President Botha's Aug. 14 resignation stemmed from a disagreement over a  meeting that De Klerk, the party leader and Botha's heir apparent, planned with  Zambian President Kenneth D. Kaunda.  </P> <P> Although Botha's resignation was more the result of months of ill feeling  toward his own party, his bitter farewell speech criticized De Klerk's  willingness to meet Kaunda, an advocate of sanctions against South Africa and  host to the ANC, the principal guerrilla group fighting Pretoria.  </P> <P> The Botha-De Klerk dispute was not expected to have a broad impact on the  election, but the Conservative Party has taken the opportunity to suggest that  the National Party might trade white rights in exchange for peace with the ANC.  </P> <P> Among many National Party stalwarts, however, Botha's departure was seen as an  unseemly burial that was necessary to begin the program of "new action."  Foreign Minister Roelof F. (Pik) Botha himself told a national TV audience  that, "with great respect, I must say that (Botha's) memory is sometimes  faulty."  </P> <P> "I'm glad it came to a head," said Neels Brits, a Johannesburg businessman and  third-generation Nationalist. "We have compassion for the man (Botha). But the  simple matter is, there's nothing wrong with the Kaunda visit."  </P></p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: South Korea tries to woo more foreign investors - Measures to breathe life into one of Asia's worst performers South Korea is forging ahead with plans to widen foreign ownership of shares this autumn, but analysts in Seoul doubt whether the latest moves will be sufficient to revitalise the stock market - one of the worst performers in Asia this year. Since the start of 1992, foreigners have been allowed to invest directly in companies listed on the Seoul stock exchange. Most companies have a 10 per cent ceiling on foreign ownership, with individual foreign investors allowed no more than 3 per cent of the shares. Although foreigners have not been been allowed to invest in certain 'strategic' companies, the authorities are gradually easing these restrictions. Last Tuesday, shareholders in Pohang Iron and Steel (Posco), the world's third largest steel group, voted in favour of allowing foreign investors to own up to 8 per cent of the company. Next month, Korea Electric Power (known as Kepco), the state-controlled electricity generator and supplier, is also expected to allow foreign ownership of its shares. Stock brokers reported only muted international interest in Posco's shares last week after the restrictions had been lifted. Foreigners may have been deterred by the fact that the world steel industry is having a difficult time, brokers say. However, Kepco is expected to attract more attention from foreign investors, given its monopoly position and the fact that it is in a sector which is viewed more favourably by fund managers. On top of these measures, foreign securities houses in Seoul hope that the ministry of finance will raise the limits on ownership still further, allowing foreigners to invest directly in up to 25 per cent of a company's shares without needing to seek special approval. Since the opening of the Korean stock market to direct foreign investment in January this year, there has hardly been a stampede of foreign funds. Net investment inflow from foreigners amounted to USDollars 997m, according to the Securities Supervisory Board, well below expectations. International investors have been deterred by the 10 per cent limit on ownership which makes it difficult for large investors to buy 'reasonable' amounts - of Dollars 5m or more. A further opening of the market could provide a welcome shot in the arm for Korean equities, which have dropped steadily over the last three-and-a-half years. The composite index has tumbled from its high of 1,007.77 on April 1, 1989, to a low of 459.07 on August 21 this year. It has recovered slightly since then, closing at 540.45 yesterday. The market's doldrums reflect a number of concerns. Economic growth, which exceeded 12 per cent a year between 1986 and 1988, slowed down considerably in the late 1980s and is expected to be around 6 or 7 per cent in 1992. Since the start of the 1990s, investors have been deterred by rising inflation, high labour costs, high nominal interest rates, sluggish corporate earnings growth, and deteriorating trade and current account deficits. The government has attempted, since the autumn of 1989, to reverse the market's decline with a series of market-boosting measures. It set up a market stabilisation fund with the express purpose of buying shares and supporting stock prices. In addition, the domestic investment trusts, banks, securities houses, pension and insurance funds were instructed to buy shares, and according to the latest package of market support measures - announced in August - institutional investors must remain net buyers of stock. The measures have been to almost no avail. With the domestic institutions now sitting on an estimated Dollars 10-15bn in shares - out of a total stock market capitalisation of around Dollars 70bn - due to these enforced market support measures, some analysts predict that the upside to any recovery is likely to be fairly limited. They fear that investors are likely to dump shares as soon as the index reaches a threshold of around 800 to 850. The more optimistic domestic stock brokers believe that the market will pick up again once the presidential election - due in December - is out of the way. With the appointment of a new president, the market should have a clearer picture about the government's medium-term economic policy.</p>

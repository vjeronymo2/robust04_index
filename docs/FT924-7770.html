			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Spanish rate of inflation falls Spain's headline inflation rate fell sharply in October but underlying inflation remained high and offered little prospect of a significant easing in interest rates, writes Tom Burns in Madrid. The rise in the consumer price index of just 0.1 per cent brought year-on-year inflation down by 0.6 points to 5.2 per cent. Underlying inflation, which excludes the volatile energy and non-processed food prices, rose by 0.5 per cent in October to post a year-on-year figure of 7.1 per cent.</p>

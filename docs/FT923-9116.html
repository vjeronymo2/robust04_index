			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / International Company News: Shearson in talks to sell Boston unit WALL STREET securities house Shearson Lehman Brothers confirmed last night that it is in talks to sell the Boston Company, its custodial, trust services and mortgage lending subsidiary. Shearson, which is part of financial services and travel group American Express, said in a brief statement that a number of blue-chip financial institutions had 'indicated that they believe that our subsidiary, the Boston Company, may be a natural fit with their organisations. We have put in place a rigorous and professional process to explore this interest'. However, Shearson said that negotiations were only in the preliminary phase and that no decision had been made to sell the Boston Company. Shearson said it was reviewing its strategic options but would not comment on which companies had said they were interested in the subsidiary. Shearson bought the Boston Company for Dollars 50m in 1981, and in the recently completed second quarter, the unit reported revenues of Dollars 149m.</p>

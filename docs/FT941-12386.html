			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Gains for Taiwan opposition Taiwan's governing Nationalist party has won local government elections but the main opposition Democratic Progressive party (DPP) and independent candidates made strong gains, Reuter reports from Taipei. The Nationalists won 214 of 309 village and town mayoral posts at stake in Saturday's polls, which were marred by allegations of vote-buying and campaign violence. They won 260 mayoral posts in the last elections, in 1990. The DPP more than tripled its number of mayoral seats to 21 from six. The polls will not alter the balance of power in central government.</p>

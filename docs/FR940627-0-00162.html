			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another possible Tier 3 effort could involve the testing of combinations of oxygenates. Although groups for non-baseline gasolines are defined on the basis of individual oxygenates, EPA could request additional testing to address mixtures of oxygenates under Tier 3 authority. For example, if a registered non-baseline gasoline formulation containing a mixture of oxygenates is widely produced and used, resulting in high exposures and potential health risks, EPA could require testing of this formulation under Tier 3. Tier 3 tests for this formulation could involve standard Tier 1 or Tier 2 tests, testing for other endpoints not addressed under Tier 2, or testing for other areas of concern (e.g., exposure analysis, environmental testing, etc.). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also retains the authority to require additional testing using different vehicle/engine technologies and/or emission generation specifications than those prescribed for Tier 1 and Tier 2 analyses. To reduce the costs of the program, today's action requires the use of a single vehicle model for emission generation. However, if EPA determines that emissions from other applicable vehicle/engine technologies might differ significantly for a given fuel or additive/base fuel mixture, then EPA may require additional emission characterization and/or toxicological testing under Tier 3 using different vehicle/engine technology. Also, although standard Tier 2 tests are to be conducted using non-catalyzed emissions (as discussed in Section VI.A), EPA could require the use of catalyzed emissions for testing under Tier 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When a determination has been made that Tier 3 testing is required, EPA will inform the responsible manufacturer by certified mail of the purpose and nature of the testing to be performed along with a schedule for compliance and submittal of the Tier 3 report to EPA. EPA will also publish a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , notifying the public that the letter to the manufacturer is available in the public record for review and comment. The affected manufacturer's comments and EPA's response to these comments will be placed in the public record, as well. After receipt and review of all comments received (or, if no comments are received), EPA will publish a notice of final action on the proposed Tier 3 requirements in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA proposed in the NPRM to provide the responsible manufacturer or group a 30-day comment period to respond to EPA's requirements under Tier 3. In their commentary, the regulated industry asked EPA to extend this comment period to 60 days to allow for appropriate time for review, analysis, and preparation of a written response to EPA regarding the designated protocol(s) to be used for Tier 3 tests. EPA judged that this request was reasonable, thus today's rule gives F/FA manufacturers 60 days to comment on the EPA-prescribed Tier 3 requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The responsible manufacturer is expected to submit detailed protocols for review and approval by EPA prior to beginning Tier 3 testing. Tier 3 tests must comply with the pre-approved specifications given by EPA. If manufacturers experience unforeseen difficulties while conducting the prescribed Tier 3 tests approved by EPA (e.g., excess mortality observed half-way through a chronic bioassay), they will be allowed to request a modification of the requirements. This mechanism would apply to unusual circumstances that are outside the control of the manufacturer. If testing problems are identified, EPA must be notified as soon as possible so that requirements can be modified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Criteria for Referral to Tier 3 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section presents some of the guidelines and considerations which EPA will use in determining the necessity for additional testing under a discretionary Tier 3 testing approach. Consistent with the discretionary decision-making process for Tier 3, this discussion is not intended to provide an exhaustive, limiting, or definitive listing of relevant criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The decision to require manufacturers to submit additional testing on the health, environmental, or welfare effects of F/FA emissions will take into account the cumulative information provided by Tiers 1 and 2, including previous scientific data, emissions characterization data, biological test results, and any ancillary information which may be available to EPA. Thus, decisions to require Tier 3 level testing will be made only after all the requirements of Tiers 1 and 2 have been adequately satisfied (with the exception of special cases as discussed in Section VIII.D). Adherence to this principle will prevent unnecessarily costly or poorly targeted decisions based on piecemeal, out-of-context information, and will promote more precise identification and evaluation of data gaps, and more cost-efficient coordination of potential test requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ultimately, EPA must be able to decide whether or not the use of a fuel or fuel additive is likely to create unacceptable health or welfare risks. If a risk decision is made possible by the information from Tiers 1 and 2, then Tier 3 will not be required. However, if such a risk decision cannot be made on the basis of the Tiers 1 and 2 data, then Tier 3 testing will be mandated. Therefore, to make a determination on the need for Tier 3 testing, EPA scientists will evaluate the extent to which the results of Tiers 1 and 2 are adequate for such decisions, guided by the basic principles of risk assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A risk assessment requires the merging of a health effects assessment (including hazard identification and concentration-response relationship) and an exposure assessment. Such an assessment can range from a qualitative to a highly quantitative analysis, depending upon the extent of the available data. EPA recognizes that a quantitative assessment might not be possible at the end of Tier 2. <FOOTCITE>59</FOOTCITE>  However, Tiers 1 and 2 might indicate that little hazard is present and that exposures may be quite low and limited geographically. In such a case, there may be no reason to pursue further testing at the Tier 3 level to improve risk assessment information. On the other hand, Tiers 1 and 2 might suggest that a hazard is likely and that exposures could be significant because of the production volume and ubiquitous use of a product, but the data may still be inadequate for a quantitative risk assessment. In this case, Tier 3 testing could be indicated to provide the needed information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 59 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> However, if adequate information exists, EPA does not rule out the possibility of conducting such risk assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In general, the principles and critical data elements of the risk assessment process will provide a useful guide for identifying whether meaningful information gaps remain and for determining the specific objectives of potential Tier 3 testing. However, EPA does not intend to conduct a formal risk assessment as part of its decision on whether to promote a fuel or fuel additive (or group) to Tier 3. Rather, EPA will evaluate the quality and certainty of the toxicity and concentration-response data and consider qualitatively whether such data weighs in favor of or against further testing. A formal risk assessment will be more likely to be developed at such a time that there is a need for action to control or prohibit a product under the regulatory authority of CAA section 211(c). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Salvadoran Government has offered the United  Nations part of its Army for a future peacekeeping force,  President Armando Calderon Sol has said.    The Salvadoran president has said "El Salvador is unable to  receive Haitian refugees," but he said "what he can offer the  world is a professional, technical, and ethical armed force that  can be ready for any UN mission if it needs brave men for a  peacekeeping force."    He has said "the United Nations knows it has a very  professional armed force in El Salvador," adding the Salvadoran  Government has already expressed the Army's willingness to  assist.    The government did not reveal the number of troops offered  to  the United Nations, but he said El Salvador has helicopter  pilots with advanced training and other military specialists who  can contribute to the international community.    He has reiterated the United Nations can make the request,  "which would be considered with great appreciation, because the  Salvadoran Army is a professional and very technical Army."    Moreover, Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina has  rejected an eventual U.S. invasion of Haiti. "We reject  invasions of any country," he has said.</p>

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Letter: Beveridge: a more realistic view Sir, The memories of a Liverpool childhood for a 54-year-old give the debate on Beveridge a touch of reality mixed with gratitude for the benefits his efforts created. John Gray's description ('Truth of the Matter', December 5) of the 1990s as scarred by '. . .mass unemployment, pervasive squalor and rickety health services. . .' annoys me. His words are a gross exaggeration of those problems while they disregard the new problems developing from the breakdown of family life and ethical standards. The visionaries of the 1990s will be more accurate in their analysis. If Mr Gray were to visit Teesside he would see what a well aimed swipe of Mrs Thatcher's hand bag has achieved. Or is to be a Fellow of Jesus College simply a licence to misuse truth every day? D J Turkington, Plimsoll Publishing, Broadcasting House, Middlesborough TS1 5JA</p>

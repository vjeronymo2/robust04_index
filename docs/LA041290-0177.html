			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS / CULVER CITY;  </P> <P> VOTERS GIVE A SPLIT DECISION ON DEVELOPMENT;  </P> <P> GROWTH: STRICT HEIGHT-LIMIT INITIATIVE IS PASSED, BUT THE CANDIDATE WHO  SUPPORTED IT IS DEFEATED IN FAVOR OF TWO PRO-DEVELOPMENT CONTENDERS.  </P> <P> In a curious ending to a curious campaign, voters in Culver City elected two  pro-development candidates to the City Council on Tuesday, but approved a  stringent height-limit initiative that the winners had opposed.  </P> <P> Although the 56-foot height limit contained in the residents' initiative known  as Measure I beat a more lenient competing proposal backed by development  interests, the council candidate who backed Measure I, Tom Hammons, lost to  incumbent Jozelle Smith and Mike Balkman, who supported the milder controls  outlined in Measure II. Both measures received a majority of "yes" votes, but  Measure I is the only one adopted because it received more "yes" votes.  </P> <P> The split decision has the town abuzz with Monday-morning quarterbacking. It  startled almost everyone, particularly the candidates. It also clouded the fate  of the controversial $159-million Marina Place regional shopping mall planned  for Culver City's western tip.  </P> <P> "In the Oscars, why supposedly are the best director and the best movie always  the same?" Smith said. "In this case, they weren't." Remarked Hammons: "I'm  very puzzled."  </P> <P> Hammons, a district manager for Thrifty Drug Stores, had billed himself as a  slow-growth and grass-roots candidate. He heartily endorsed Measure I, calling  it "the people's choice." The initiative qualified for the ballot after 3,600  residents signed petitions.  </P> <P> Measure I imposes a cap of 56 feet, or about four stories, on buildings in the  city's busiest commercial zones. Criticizing that as inflexible, the City  Council majority of Smith, Richard Alexander and Paul Jacobs placed the rival  measure to the ballot. Without specifying a height limit, Measure II called for  lot-coverage limits on most commercial buildings in the city and prohibited  them from blocking views, disrupting air flow or causing "significant  detriment" by their shade, shadow or glare.  </P> <P> There was one other key difference between them. Whereas Measure I  theoretically applies to any project not yet under construction, Measure II  would have exempted any project that had received city approval, regardless of  whether construction had started -- and would therefore exempt Marina Place.  </P> <P> The 1-million-square-foot Marina Place project approved by the City Council  last month would place Nordstrom and Bullock's stores, 150 smaller shops and a  six-screen movie theater at Culver City's western edge, on a site nearly  surrounded by Los Angeles.  </P> <P> As approved by the council, the mall contains several elements that will have  to be scaled back if the terms of Measure I are applied. The theater complex is  envisioned as being 74 feet high, and there are two proposed 84-foot decorative  towers.  </P> <P> City Atty. Eleanor Egan said in an interview, however, that she believes Marina  Place will be able to get in under the wire.  </P> <P> A comprehensive agreement between the city and the developers approved by the  council last month is scheduled to be signed April 25, at the end of a required  30-day period to allow the filing of any referendum petitions seeking to  contest the agreement.  </P> <P> Although the council has the option of amending the development agreement,  according to Egan, the election of Balkman and Smith makes that unlikely. With  Councilman Paul Jacobs, they make up a council majority in favor of the project  as now proposed.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't change (the development agreement)," Balkman said, adding that he  thought the project had "gone through enough."  </P> <P> If the agreement is signed on schedule, Egan said, it will shield Marina Place  from Measure I, which is not scheduled to take effect until April 27, 10 days  after next Tuesday's City Council meeting in which the new council is expected  to certify the election results.  </P> <P> Marianne Lowenthal, general manager for Marina Place developer Prudential  Property Co., said she believed the development agreement "would stand up as it  is" despite the adoption of Measure I.  </P> <P> But Richard Pachtman, a former mayor and a sponsor of Measure I, said it is not  that simple.  </P> <P> "It would seem to me," he said, "that any councilman that would act in such a  way in the face of a measure adopted by the people would face a recall."  </P> <P> Pachtman and another sponsor of the initiative, Robin Turner, said Wednesday  that they were considering several challenges to Marina Place, including  collecting signatures to force a referendum on the development agreement.  </P> <P> They also questioned the legality of the council's rush to approve the  development agreement before the election. "It was a deliberate attempt to  subvert the will of the people," Pachtman contended.  </P> <P> Even if the mall encounters no additional obstacles in Culver City, its future  is by no means assured. The city of Los Angeles, the Venice Town Council and  the California Coastal Commission all are threatening legal challenges, based  on the traffic congestion and pollution the mall is expected to generate.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, a vocal opponent of Marina Place,  called on the new Culver City council to "reconsider its precipitous action on  Marina Place."  </P> <P> The election parties Tuesday night reflected the candidates' characters and  philosophies. Hammons and Measure I advocates converged at the home of  initiative sponsor Turner. Smith returned to Veterans Auditorium, the site of  her 1986 election celebration. Balkman, the president of an electrical  contracting company and the Culver City Lions Club, partied in a ballroom at  the Ramada Hotel in Fox Hills.  </P> <P> Even though they had campaigned against it, Balkman and Smith said that they  would not tamper with Measure I. Balkman predicted that the height limit would  be a "definite obstacle" to developers, but said, "If that's what the voters  want, that's what we do. . . . Rules are rules, laws are laws."  </P> <P> Smith said that Measure I's label of " 'people's initiative' appealed to a lot  of people who didn't take the time to read it thoroughly (and) were not that  aware of the differences between the two (measures)."  </P> <P> "But . . . we can live with that," she said. "I don't think the height limit  will be a shock to any developers," she said, considering the development  restrictions that exist in many other area communities.  </P> <P> There was some last-minute hassle Election Day, as voters were given flyers  from the city clerk's office instructing them to ignore their sample ballots  and go strictly by the ballots in the voting machines. Over the weekend it was  discovered that the sample ballots were printed incorrectly, with wrong numbers  assigned to the measures, City Clerk Pauline Dolce said. The error meant that  voters intending to vote yes on either ballot measure would in fact be voting  the opposite of what they intended if they followed the sample ballot. But  Dolce said there was "no way" the ballots for the 51 machines could have been  reprinted in time for the election.  </P> <P> The ballot mistake was just one of a series of surprises before the election.  Two weeks before the voting complaints arose of outside influence in the  council race, when a carpenters union local based in Los Angeles mailed a  letter endorsing Smith and Balkman because of their support for Marina Place.  Both candidates decried the letter as unwanted interference in the election.  </P> <P> Shortly afterward, Measure II advocates used names from the Measure I petitions  to target a campaign mailer. The petitions were unlawfully released by City  Clerk Dolce. The Measure II campaigners also failed to report they had  contributions and spending of more than $1,000, in apparent violation of state  campaign laws.  </P> <P> Measure I sponsor Pachtman has filed a complaint with the state's Fair  Political Practices Commission and has asked the district attorney's office to  investigate.  </P> <P> CULVER CITY  </P> <P> 17 of 17 Precincts  </P> <P> CITY COUNCIL  </P> <P> Two vacancies  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.66IN:1.67IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Candidate:  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Vote  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Jozelle Smith*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2,851  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Mike Balkman  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2,647  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Tom Hammons  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2,269  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> * incumbent  </P> <P> BALLOT MEASURES  </P> <P> (More than 50% needed for one to pass.

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Courtaulds improves 8% to Pounds 201.4m COURTAULDS, the specialist materials group, yesterday reported an 8 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 201.4m for the year to March 31, writes Paul Abrahams. Mr Sipko Huismans, chief executive, said the difficult economic conditions of the past two years were showing some signs of easing. The results were achieved on a turnover of Pounds 1.94bn compared with Pounds 1.91bn. The tax charge in the UK was Pounds 24.6m (Pounds 21.5m) while non-UK tax was Pounds 21.7m (Pounds 18.2m). Earnings per share increased from 36.5p to 38p. A final dividend of 9.35p makes a 13p (12p) total. The improved results mostly reflected a sharp rise in the films and fibres division where operating profits surged from Pounds 61m to Pounds 74m on turnover of Pounds 647m (Pounds 667m). Mr Huismans said the improvement resulted from the withdrawal from loss-making businesses such as carbon-fibre, advancements in the demand-supply balance and productivity gains. Operating profits at the coatings division increased from Pounds 56m to Pounds 59m on turnover of Pounds 678m (Pounds 640m). More than 20 per cent of sales growth was in the Far East. The worldwide marine business performed well, but results at protective coatings were described as sluggish. Performance materials were adversely affected by the poor state of the civil and military aviation industries. Weak demand in the US construction industry also affected the sealants market. The division made operating profits of Pounds 12m (Pounds 15m) on turnover of Pounds 183m (Pounds 179m). The packaging division reported operating profits of Pounds 25m (Pounds 21m) on turnover of Pounds 244m (Pounds 235m). Mr Huismans said margins had increased to take the overall return on sales to 10.2 per cent compared with 8.9 per cent last year. He added that greater efficiency and an improving mix of business had helped. The chemicals division made an operating profit of Pounds 42m (Pounds 38m) on turnover of Pounds 233m (Pounds 232m). The acetate operations had recovered from difficult operating conditions in the first half of the year and cigarette tow, used for filters, had continued to expand and make good margins.</p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OFFICIAL SUES FOES FOR LIBEL, SLANDER;  </P> <P> DEFENDANTS SAY CHARGES PART OF POLITICS  </P> <P> The defendants in a libel and slander lawsuit brought by San Gabriel Vice Mayor  Frank Blaszcak filed a response this week, saying campaign statements they  allegedly made about him, including assertions that he was involved in drug  sales, were merely part of fair political play.  </P> <P> In papers filed Tuesday in Pasadena Superior Court, the 12 defendants, all of  whom opposed Blaszcak in last year's City Council election, questioned the  legal basis for Blaszcak's suit, characterizing it as "an improper effort to  resist a recall effort directed at him."  </P> <P> The statements in question "do not amount to more than the usual slings and  arrows which members of society are expected to encounter -- especially when  they throw themselves into hotly contested local elections," their response  said.  </P> <P> The defendants, including a councilman, a former mayor, two former planning  commissioners and the executive director of the Chamber of Commerce, challenged  Blaszcak's claim that he had been the victim of "intentional infliction of  emotional distress" by political rivals.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Essential Element'  </P> <P> "Mr. Blaszcak certainly must have expected to meet vigorous opposition, harsh  criticism and attacks upon his character and qualifications for the office he  was seeking," the defendants said in papers prepared for them by the Los  Angeles law firm of Beck &amp; De Corso. "This has always been an essential  element of American politics."  </P> <P> Blaszcak, who filed his suit three weeks ago, said Wednesday that he had not  yet been served with the defendants' response. "Slander and libel stand on  their own," he said in responding to the assertion that allegations against him  were normal for American political campaigning.  </P> <P> Blaszcak was elected to the City Council last year after a bitterly contested  campaign as part of a three-man slate of slow-growth candidates. He faces a  recall election May 23.  </P> <P> One issue that surfaced frequently during last year's council campaign and this  year's recall drive is a charge by Santa Ana police 10 years ago that Blaszcak,  who was then that city's public information director, had offered to procure  drugs for a police officer. The allegations were investigated by the district  attorney, who decided not to file charges because of insufficient evidence.  </P> <P> During the council campaign, a flyer put out by a group called Concerned  Citizens of San Gabriel accused Blaszcak of being "involved in drug sales."  </P> <P> Some of the defendants in Blaszcak's suit were members of the group that put  out the flyer.  </P> <P> City Councilman Sabino Cici, one of the defendants, said the quick response was  an attempt by the defendants to "get into the arena."  </P> <P> "We still haven't been served with his complaint," Cici said. "He's got three  years to serve us. This could be held over our heads for a long time. If any of  us were trying to buy a home, say, we'd have to declare that we were engaged in  a lawsuit."  </P> <P> He said the defendants' response allows them to subpoena records and testimony  and to force Blaszcak to make a deposition in the presence of the defendants'  lawyer.  </P> <P> "In my opinion, it's to Frank's advantage to drop the lawsuit now and pay our  attorney," Cici said.  </P></p>

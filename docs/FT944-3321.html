			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / MPs attack MoD stores closure plan Plans to close Ministry of Defence stores and cut hundreds of jobs were fundamentally flawed, unsafe and designed to avoid public scrutiny, the cross-party Commons Defence Committee said yesterday. The committee's report says it was 'disturbed' that the ministry had decided to proceed with a single option to the exclusion of any detailed consideration of others. Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, said: 'Clearly, the Defence Cost Study is fundamentally flawed and there was no proper examination of the various options. It is quite clear from this report that the study was purely to save money and that there was little account taken of our strategic defence needs.' The committee's report attacks the lack of consultation documents and the ministry's refusal to release the study report. 'We can only assume from the amount of work which has had to be carried out subsequently that it was not as full and searching a review as it should have been.' Under the plan, depots at Eaglescliffe in Cleveland and Exeter and Wrangaton in Devon will be shut, holdings at Devonport and Rosyth cut, and central stores created at Portsmouth and at Faslane on the Clyde.

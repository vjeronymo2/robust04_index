			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Latvians to get parallel rouble The Baltic republic of Latvia yesterday introduced a parallel currency to the rouble to make up for a shortage of rouble banknotes to pay salaries, writes Leyla Boulton. Mr Einars Repshe, chairman of the Latvian central bank, said he hoped Russia, which is giving republics a choice of staying in a rouble zone or setting up their own currencies, would not take retaliatory action. The so-called Latvian rouble, which has been printed in Latvia, would co-exist with the Soviet rouble, which Russia is now calling its own. Mr Repshe said that to avoid swelling the money supply, Soviet roubles would be frozen in bank accounts and exchanged for new Latvian banknotes.</p>

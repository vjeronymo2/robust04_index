			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 22 Mar (TANJUG) -- Milan Martic, president  of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK], told Belgrade Radio's  Channel One this afternoon that the Serb side is not satisfied  with the course of today's negotiations in Zagreb and that the  Croatian side is trying to impose a solution by threat.    Martic said the RSK delegation in Zagreb has informed him  that the Croats are insisting on the disarming of the Serb  forces, which the Serb side "certainly cannot accept." He added  that the Serb delegation will stay at the talks despite this and  will use all possibilities to establish peace.    The Serbs went to the talks with the objective of bringing  the hostilities to an end and reaching an agreement on the RSK  territories which are occupied by Croatia.    "Whatever the developments, we cannot go below our our  minimum principle, the principle of self-determination. We have  our parliament, our government, the president. They were  legitimately elected in the latest elections. Our people  certainly cannot and will not allow our territory to be returned  to Croatia," Martic said.</p>

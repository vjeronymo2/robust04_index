			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FAA DROPS ANTI-NOISE PROPOSAL  </P> <P> The Federal Aviation Administration has abandoned a plan that would have  required pilots taking off from Los Angeles International Airport to wait until  they were a mile offshore before beginning to turn their aircraft.  </P> <P> In response to noise complaints from El Segundo residents, the agency announced  in February that air traffic controllers would tell pilots not to begin their  turns until they were a mile out over the ocean. Pilots have traditionally been  allowed to begin turning when they reach the shoreline.  </P> <P> After three days of testing in April, FAA officials decided that the new plan  would not work because it would force many pilots to violate a rule that  prohibits departing planes from flying too close together, according to Sabra  Kaulia, the FAA's assistant air traffic manager in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Air traffic regulations require pilots taking off from the airport's  southernmost runway -- the one closest to El Segundo -- to turn within two  miles after takeoff to ensure proper separation between their aircraft and  those taking off from a northern runway.  </P> <P> During the test, only 26% of more than 240 pilots were able to get their  aircraft turned within two miles. "This particular test did not work out,"  Kaulia said.  </P></p>

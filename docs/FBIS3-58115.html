He put on his coat, turned to one of his closest  aides, and revealed his good humor with a smile: "But politics  is no picnic..." No, the prime minister is not at all worried.  In the past 48 hours he has received approval and support from  the members of the former four-party alliance, but also from the  right and left -- even [Italian Social Movement, MSI, Secretary]  Fini said he is willing to accept this government until the  elections, as long as the elections take place as soon as  possible -- and now the 12 January parliamentary debate no  longer represents a trap for Ciampi.    When Scalfaro received the prime minister yesterday evening,  Ciampi conveyed to him his "satisfaction" with the outcome of  the consultations, a satisfaction based on the fact that the  parties' "differing positions" are brought together "by a lofty  sense of national responsibility." In other words, everyone  recognizes the dangers facing the country's economy and  international credibility; everyone is aware of how high the  stakes are. Strengthened by the support of the president, who  has recently discreetly discouraged all attempts to extend  artificially the life of the republic's 11th parliament until  June, Ciampi is preparing for next Wednesday [12 January] fairly  calmly, partly because it seems increasingly evident that it is  Scalfaro that will make the final decision to dissolve  parliament.    The request by the former four-way alliance parties to grant  parliament three months in which to reform the procedures for  modifying the Constitution, to grant Italians abroad the vote,  and to approve the [Justice Minister] Conso bill seems bound not  to be taken up. "They could have thought about it earlier,"  people at the Quirinale [president's office] are saying. There  is still a chance for another request -- to postpone the decree  dissolving parliament by a few weeks, at least until 30 January,  so as to hold the elections 10 April. The official reason --  repeated to Ciampi again yesterday by the SVP [South Tirol  People's Party] and the Ladostan Union -- is to permit the  approval of a number of laws, including the amendments to the  law on the European elections.    In fact this justification conceals two other plans -- one  "parliamentary," the other political. The former is the motive  for a group of some 100 deputies and senators who fear arrest if  they lose their parliamentary seats and who want to abolish  arrest for a number of offenses. The latter, shared by the DC  [Christian Democratic Party], [Fininvest President] Berlusconi,  and [Radical leader] Pannella, is to gain at least three weeks  in order to permit the proper establishment of the People's  Party, to grant the Rooting for Italy group more time to win  support, and to continue the gathering of signatures for  Pannella's and Bossi's referendum until the end of January.    The new factor emerging from these consultations is that the  League -- after suggesting that Scalfaro dissolve parliament  before the new constituencies were defined, and after announcing  the withdrawal of its representatives from parliament as an  extreme demand for an immediate election -- is now aiming no  longer at 20 March, realistically the earliest possible date,  but at 10 April, adding its own voice to those demanding that  Scalfaro defer signing the decree a little longer. The League's  Senate floor leader, Francesco Speroni, has issued a new threat  to the Quirinale ("unless the elections are held 10 April we  will return to parliament and engage in unprecedented  obstructionism") and [League ideologue] Miglio has again asked  Scalfaro to "honor what he said in Bologna," but neither has  asked the president to dissolve parliament right away. Now the  League would be satisfied with a dissolution at the end of the  month. Bossi's haste seems to have vanished into thin air; the  League's anxiety seems to have cooled inexplicably.    Carlo Azeglio Ciampi revealed to his interlocutors yesterday  that he will open the debate on the no-confidence motion with a  brief speech ("I will not speak for more than half an hour") and  that he wants to hear what all the floor leaders have to say  before reaching any decision. According to Rete floor leader  Diego Novelli, "the prime minister ruled out absolutely  categorically both a reshuffle and a government crisis steered  toward a second term."    So it is possible that, after listening to the various  parties' positions, the prime minister will tender his  resignation to the president and initiate the procedures for  dissolving parliament. "You must not await the elections," the  Greens advised him.    After talking with Ciampi, SVP Alto-Adige Deputy Roland Riz,  told journalists that he felt that the government "is inclined  to hold an election before the European elections." This is  nothing new. But then Riz added: "How long before, I do not  know. Maybe a week." However, this suggestion was flatly denied  by Chigi Palace.    Evidently with none of his interlocutors did Ciampi venture  to forecast the election date, though it is no secret that the  Chigi Palace now regards only the four dates between 20 March  and 10 April as realistic. [Rete Secretary] Orlando, Fini, and  Cossutta told Ciampi that they prefer the earliest feasible  date, namely 20 March, and Novelli went through the calendar  with him to show that it is impossible to go beyond that date  without risking further parliamentary traps. "There are people  in the lower house," he told him, "that live with the fear of  going to prison once they leave there, and they would be willing  even to start a war with San Marino just to extend this  parliament." The prime minister smiled, but made no comment on  the observation.</p>

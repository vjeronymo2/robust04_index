The United States filed a civil action against Olin Corporation, seeking injunctive relief and civil penalties for violations of section 112(c) of the Clean Air Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 7412(c), the National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants for mercury promulgated under the Act (the ``mercury NESHAP''), 40 CFR part 61, Subparts A and E, and Section 103(a) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, (``CERCLA''), 42 U.S.C. 9603(a), and 40 CFR 302.6 promulgated under CERCLA. The action was originally filed in November 1991. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Defendant Olin Corporation (``Olin'') owns and operates a plant in Charleston, Tennessee, where it uses mercury chlor-alkali cells to manufacture chlorine and other products, Olin's mercury chlor-alkali cell process includes over 400 feet of piping referred to as the ``dilute caustic header.'' The dilute caustic header pipe is an ``alkali metal hydroxide line'' within the meaning of the mercury NESHAP. Mercury, as well as other substances, flow through this piping. The United States alleged that Olin Corporation violated the mercury NESHAP by failing to maintain the header pipe and the cell room basement floor in good condition. The United States also alleged, among other things, that on or about August 22, 1988, Olin violated the mercury NESHAP by allowing the use of torches to cut through the header pipe to remove and replace it, by allowing mercury to spill from the header pipe, by failing to ensure that exposed employees were decontaminated, and by otherwise failing to ensure that the spills were properly contained or cleaned up. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed consent decree, Olin Corporation will pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000 to the United States in settlement of these claims as well as other claims relating to the incident on August 22, 1988. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department of Justice will receive, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication comments relating to the proposed consent decree.

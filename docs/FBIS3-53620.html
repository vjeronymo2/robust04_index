			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Tehran Voice of the Islamic Republic of  Iran First Program Network in Persian at 1600 GMT on 17 January  carries in its "World of Politics" program a recorded interview  with Mohammad Mahdavi, Foreign Ministry director general for  Africa, on relations with South Africa.    In reply to a question as to what led Iran to decide to  establish ties with South Africa, Mahdavi says: "It should noted  that diplomatic ties have not been established with South  Africa. After the elections in April 1994, when the deprived  and suffering people of South Africa have attained their rights  and taken over the management of the country, we will, God  willing, establish diplomatic ties with South Africa. But what  was recently approved in the country and brought to the  attention of the people was the lifting of the restrictions we  had on our economic ties with South Africa."    Mahdavi then comments on the events leading to the  forthcoming free elections and abrogation of apartheid in South  Africa.    On the reason for Iran's decision, he says: "What led us to  decide to establish economic ties with South Africa was, first,  the recent events in South Africa and, second, the direct  request of the combative groups in South Africa, who wrote to us  and asked us to lift the restrictions on trade with South  Africa. However, we have deferred the establishment of  diplomatic ties, which will be the main basis of relations  between our country and South Africa, until after the elections,  when every black person has attained his rights there."    Asked about Western media propaganda about Iran's u-turn in  its policy on Israel and South Africa, Mahdavi says: "They,  themselves, know that they are not being truthful and that what  they are saying is not correct. We have declared our stance on  these two from the start. About South Africa, we said that when  racism is abolished there and the oppressed and innocent people  of South Africa take over power -- on the basis of one man one  vote -- we would establish diplomatic and economic ties with  that country. And we are moving in that direction now.  However, our stance on the Zionist regime has been clear from  the start. His holiness the imam said that the Zionist regime  must be destroyed. Yes, when the Zionist regime is destroyed  and the people of Palestine take over power, our relations with  the people of Palestine -- which is now occupied, but will then  be free -- will be established."</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Funding boost for higher education ADDITIONAL teaching funds will be provided next year to English universities to attract more part-time students and encourage growth in science, engineering and technology, John Willman writes. Details published yesterday of the allocation of the Pounds 2.3bn budget of the Higher Education Funding Council for Englandfor 1993-94 show that Pounds 45m will be provided to fund additional places meeting these priorities. There will also be a big rise in funding for research, with the former polytechnics receiving a five-fold increase on their transition to university status. This is the first time government funding for higher education has been distributed by the new council, which replaced the separate university, polytechnic and college funding councils. In spite of a cap on the student intake next year, this will mean less cash to teach each student, according to the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, because total student numbers continue to rise as former years of expansion roll through the system.</p>

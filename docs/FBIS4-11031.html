			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 19 Apr (NA) -- The Chilean national  defense chief of staff, Vice Admiral Jorge Patricio Arancibia  Reyes, stated today in this capital that Chile will continue to  purchase armaments because "the technological level that has  been acquired, which is related to the level of a country's  development, cannot be neglected."    "A country must have the armed forces it is capable of  maintaining, both technologically and financially, in a close  relationship between security and development," Arancibia Reyes  said.    Notwithstanding, the admiral denied that Chile is embarked  on  an arms race, and said "materiel only has been renewed" in  recent times.    Asked about the appearance of insurgent groups in several  parts of the continent, such as the group that revolted in  Chiapas, Mexico, he maintained that today "they have an  international structure behind them that keeps their concern  about these movements on the alert." [quote as received]    The Chilean Army chief [title as received], who is visiting  the country on an official visit, today met Argentine Defense  Minister Oscar Camilion.    During the meeting, in which the Argentine joint chief of  staff, Lieutenant General Mario Candido Diaz, participated, the  Chilean officer handed a letter to Camilion from Chilean Defense  Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma, who proposed a meeting between the  two ministers some time this year.    Regarding the Mapuche conflict that has emerged in his  country, Arancibia Reyes stressed that "a solution is in the  works," and that "the concerns expressed by the Mapuches are  being well channeled."    Finally, Arancibia Reyes highlighted "the greatness of the  Argentine Armed Forces" within the Latin American context.</p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / UK Company News: European Acquisition Capital in Pounds 33m purchase European Acquisition Capital, a specialist corporate equity investor, yesterday announced the purchase of Stalwart Assurance Group in a Pounds 33m deal. Stalwart is a small life insurance company which sells a specialist annuity home income plan, under which elderly homeowners receive a monthly lifetime income in exchange for the sale of a 'reversionary' interest in their property. Policyholders continue to live in the property for life. EAC will invest Pounds 12.8m, including acquisition and cancellation of Pounds 7.9m of loan notes and a working capital injection of Pounds 2.4m. Existing and new debt facilities total Pounds 20m. Stalwart's executive team will retain their shareholdings. Stalwart was previously owned by a consortium of venture capitalists. EAC said yesterday that Stalwart's growth had become constrained because of a shortage of funds from traditional sources, falling house prices and the knock-on effect of an adverse reaction in the market to unsuitable home income products. EAC has been able to obtain substantial sources of reinsurance funding for Stalwart, which has a portfolio worth about Pounds 69m, represented by some 1,100 properties.</p>

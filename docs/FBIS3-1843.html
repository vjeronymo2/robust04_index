			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 2 KYODO -- China is very unlikely to  grant the International Red Cross Society (ICRC) access to its  jails in the foreseeable future despite the recent start of  official negotiations on the issue, a high-ranking ICRC official  said Wednesday [2 March].    "ICRC has been talking to the Chinese Government on the  question of access to prisoners for a number of years now.  There's nothing new there," Jean-Michel Monod, the ICRC's  delegate-general for Asia and the Pacific, told reporters.    Monod, who has been participating in these talks, said,  however, that the position of Red Cross negotiators has improved  since Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen last November 9  officially invited the Red Cross for talks.    Prior to Qian's announcement, China had always denounced  such  requests as tantamount to interfering in the internal affairs of  a sovereign state.    The announcement came shortly before a U.S.-China summit  which was expected to focus on human rights issues, including  access to political prisoners, a demand the U.S. had raised  repeatedly hoping visits would reduce torture and other abuses.    "I do not wish that these negotiations are perceived  exclusively in the framework of the U.S.-China relationship over  MFN (most- favored nation status)," Monod said, adding that  access to political prisoners is a longstanding, traditional Red  Cross concern beyond all national interests.    U.S. President Bill Clinton has warned that he will not  extend preferential trade treatment when MFN comes up for  renewal in June unless China improves up its poor human rights  record.    The Red Cross has checked jails in over 50 countries and  will  not modify its conditions for visits to Chinese prisons, Monod  said.    Concerning the talks in Beijing in mid-January, it is far  too  early to speak about a "half access or a quarter opening or a  tenth of a promise," he said, predicting it will be a "long  process" until China accepts the idea of a neutral humanitarian  organization entering its prisons in order to protect the  detainees' rights.    Meanwhile, the Red Cross has spelled out its terms for the  visits, "the same conditions as for any other country," which  will be discussed in a number of more technical follow-ups  focusing on the wording and legal problems, Monod said.    Once a government gives the green light for prison checks  the  Red Cross insists on free access to all prisoners of a  previously defined category.    Prisoners may not be transferred from their actual place of  detention, must be allowed to talk in private, and be guaranteed  continued contact with Red Cross personnel.    Given that negotiations are still in their infancy and that  defining the content of an ICRC visit or the category of  prisoners is already "really difficult," Monod warned against  high hopes for a quick solution to the issue.    "We will try to solve all the issues step by step," he said,  adding that it is anybody's guess when the first prison visit  would be realized.</p>

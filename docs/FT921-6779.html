			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Survey of European finance and investment, Overview (8): Bond markets still buoyant - A change in the pattern of corporate funding THERE was a marked change in the pattern of corporate funding in Europe last year as companies moved away from large syndicated bank facilities, favouring instead simple funding raised from investment institutions and simple bilateral bank loans. Only Dollars 94.4bn was raised in the European syndicated loans market last year, down from Dollars 163.3bn in 1990. In part this reflects a fall in demand for bank finance as many western European economies moved into recession. As a provider of stand-by lines of credit, for example, the syndicated banking market is the natural source of acquisition finance. As acquisition activity has fallen away, so the number of companies seeking bid finance has decreased. But the decline in syndicated lending also stems from pressure on banks themselves to rebuild margins following the excesses of the 1980s. This has increased the cost of bank finance, leading companies to examine other alternatives. Some correction in pricing was undoubtedly due. At the peak of the 'borrowers' market' in the late 1980s, banks were fighting each other to participate in blue-chip corporate loans. Margins fell to an impossibly fine level. In 1987, BTR, the UK industrial group, secured Pounds 1bn 5-year committed funding at a margin of 7.5 basis points over the London interbank offered rate. The margin on similar transactions has since at least doubled, with fees rising by a similar proportion. While the number of syndicated credits has fallen sharply, the bond markets have remained a ready source of finance for large European corporations. In the international bond market alone, companies, governments and supranational agencies raised Dollars 230bn last year, up from Dollars 161bn in 1990 and Dollars 210bn in 1989 - the previous record. Like the weakness of the loans market, the buoyancy of bond markets is partly due to cyclical factors: as interest rates have declined in many economies, investors have been switching funds into bond market investments. While the cost of bank finance has risen, yield spreads in the bond market have fallen to attractive levels. However, the cyclical buoyancy of bond markets also overlays a longer-term switch by companies in favour of funding provided by investment institutions such as insurance companies and pension funds. Problems experienced by large companies, such as News Corporation, in re-structuring complex banking facilities has underlined that over-reliance on a single source of finance can be dangerous. The diversification of funding is being pursued by corporate treasurers across Europe. However, only the biggest companies can tap the public Eurobond market. Bond issues usually have to be of a certain size and liquidity - around Dollars 150m equivalent - to attract investors. One of the biggest challenges for corporate financiers has been to find a way for smaller companies to tap investment institutions for debt finance. An increasing number of European companies are raising debt finance in the US, placing 'tailored' debt securities with institutional investors. The size of US debt placements has grown: large European companies, such as Allied Lyons, have raised Dollars 400m from a single placement of bonds. The potential of the market for European companies is huge. Of the Dollars 160bn new paper placed last year, foreign companies accounted for just 5 per cent. UK companies have been most active, not least because UK accounting conventions are at least adjacent to US rules. However, following aggressive marketing by US banks keen to drum up business, companies from France, Holland and Germany are not far behind. Those UK companies which have tapped the market - such as Pilkington and NFC  -often use the proceeds to repay bank debt. In an environment where bank credit is seen as more restricted and less reliable than in the past, institutional funding has a utility over and above its competitiveness in terms of cost. Within Europe, the private placement market has been largely replaced by the use of medium-term notes. An MTN programme allows companies to issue bonds, usually of between one year and 30 years' maturity, under a single legal framework, placing securities denominated in a range of currencies as pockets of demand are identified. As in a commercial paper programme, liquidity is provided by a number of dealing banks tied to the programme. New European medium-term note programmes set up last year amounted to Dollars 42bn, up from Dollars 31bn in 1990. It remains to be seen whether European investment institutions will continue to embrace the MTN market with any enthusiasm. While MTNs offer investors a supply of assets tailored to match specific balance sheet requirements, the perceived illiquidity of the instruments has always been seen as a drawback. These factors mean that most corporations, even the largest, remain reliant on bank facilities to manage short-term liquidity. But styles of bank borrowing have changed. Bilateral loans are replacing complex, syndicated multiple-option facilities. A more diffuse pattern of funding is now seen as a prudent response to the retrenchment of banks. BP, the UK-based oil company which is seen as a bellwether of corporate treasury activity, last year replaced syndicated bank facilities with a series of bilateral loans, dramatically reducing the number of banks with which it deals. Other companies are following the same pattern. Corporate treasurers note that there is an inherent refunding risk in having Pounds 1bn bank finance falling due on one day. In addition, the largest companies realise that they have greatest leverage over lenders when business is concentrated with just a few key institutions. More bank lenders does not necessarily mean less risk.</p>

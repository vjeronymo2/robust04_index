			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHALLENGE TO ABORTION FUNDING LAW DISMISSED  </P> <P> A judge on Friday dismissed a teen-age gang-rape victim's challenge to  Michigan's voter-approved law cutting off state-funded abortions for poor  women.  </P> <P> Wayne County Circuit Judge John H. Hausner ruled the law bars an abortion for  the girl, since her life is not endangered by the pregnancy. He said the law  does not violate Michigan's Constitution.  </P> <P> The American Civil Liberties Union brought the suit on behalf of the girl, and  its lawyers promised to appeal. The girl, now about nine weeks pregnant, has  been offered money for a private abortion.  </P></p>

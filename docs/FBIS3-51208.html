			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani </F> with foreign and domestic correspondents and an unidentified  moderator at the Central American Villa where the Fifth Central  American Games athletes will be lodged; broadcast in progress --  live relay]    [Excerpt] [Unidentified reporter] ...if the government does  not give them a salary increase they may go on strike.    [Cristiani] The Fifth Central American Games have already  begun. We believe it is quite clear that sports can serve as an  example of Central American brotherhood and what characteristics  all good citizens require. Obviously, as Salvadorans, we hope  our team wins the upcoming games. We, however, will be  satisfied if all participants do their best.    Once a year we review salary policies, and this is being  studied right now, as it has been done in previous years. I  really cannot see how they [public workers] can justify asking  for salary increases after just three months since their last  increase, or how they can then threaten to go on strike if no  increases are granted. I believe this is mainly politically  motivated. I believe public workers should trust the fact that  every year salary policies have been reviewed, and this will  also be the case this year. Nevertheless, we do not yield to  these sort of pressures -- politically motivated pressures. I  repeat, I do not think that this is proper just three months  since the last increase.    [Moderator] Mario Jovel from the "Up to Date" newscast [San  Salvador Canal Doce Television].    [Jovel] Mr. President, yesterday Onusal [UN Observers for El  Salvador] Director Dr. Augusto Ramirez Ocampo said that there  were delays in the peace accords regarding land transfers and  the reinsertion of former fighters into civilian life. What are  the problems or difficulties, and might they not cause some sort  of conflict?    [Cristiani] No, they definitely cannot create any sort of  conflict. Although there might be delays, these are not new  delays but a delay that has existed right from the start. You  may have heard all of the reasons for the delays in implementing  certain programs, but we are expediting things as much as  possible. I believe Dr. Ramirez Ocampo said that although there  are delays, the process continues to move ahead. This does not  necessarily mean there are problems.    [Moderator] Carlos Dominquez, Megavision.    [Dominguez] Good morning, Mr. President. I have two  questions. The first one: Yesterday we heard statements by the  Ombudsman for Human Rights, as a member of the special  commission investigating the illegal armed groups, when he  mentioned certain delays to get organized. We would like to  first hear your views on what the government is able to do for  this commission to begin its work.    [Cristiani] We have said this commission is autonomous and  that any delays are not the fault of the government, and we have  not received any requests. We have clearly stated that we will  help with anything the Joint Commission requests from the  government, provided it is within our means. We have no  influence whatsoever with what happens within the Joint  Commission, and, therefore, this is their business. What the  ombudsman should do is try to expedite things within the  commission. It is not that the government is delaying things;  we are keeping our hands out of it. Whatever they do is up to  them. They may request something, but, I repeat, nothing has  been asked of us up to now.    [Dominguez] Thank you, Mr. President. The other question is:  we want to have your official confirmation on what is being  unofficially mentioned or rumored regarding the alleged arrest  of four Salvadorans in the clashes in Chiapas State, Mexico.    [Cristiani] We have not received any official report; these  are press reports. The Mexican Government has not officially  reported about them.    [Moderator] Jaime Atencio, Cadena Sonora.    [Atencio] Good morning, Mr. President. My question is this:  This morning National Civilian Police [PNC] representatives in  La Union reported the presence of Honduran troops in the village  of Poloros. What is the government doing about it? Does the  government know about this?    [Cristiani] We have permanent contact with the Honduran  Government through our Foreign Ministry, and the first thing one  does in these cases is to investigate to see what the facts are  and then try and resolve it somehow through diplomatic channels.  We believe this is the way to resolve these problems and not  allow this to become a bigger problem. It is the Foreign  Ministry that resolves these problems.    [Moderator] William Hernandez from LA PRENSA GRAFICA.    [Hernandez] Do you have confirmed reports on these troops?    [Cristiani] We have received reports from citizens. I, at  least, have not received an official report from the PNC on  recent cases or, rather, cases from yesterday. Prior to that,  we had received reports from Salvadorans who have said that  there have been Honduran troops in what is considered Salvadoran  territory. Part of the problem is that many of the people do  not really know where the border lies following The Hague  ruling. Sometimes this may lead to confusion or to the belief  that something is in our territory when in fact it is not so.  In turn, it is necessary to open an investigation. Of course,  it is clear that Poloros is Salvadoran, and this will have to be  fully investigated and worked out through the Foreign Ministry.    [Moderator] William Hernandez of LA PRENSA GRAFICA [as  heard].    [?Hernandez] Good morning, Mr. President. I would like you  to confirm the PNC deployment scheduled for next week. There  have been rumors that it will be in Mejicanos and Ayutuxtepeque.    [Cristiani] No, the next deployment will be in Nueva San  Salvador and Antiguo Cuscatlan municipalities. I understand the  PNC graduation will be on 21 January and the deployment will be  a few days later.    [Moderator] Wilber Gomez of "The Newscast."    [Gomez] Mr. President, regarding the PNC deployment  throughout San Salvador, how many will there be? Where will  the San Salvador National Police be deployed?    [Cristiani] We believe 340 will graduate from the PNC  academy. We have no way of know how many may fail, but the final  number is somewhere around 340. We understand there are  approximately 40 additional PNC members who fell behind in some  subjects and others who will be ready for this deployment. In  other words, we are aiming to have about 400 PNC members for  those two municipalities. The remaining will be deployed in the  rest of the metropolitan area that remains under National Police  responsibility.    [Gomez] But where will the National Police from these areas  be deployed?    [Cristiani] To the remaining municipalities in the San  Salvadors metropolitan area. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RALLY COMMEMORATES BIRTHDAY OF SLAIN BLACK NATIONALIST LEADER MALCOLM X  </P> <P> More than 1,000 people gathered Saturday at a Southwest Los Angeles park to  commemorate the 65th birthday of slain black leader Malcolm X, organizers said.  </P> <P> The rally, organized by the African-American National Malcolm X Commemorative  Committee, was held "to let people know we have not forgotten his striving" and  to press legislators to declare the leader's birthday a holiday, organizer  Brian Breye said.  </P> <P> Bands played and speakers such as poet Sonya Sanchez and civil rights activist  Marcus Garvey Jr. invoked the memory of Malcolm X, a member of the Nation of  Islam and leader in the black nationalist movement who was killed in 1965.  </P> <P> Malcolm X overcame a prison record acquired in his teens to become a leader in  the 1960s of the burgeoning Nation of Islam, a black American religious sect.  He was shot to death in February, 1965, a short time after he publicly broke  with Nation of Islam leadership over its strident anti-white message.  </P></p>

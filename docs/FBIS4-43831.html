			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed interview with Christian Democratic Center </F> leader Pierferdinando Casini in Rome; date not given: "Single  Party Is the Inevitable Choice" -- first paragraph is LA  REPUBBLICA introduction]    [Text] Rome -- "Yes, I believe that we shall be able to  call it the Freedom Party. Something is already happening in  the south: We have there sections of the Freedom Alliance  consisting of Forza Italia, the National Alliance [AN], and us,  the CCD [Christian Democratic Center]. Another small step, and  we are there. Together with [Interior Minister] Maroni and  [Defense Minister] Previti, CCD leader Pierferdinando Casini is  one of the most convinced supporters of the need to merge the  various center-right forces into a `single party.'"    [LA REPUBBLICA] You are insisting heavily, but the  resistance  -- in particular from the League -- is strong. Do you believe  that the project will come about in the end?    [Casini] I would answer like this: If it does not come  about, the Freedom Alliance will never really get off the  ground. We are halfway there. We must decide whether to remain  with the ambiguity of an electoral system which is no longer  proportional but not yet totally majority-based, or to take the  remaining step. And it is clear that a decision to move ahead  has to mean uniting the forces of the alignment, on the one  hand, and of the Left on the other, into single groupings.    [LA REPUBBLICA] You could also not take that step.    [Casini] Here the reply is even simpler: The way to a new  electoral system with a single ballot and without any recovery  through the proportional system is either via a vote in  parliament with the agreement of the Left, or a referendum. I  believe that the process needs to be put into motion rapidly, in  time for the next regional elections, which ought to go hand in  hand with the direct election of the president and a pure  single-member system.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Who is for and who is against the "single  party" within the Freedom Alliance?    [Casini] The discussion is very open. [AN leader] Fini is  already dealing with the process as it relates to his AN.  Within Forza Italia, on the other hand, two lines exist side by  side.    [LA REPUBBLICA] How?    [Casini] Some people are trying to formalize an assumed  hegemony. I am saying only: Let's calculate, because Forza  Italia's 30 percent is more the outcome of emotion than a solid  consensus. And then let us look at the preference votes in the  European elections: Berlusconi gets 600,000 votes, the next man  50,000.    [LA REPUBBLICA] And the League. [League Secretary] Bossi  does not want to hear of a "single party."    [Casini] Bossi many times says the right things. But in this  case his reasoning is shortsighted. Like that of my PPI  [Italian Popular Party] friends, moreover. We are discussing a  two-party system and they do not yet accept the concept of  bipolarity.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On August 2, 1993, the Technology Administration published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (55 FR 41069). In response to this notice forty-four letters were received; twenty-nine from universities, ten from other not-for-profit research organizations and industry associations, one from a state agency, one from a U.S.-owned for-profit company, one from a U.S. subsidiary of a foreign-owned corporation, one from a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, and one from a member of the NIST staff. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All but four of the forty-four respondents, including all twenty-nine from universities and all ten from other not-for-profit organizations, commented on the proposed revision to the treatment of patent rights found in &sect;295.8. An additional two dozen comments were received concerning proposed changes to the proposed definitions set out in &sect;295.2. The remaining comments were scattered among several sections, including: five concerning new &sect;295.14, which deals with special financial reporting requirements; three on the revisions to the selection criteria found in &sect;295.5; two on the use of abbreviated proposals proposed in &sect;295.5; and one each on the provisions on the eligibility and qualification of applicants found in &sect;&sect;295.3 and 295.31. No comments were received in response to proposed changes to the following: &sect;295.1, pertaining to the purpose of the regulation; &sect;295.4, the selection process; &sect;295.7, pertaining to notices of availability of funds; &sect;295.21, on qualification of applicants; &sect;295.22, dealing with limitations on assistance; &sect;295.24, concerning registration under the antitrust laws; and &sect;295.30, which describes the types of assistance available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following is a section-by-section description of the comments received by NIST, and NIST's response to those comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 295.2&blank;Definitions_Comment Summary (24 Comments) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Twenty-three respondents, all universities or other nonprofit organizations, questioned whether the definition of ``United States-owned company'' found in &sect;295.2(r) of the proposed rule reflected the actual intent of Congress as stated in the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991. The definition of United States-owned company set out in &sect;295.2(r) is used in section 295.8 to determine eligibility to obtain title to inventions arising from assistance under ATP. A consolidated analysis of the issues raised by &sect;295.2(r) and 295.8 is presented in the discussion of &sect;295.8 later in this notice, and the reader is asked to refer to that discussion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the issue described above, one respondent questioned the exclusion (by omission) of independent research and development (IR&amp;D) costs in the definition of matching funds found in &sect;295.2(1). IR&amp;D funds are generally generated through contracts funded by the federal government. The financial assistance regulations which are applicable to ATP awards, and particularly Attachment E to OMB Circular A&hyph;110, prohibit the use of federal funds as cost share or match unless specifically authorized by federal law. The rule follows closely the wording of the 1988 legislation and hence cannot be changed without congressional action. The purpose of the limitations on qualified matching funds is to obtain a meaningful and significant commitment of company resources towards ATP objectives, including support to additional R&amp;D beyond that which would have occurred without the ATP award. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 295.3&blank;Eligibility of United States and foreign-owned businesses_(1 Comment) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One U.S. subsidiary of a foreign-owned company requested that both eligibility requirements and cancellation requirements for foreign-owned applicants be made clearer and that they be consistent with present law and with H.R. 820. In response, NIST notes that H.R. 820 is not law, but rather is pending legislation in the Congress. NIST cannot base changes in rules upon proposed legislation that has not been enacted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 295.5&blank;Use of Abbreviated Proposals in the Selection Process_(2 Comments) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two respondents endorsed the use of abbreviated proposals. One respondent further proposed that abbreviated proposals address, and thus be evaluated on, scientific and technical criteria only. NIST has determined that business and economic factors are important factors in assessing the potential for success of a proposed project, and therefore must be considered in addition to the scientific and technical merit of the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 295.6&blank;Criteria for Selection_(3 Comments) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two respondents endorsed the increased emphasis on ``scientific and technical merit'', one of whom suggested increasing its weight further to 40 percent. Another respondent took issue with the reduced weight for two proposers ``level of commitment'' and suggested increasing the weight for the ``commitment'' criteria to 30 percent by eliminating ``experience and qualifications'' as a separate criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

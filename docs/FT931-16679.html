			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Gloom behind the cocktail chatter - Devaluation has masked the problems facing British farmers THE CHRISTMAS cocktail circuit in which the farming industry indulges is a little different to that in suburbia. Much of it takes place in association with rural pursuits such as pheasant shoots and fox hunts. I will not enter the debate about the ethics or the need for such activities but will suggest that enthusiasm for them among farm folk is as much to do with the opportunities they provide for getting together and talking shop in a relaxed atmosphere as for the kill or the chase. In that respect their function is similar to urban drinks parties. Chatter over mulled wine, whisky macks and rusty nails during the recent festive season has been, perhaps surprisingly, moderately bullish. Last year saw the beginning of a fundamental reform of the system of European Community agricultural support that will cut commodity prices substantially over the next three years, as well as the most difficult autumn for decades. But it also embraced a devaluation of the pound that, in the short term at least, led to increases in those same commodity prices, producing windfall returns. Reform of the EC's common agricultural policy and the introduction of virtually compulsory set-aside was undoubtedly was the biggest shock in 1992. Reared in the tradition that progress is synonymous with increased production, most farmers abhor the prospect of leaving 15 per cent of their land uncropped. A few say, even now, that they will forgo the compensation that those who take the statutory proportion of their land out of production are entitled to, and attempt to survive at the reduced guaranteed prices imposed by the EC's council of agriculture ministers. The majority, however, myself included, will bow to the will of the politicians and leave part of our land to grow weeds. The fact that the compensation for so doing has been initially set at what are widely recognised as fair figures and that these too will be raised, in the UK, by the devaluation of the pound, is clearly significant to our decision. It is something of a paradox that a reform package advertised as being intended to bring agriculture closer to real market forces has had the effect of stimulating every farmer to calculate the mix of cropping and set-aside most likely to provide the biggest income. In the great majority of cases this has resulted in a decision to farm for the maximum subsidy more than most have ever done before. The political culture shock was followed by another of an extended meteorological nature. Half way through the grain harvest of 1992 it began to rain. At first it was welcomed as a break in the near four-year drought and a boost to depleted water reserves. But it continued until the end of the year - causing untold damage to soil structure as well as the loss of thousands of acres of potatoes and sugar beet. The rains also had made it impossible to plant between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of the autumn grain intended for harvesting next August and led to poor establishment of much that was planted. The costs of that wet weather will not be felt until later this year and perhaps beyond. They will take the form of a severely reduced UK harvest next summer and massive expenditure on cultivations as farmers attempt to repair soil structure by draining and sub-soiling. That is something to contemplate in the future, however. Most of the talk over Christmas was of the high prices farmers had made on the grain they gathered from last harvest; of the savings they had made as a result of lower bank interest rates or overdrafts; and of the reintroduction of capital allowances in the chancellor's autumn statement, which would help them re-tool with much needed equipment instead of paying tax on the unexpected profits. Much of the relief they felt arose from the fact that they found themselves at the end of what could have been a horrendous year, in many ways, better off than they had feared. Their delight, in other words, was somewhat Micawberish in that they now expected to make a small profit instead of a small loss. I was left with the impression that many also followed the Dickens character in their hopes for the future in the perhaps naive belief that, as with the 1992 devaluation 'something will turn up'. I hope those who think that way are right. But there is nothing on the immediate horizon to suggest that prospects have really improved. Moreover, what can be foreseen indicates that the les welcome effects of sterling's devaluation story will soon start to bite on farmers - if it has not already. UK farmers import a great many of their livestock and crop production requisites from countries that have not devalued their currencies. These inputs are now having to be paid for in greatly depreciated pounds. The British government and the European Commission have, anyway, by restricting the green currency system used for intra-community trade, effectively deprived UK farmers of the full benefits that might have been derived from the sterling devaluation. So the foreign exchange bonus enjoyed by arable farmers has proved to be very limited. Levels of compensation for not producing - for setting aside land - are another issue. It has always been made clear that the scheme was transitional in nature, aimed mainly at cushioning farmers as they adjusted to the reality of world market prices. UK farmers also fear that they face the inevitable antipathy of taxpayers when they become fully aware that their cash is paying for farmers not to grow food. Public opinion may decree, the farming commu ity believes, that compensation should be, at the very least, significantly reduced. Over the predicament of the UK farmers there hangs the unfinished business of the negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. They have been assured by politicians from Mr John Major, prime minister, downards that the compromise reached by the EC with the US late last year and any agreement concluded in the Gatt forum would able to be accommodated within the measures already taken to reform the CAP. Few British agriculturists who have done the calculations believe that this is possible. Some even predict that successful conclusion of the protracted Gatt negotiations could lead to more than double the present area of British farm land being set aside, without any guarantee of compensation. Previous challenges to UK farm profitability have normally been satisfied by increases in production. Now, since the introductiuon of set-aside, that is no longer an option. About the only thing that may 'turn up' to save the situation is a food shortage. With world stocks of some key commodities still at relatively critical levels that prospect may not be as far fetched as it might seem.</p>

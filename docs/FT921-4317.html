			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour to highlight NHS after Budget - Health LABOUR yesterday tried to pre-empt today's Budget by spelling out a stark 'choice' between cuts in income tax and specific examples of alternative uses for the revenue in improved public services. Labour is determined to keep the NHS at the centre of the election campaign as debate about the Budget starts today. Mr Robin Cook, the shadow health secretary, outlined just six measures that could be taken to boost the National Health Service for less than Pounds 100m, or a twentieth of the value of lost revenues if the basic rate of income tax was reduced by 1p. Among the examples were a freeze in prescription charges, due to increase next month, an additional 1,000 nurses, 230 posts for cancer treatment and 150 new cardiac specialists. 'The choice must be to build better services for the public rather than to buy re-election for themselves,' Mr Cook said. His attack was swiftly rebutted by the Tories. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health minister, charged that Labour's policies would 'drain nearly Pounds 1bn from direct health-care services - and very largely it would be the unions who won out.' She backed her claim with figures arguing that the national minimum wage plan would cost the NHS Pounds 500m, while the abolition of charges would divert a further Pounds 365m away from direct patient care. Adding that NHS spending had risen by 55 per cent above inflation in the last 13 years, Mrs Bottomley claimed that planned government spending would add a further boost of Pounds 2.7bn. In spite of a new determination by the Tories to tackle Labour's NHS attacks head on, opposition strategists believe their polling shows clearly that it remains a 'winning' issue. In a separate move, Mr Cook yesterday repeated his argument that Mr William Waldegrave, the health secretary, had inflated his claims of the number of acute in-patients expected to be treated by the NHS this year by at least 500,000.</p>

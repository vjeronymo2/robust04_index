			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Herculean task for UK defenders: The US-European contest to supply the RAF's new generation of transport aircraft Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence secretary, is to make one of his most painful public announcements next month when he outlines to parliament the latest series of cuts in the armed forces. The ministry's review of defence spending, code-named Front-Line First, will probably conclude that bases should be closed, services privatised, and about 20,000 jobs lost, many from RAF support staff. To sweeten the pill Mr Rifkind can announce some new military equipment orders. The Army may get up to 250 Challenger II tanks, the Navy its latest batch of three Type 23 frigates and the Royal Air Force a substantial updating of its Tornado aircraft. But the result of one procurement decision is unlikely to be welcomed by all sides of the UK defence industry. The race to replace half of the RAF's ageing fleet of 60 Hercules transport aircraft is being run between US and European competitors. Both sides have British partners, both badly want to win. Lockheed, the US manufacturer of the Hercules, is vying with a European group, which will operate under the aegis of the Airbus consortium and includes British Aerospace, to supply the new generation of transport aircraft. Lockheed says it can provide the RAF with a first batch of 30 of the latest generation of Hercules, called the C130J, at an attractive price. Starting in 1996 the C130J will be available 'off-the-shelf'. Lockheed says it will have none of the unexpected development costs and uncertainties which often dog new aircraft. British engineering companies such as Dowty and Lucas have won 12 per cent of the work on the C130J in open competition against US competitors. According to General Al Hansen, vice-president of Lockheed's air transport programmes: 'The C130J is worth Pounds 2.2bn to British industry and will secure 3,500 jobs in the UK if we sell 700 aircraft worldwide. Because the RAF is a world-class air force we regard it as very important to secure them as a launch customer for this new generation of Hercules.' Lockheed is trying to make it worthwhile for the RAF to order the C130J. It has offered a discount of about 10 per cent of the Pounds 750m-Pounds 850m cost of the first 30 aircraft if the RAF is the launch customer. In an unprecedented move, it will take the RAF's old aircraft in part-exchange, provided they can still fly. While the deal is financially attractive to the RAF, it is not critical to UK participation in the C130J worldwide. Mr Frank Turner, the managing director of Lucas Aerospace, says: 'We support the C130J to replace the Hercules. But Lucas was chosen by Lockheed, regardless of UK interest, as the global leader in our field, and we expect to keep our share of the work whatever the UK decides.' British Aerospace acknowledges that its own contender, rather prosaically called the Future Large Aircraft, will not be available until at least 2000. The development costs of the FLA, estimated by BAe at more than Pounds 2bn for the consortium as a whole and Pounds 500m for the UK, will also need to be met by the purchasing governments. BAe argues that the FLA will be bigger, faster and more flexible than the C130J. It will be able to transport helicopters, armoured personnel carriers and field guns which the Lockheed aircraft is too small to handle. And while each FLA will cost between Pounds 40m and Pounds 45m (including development costs) compared with Pounds 25m for the C130J, its increased capacity, flexibility and advanced technology will make the total lifetime costs of its fleet lower than Lockheed's equivalent. Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, says: 'The FLA would bring work to the UK worth between Pounds 5.5bn and Pounds 12bn and secure 7,500 aerospace jobs at the peak of production.' The argument over which aircraft the MoD should choose goes wider than the technical merits of the two transporters. Mr Evans insists that the aircraft's importance to the UK aerospace industry means that 'this decision is just too important to be left to the Ministry of Defence'. BAe says that if the government opts for the US aircraft, Britain will be forced to withdraw from the FLA programme altogether. This is because the share of work allocated on European collaborative programmes has depended traditionally on how many aircraft each country decides to buy. Between 250 and 300 FLA are expected to be ordered by the consortium's European partners. But if the UK replaces the first half of its Hercules fleet with the C130J, it will not need the 50 FLA which would ensure Britain a 20 per cent stake in the project. Decisions are to be made next year on how many FLA each European partner wants. In continental Europe, enthusiasm seems to be running high. Both President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl stressed their commitment to the FLA at the recent Franco-German summit. Gaining a UK commitment to a 20 per cent share of the aircraft is regarded as important by British Aerospace because that is approximately the amount of work which goes into the aircraft's wings. BAe fears that if it does not build the wings the German aerospace company Dasa will usurp its position. Once Dasa is established as a wing-maker, BAe fears that it will not be able to win its place back in future civil Airbus programmes. BAe may be over-emphasising its dilemma: the total size of the FLA programme is not yet clear and work-sharing arrangements may be flexible. On the Eurofighter programme, for example, Germany looks likely to order fewer than a quarter of all aircraft, but is trying to hang on to a third of the work. However, an early decision to buy the new Hercules would be damaging to BAe  -and the company has a case for arguing that a decision is being rushed. The MoD has put up a strong fight for an early resolution of the debate: it says the existing Hercules fleet is almost 30 years old and, according to a House of Commons defence committee report, the Hercules' wings, tails, fuel systems and flight deck will all need refurbishment in the next few years if they are to remain in service. Ageing is also reducing reliability, says the Ministry of Defence, and pushing up maintenance costs. The ministry says each Hercules is only available for 55 per cent of the time now, compared with 65 per cent in 1986. Worse is to come. The MoD estimates that the annual support costs of the fleet will treble by 1998 without a programme of large-scale refurbishment. Thus, for the Ministry of Defence, Lockheed's offer to begin early deliveries has attractions. But there are doubts about how urgently the aircraft need to be replaced. The House of Commons select committee noted 'allegations' that the RAF may be exaggerating the urgency of its requirements; the RAF sees an opportunity to get new aircraft while there is still money available in its equipment budget. Similarly, the MoD and the Treasury have motives for a quick decision: the ministry is anxious to announce equipment orders to counter the bad publicity over job cuts, and the Treasury regards the C130J as the less expensive option and is attracted by the good terms currently on offer from Lockheed. To counter such views and participate fully in the FLA programme, BAe must persuade the government to implement its preferred strategy: a minimum refurbishment on the existing Hercules fleet while waiting for the FLA to become available. However that route was described by the House of Commons defence committee as, 'prima facie an unattractive option' and it is clear that BAe faces considerable hurdles: it would have to overcome doubts about the cost of refurbishing the current fleet and squeeze a cheque for Pounds 500m to cover the UK's contribution to FLA development funds from a cash-strapped MoD. At present, BAe is simply arguing for more time to develop and present its case, since the FLA will only complete its feasibility study at the end of the year. It has used newspaper advertisements to raise public interest in the issue and pressure the MoD to postpone a decision. One option it is considering is an offer to maintain the Hercules fleet at a fixed price until the FLA is available. For BAe, a request for a delay does not seem unreasonable given the importance of the decision to the UK aerospace industry. As one defence industry observer puts it: 'Lockheed is not going to go away and this is a decision the UK will be stuck with for 40 years. It will have knock-on consequences throughout the civil and military aerospace sector. It may just be worth taking another six months to make sure we get it right.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] During the Perspectives for Euro-Asian Integration  round-table discussion in Moscow today Russian Vice Premier  Sergey Shakhray highly appraised the initiative on establishment  of the Euro-Asian Union put forward by Kazakh President  Nursultan Nazarbayev.    Shakhray said that the matter was not whether to unite or  not  but how to unite.    Shakhray stressed that integration must be carried out in a  civilized way, equitably and voluntarily, preserving the  political sovereignty of the countries involved. Otherwise, he  said, the result could be the use of force.    Shakhray said that the issue of uniting and restoring  economic and other ties was now a factor of political stability  in all CIS states, including Russia.    "The forms and the title of the new integration can vary,"  Shakhray said. He added that the CIS will be becoming more and  more efficient and friendship with Russia will be the victor at  the presidential elections in Belarus and Ukraine.</p>

			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL HAS CASH ON ITS MIND IN CONFERENCE SHUFFLE  </P> <P> College sports have been thrown to the wolves in the suits. The coaches and  players can take the next few years off. They're strictly small print. No one  in the know cares about touchdowns, turnovers or three-point shots. Realignment  is the game right now. The big-money game.  </P> <P> The lawyers and accountants and demographics whizzes have moved in. They're the  ones in charge. No questions asked. It's a negotiating free-for-all. Anyone can  talk to anyone else. All rules are off. All traditions are old news, not worth  a nickel. We're talking about a revolution.  </P> <P> Who is No. 1? The team with the best defense? Nope. The conference that cuts  the best deal. The conference that gets the largest share of the television  market. That's what college sports are all about now -- television shares.  </P> <P> The games may look the same, but they will never be the same. Decades-old  conference ties are being snipped, new ones sewed. Some conferences may die,  others merge. There will be a championship football playoff one of these years  -- that looks certain now, at least from this seat. Bowls won't be the end-all  anymore. As always, some little people probably will pay.  </P> <P> Is it a shame? Sure it is. Change isn't necessarily bad, and there's nothing  wrong with trying to make money, but these people are tromping all over the  history and many of the traditions of their sports. You say nothing is like it  used to be? Well, college sports -- particularly football -- may soon be  Exhibit A.  </P> <P> It all started after last season, when Penn State jumped to the Big Ten and  Notre Dame signed its own football TV contract. It was clear, despite the  conference's altruistic posturing, that the Big Ten was trying to make itself  more attractive to the networks. It was also suddenly clear that networks were  only going to be signing football deals with individual conferences and  schools. It's called a free market.  </P> <P> Suddenly, conferences are considering annexing schools that would make them  more attractive to the networks, and schools are mulling the positives and  negatives of jumping to different conferences.  </P> <P> What should we make of it? The smart money says that four or five football  super-conferences are going to emerge from this mishmash in the coming years,  that they will annex enough big names to push many of the other conferences out  of business. The top candidates are the Big Ten, Pac-10, SEC and ACC, all of  which appear to be gaining weight instead of -- like the Southwest -- losing  it.  </P> <P> If you're going to try to follow it all, don't think logically. Regionalism,  long the backbone of college sports, doesn't matter much anymore. The Big Ten  proved that by taking Penn State, which is about 1,000 miles from some of its  new "brothers." And Texas going to the Pac-10? Last time I checked, Texas was a  long, long way from the Pacific Ocean.  </P> <P> But, see, annexing Texas makes sense for the Pac-10 in this new order, because  it would boost the conference's share of the national television market from  14% to more than 20%. The conference would be in a better position to negotiate  a football deal with one of the networks.  </P> <P> Of course, all this probably will mean the end of some smaller sports, which  will be even less cost-efficient in conferences covering so much territory.  Let's talk about that dual track meet between Penn State and Minnesota. How  long do you think the schools would be willing to take a loss on that?  </P> <P> Not all the changes will be bad. The emergence of super-conferences will mean  more quality games during the football regular season. As things stand now,  everyone except Notre Dame tries to schedule as many sure wins as possible.  It's largely a bore.  </P> <P> But the devaluation of the football bowls will be sad. The question of who is  No. 1 sustains furious debate and a healthy dose of anarchy; it is one of the  last gray areas left in sports, and replacing it with a sterile,  made-for-television tournament will contribute to deadening the game, not  enlivening it.  </P></p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Restaurants: Think of a quality drink IF I WERE lunching well for a fiver, I would be tempted to spend the money I was saving (if you see what I mean) on something good to drink with it. Not that I want quantity. In fact, my ideal lunchtime drink would be one glass of very fine wine indeed. Unfortunately, however, it is taking time for restaurateurs to realise how easy it is nowadays to preserve wine leftovers in a bottle - no complicated machinery, or heavy investment, just a squirt from the Wine Saver can of heavy, inert gas that keeps the harmful oxygen out, Pounds 6-odd from most good wine merchants. In all probability, therefore, I would be lured into buying a whole bottle of wine, and happily the quality and range of the wine lists in the sort of restaurants offering the FT 'Lunch for a Fiver' is generally very good, and far better than was the restaurant norm a few years ago. The following are the sorts of wine I find myself ordering from restaurant wine lists at the moment because they go well with food, are ready to drink, and offer good value: Australian and New Zealand Chardonnays: Usually relatively cheap, and fine so long as they are drunk as young as possible while the acidity is still capable of giving them youthful zest. Each new vintage tends to bring increased subtlety, too. Alsace whites: Pungent, full-bodied dry whites of which Pinot Blanc is best value and Pinot Gris best at spanning the fish and meat gap. One of the very few wine regions where both 1992 and 1991 vintages will be remembered with pleasure. Cote Chalonnaise burgundy: Names such as Givry, Rully and Mercurey are often more reliable than the grander and much more expensive ones of the Cote d'Or to the north. The 1990 reds are particularly delicious at the moment. Oddball Italians: I have found good value among Italian reds and whites with unfamiliar names and lowish prices. If wines cannot be sold on the basis of their fame, you can be pretty sure they have been chosen because they offer real interest and flavour. California Pinot Noir: Oddly, almost shamefully, a more reliable bet than the real thing from Burgundy - especially from the likes of Acacia, Au Bon Climat, Calera and Saintsbury. 1987 Pomerols, 1989 and 1990 lesser clarets: If ever a Bordeaux combo qualified as that elusive commodity 'restaurant wine', it is the delightful 1987s from Pomerol. The vintage does not score in the Bordeaux charts but good bottles of Pomerol (and some Pauillac) are delicious for current drinking. Throughout Bordeaux, on the other hand, 1989 and 1990 produced some particularly luscious red wines. Lower ranking wines such as AC Bordeaux and village wines (Margaux and St Julien, for example) are designed for the table, not the cellar, and can provide real current drinking pleasure.

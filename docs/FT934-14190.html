			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (8): A landmark in technology - Aerospace components THE FOUR wheels on the main landing gear of the new Airbus A330/340 aircraft are fastened to the leg of the undercarriage by a highly-stressed 'bogey beam' containing numerous complex curved surfaces. For Airbus it represents an effective lightweight solution to the task of supporting the landing force of a 257-tonne aircraft. For Dowty Aerospace Landing Gear of Gloucester, which supplies the beam as part of a Pounds 300m contract for the whole A330/340 landing gear, the beam represents a landmark in its development and use of advanced design and manufacturing technology. According to Mr Chris Morgan of Dowty, who played a leading role in the development project, the beam was 'the first major component' that the company has produced purely electronically, without any physical mock-ups during the whole programme. As such, the beam represents a key element in the engineering strategies that Dowty and other aerospace companies are implementing in pursuit of their business aims. At Dowty, Mr Morgan is engineering group leader for new projects and is in charge of developing the company's use of computers in a change programme that got under way two years ago. The aims are to introduce concurrent engineering, in other words the simultaneous execution of previously sequential tasks, as a normal working practice and support the development of advanced, low-weight landing gear designs. An essential requirement, he says, is to make 3D computer modelling the standard way of carrying out design work and to integrate design software with the various specialist analysis packages, such as finite element programs, used by the company. The company is therefore phasing out use of its old Graftek CAD software and stepping up use of the Catia software marketed by IBM. It has also invested Pounds 250,000 in new workstation hardware - IBM Risc and Hewlett-Packard machines - so that all its design and analysis software now runs in a uniform Unix-operating environment and data can be transferred between different programs easily and quickly. Such internal data transfers use the IGES (Initial Graphics Exchange Specification) translation software, though in a version 'flavoured' slightly to Dowty's own needs. Consequently, says Mr Morgan, computerised finite element analysis is now an everyday tool rather than an occasional resource for particularly complex tasks. Modern workstation hardware also runs the Command CNC (Computer Numerical Control) software package that now drives shopfloor machine tools. The company's main manufacturing-related investment, however, has been in a new Pounds 45m plant in Canada where other parts of the A330/340 landing gear are made. Elsewhere in the industry similar strategies and achievements are in evidence. Rolls-Royce Aeroengines in Derby has spent Pounds 10m over the last four years installing some 700 Unix workstation platforms - this time Sun and Silicon Graphics machines. The aim, as Mr Derek Gale, head of engineering systems, makes clear, is again 'integration', with the objective of cutting total engine development times by one third. Nevertheless, he says that the company has had to trim back investment in the recession and that the policy has been one of 'minimum' necessary investment. Ultimately, the company wants all 4,000 of its engineering staff to have their own terminals, though some of them will be able to make do with PCs. An equally significant long-term goal is the introduction of full engineering data management, in effect the integration of all business and technical information. This will enable the company to have every bit of information about 'every engine going out of the door' in a single database. One difference between Rolls-Royce and Dowty, however, is the former's much more guarded attitude towards standardised data transfer by means such as IGES. Rolls-Royce prefers to use a series of customised links to integrate its design and analysis programs. This lack of uniformity is also evident in the area of design data exchange between aircraft and engine builders and both their customers and component suppliers. Unlike the car industry where computerised data exchange is virtually the norm, there has been little concerted effort in this direction. Instead, there is a mix of data transfer between identical CAD systems, dissimilar systems using IGES and a still heavy reliance on the use of paper drawings. A major reason is the establishment of de facto communications standards for specific areas of aircraft based on particular proprietary CAD systems. Dowty's adoption of Catia, for instance, was prompted by the fact that the software was already widely used for landing gear design. Unsurprisingly, the techniques now being pioneered in the civil aircraft industry are also being thoroughly exploited in the military world. The latest version of the Harrier jump-jet, the T10, due to make its maiden flight very shortly, has been developed jointly by British Aerospace and McDonnell Douglas in the US. BAe has had responsibility for the complete rear half of the fuselage and, according to Mr Gary Smith, group leader for CAD applications for the company's Military Aircraft Division at Farnborough, modelled the structure completely in 3D computer form. That enabled the design team to calculate the lengths of cable and wire running through the section 'with 99.9 per cent accuracy'. Previously, it would have been necessary to build a full-size wooden mock-up or even buy in a real fuselage section. BAe would adopt the same approach, Mr Smith adds, even for a completely new aircraft development project. At the manufacturing level the use of computer-controlled machine tools fed with information directly from the design database is now standard technology. The real differentiating factor between companies is how effectively they organise their use of the technology and link it to streamlined working practices. Short Brothers in Belfast, for instance, which is now making major structural components for several customers including Boeing, is currently three-quarters of the way through a Pounds 200m investment programme that will completely modernise all its production plant. It is also using a software system called Matrix, developed jointly with AT&amp;T Istel, that helps maximise the utilisation of individual pieces of equipment. Mr Russell MacFadden, manufacturing engineering director for aircraft, says the investment has been linked with a reorganisation of the company into a series of 'mini-businesses' in which semi-autonomous manufacturing units act as suppliers of business units, concentrating on the needs of particular customers. All development projects are now carried out by multi-disciplinary 'design-build teams' and the company has invested more than Pounds 5m in training to support the necessary 'culture change'. In parallel, it has reduced the number of its component suppliers from around 100 to 14. Future developments will see suppliers becoming full members of project teams.</p>

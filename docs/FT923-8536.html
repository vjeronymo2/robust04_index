			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Germany 'unable' to defend aid convoys: Kinkel may consider cutting links with Serbia GERMANY will not be able, 'unfortunately', to take part in the armed defence of aid convoys in the former Yugoslavia, Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister, said yesterday. While he welcomed the possibility of a scheme to protect shipments of humanitarian aid, he believed constitutional constraints and political problems stemming from Germany's wartime occupation of Yugoslavia probably ruled out direct participation. He assumed that, since the US, Britain and France had brought the issue up in the UN Security Council, they would be prepared to take action, he said in a radio interview. Officials refused to comment on what non-military contributions Germany might be prepared to make. Although funding seems the most likely means, they pointed out that Bonn had already contributed far more humanitarian help than its partners. Meanwhile, Mr Kinkel suggested, Germany was willing to consider breaking all diplomatic links with Serbia and other means of increasing pressure for an end to the war. A European conference in London on August 26 would discuss further tightening the trade embargo, especially on land routes, and the exclusion of Serbia and Montenegro from all international organisations. Mainstream German political opinion, while solidly against any outside military involvement, has hardened in the past few days, following the transmission of pictures of prisoners in Serbian internment camps. Many leaders are now resigned to the view that action will ultimately be necessary, although an opinion poll yesterday showed a 77 per cent majority against intervention. Mr Bjorn Engholm, the leader of the Social Democrat (SPD) opposition, yesterday rebuked party members for breaking ranks and calling for military action. However, even he suggested that in extremis his party might accept German participation under strict control and conditions. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who spoke at the weekend of 'concentration camps' and 'genocide' in Bosnia, said he would immediately reopen talks on German military involvement in the event of the UN approving an all-out blockade against Serbia. Germany's limited contribution in the aerial and warship-based monitoring of Adriatic sea routes is to be examined in the constitutional court in Karlsruhe following an appeal from the SPD. The US yesterday secured the backing of over 30 countries for an unprecedented extraordinary session of the UN Human Rights Commission on human rights abuses in Bosnia-Hercegovina and elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia. Agreement of 27 countries was required to call the session of the 53-member commission, which will meet in Geneva next Thursday and Friday, Frances Williams writes from Geneva. A US-drafted resolution, with western backing, draws attention to 'gross violations' of human rights in the region, calls for immediate access to detention camps for the International Committee of the Red Cross, and mandates the UN secretary general to appoint one or more special representatives to investigate human rights abuses. Last week Washington said it had begun discussion at the UN on a Security Council resolution on war crimes, which would make the states of the former Yugoslavia as well as individuals punishable for violations of international humanitarian law.</p>

			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / International Company News: Sales climb 4.6% at La Rinascente Sales at La Rinascente, the Italian retail group, rose 4.6 per cent to L2,626bn (Dollars 1.7bn) in the first half of this year. The group's hypermarkets, supermarkets and cash-and-carry stores, which account for an increasing proportion of turnover, reported sales of L1,734bn, up 6 per cent, while other outlets, including department stores, turned over L891.2bn, up 2 per cent on the equivalent period. Pre-tax profit edged up to L27bn in the first half of 1994, against L25.3bn. The company said the imbalance between the first and second halves - with the second six months accounting for most of the sales volume - made it impossible to forecast full-year results. Last year, net profits rose from L102.2bn to L105.3bn, although the results were almost overshadowed by the sale of 33 per cent of the retailer by Fiat, the automotive and industrial group headed by Mr Gianni Agnelli, to Ifil, the Agnelli family's industrial holding company. The move was criticised by investors. La Rinascente has confirmed that Mr Luigi Arnaudo, the deputy chairman, was now responsible for the operating management of the company.</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Midlands Electric buys back 10% of its shares Midlands Electricity bought back 10 per cent of its shares for Pounds 153.5m yesterday, following the well-established practice among electricity utilities. The buy-back, carried out by Cazenove, the company's stockbrokers, was undertaken to increase earnings per share, Midlands said. Shareholder approval was obtained at the annual meeting in August. The buy-back of 21m shares was made at an average price of 725p. The shares closed up 13p at 714p as other electricity stocks also gained strongly. As with a recent buy-back by Northern Electric, the deal was structured in a way that should enable institutional investors to treat the proceeds as a distribution qualifying for a tax credit. But Midlands said it was up to individual investors to negotiate the credits with the Inland Revenue.</p>

Nowadays, reports are being published regularly in the  national press stating that the U.S. has asked Pakistan to hand  over 16 narcotics smugglers who are considered by U.S.  Government departments to be major figures in the narcotics  smuggling business. According to reports, the Government of  Pakistan has so far arrested 11 smugglers and has speeded up  efforts to capture the remaining escaped smugglers. We consider  the Government of Pakistan justified in refusing to hand over  narcotics smugglers to the U.S. The government's action was in  line with the national priorities of an independent country.  Undoubtedly, narcotics smugglers do not deserve any special  treatment; these individuals have inflicted the greatest injury  on Pakistan where the number of addicts has now reached 2  million. The economy of the country has been undermined by the  black wealth of the drug dealers; hence, we have always  advocated strong action against drug smugglers. However, the  manner in which the U.S. press has suddenly started a propaganda  campaign against Pakistan regarding narcotics and the U.S. has  begun to insist that smugglers be handed over shows clearly that  interference is taking place in the affairs of an independent  and free country; moreover, such actions imply that our laws and  system of justice are not dependable. No country, not even a  world power, has the right to issue directives or orders to  another country. In regard to the U.S. demand, one should also  remember that under the pretext of bringing these smugglers to  justice, the U.S. could wage a propaganda campaign against  Pakistan on the national and international level and thus  inflict great injury on Pakistan's reputation. At any rate, if a  criminal is a Pakistani, then Pakistan alone should have the  right to take action against him. It would be very dangerous to  allow a foreign country to take action against any criminal  within Pakistan.</p>

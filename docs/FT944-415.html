			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Labour hits at Guinness delays Labour yesterday warned that the City of London's international reputation could be at stake as it attacked the government's handling of the decision to refer the cases of the four men convicted over the Guinness affair to the Court of Appeal. Mr Alistair Darling, a shadow Treasury spokesman, said there would be 'immense political repercussions for the government' if the Guinness convictions were overturned. The reputation of the City of London was 'bound to be damaged,' he said. Mr Darling was speaking after it emerged that Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, decided to refer the cases of the four men to the Court of Appeal shortly after lawyers for two of them started legal proceedings against him. In the three days before Mr Howard's decision was announced, solicitors acting for Mr Gerald Ronson, the property developer, and Mr Anthony Parnes, the former stockbroker, applied for a judicial review of the home secretary's failure to reach a decision on reopening the cases. Mr Darling said: 'No home secretary should ever find himself in a position of having to make a decision of this magnitude in 72 hours. The government had been aware of possible problems with the Guinness prosecution for some considerable time.' Mr Darling called for the current review of the Serious Fraud Office, which brought the prosecution, to be 'brought to a head' early in the new year. It was difficult to overestimate the importance of a system of policing that commanded confidence, he said. 'If the policing system is fundamentally flawed, it is worse than having no system at all.' Labour would be urging an early government statement on the issue. Lawyers connected with the cases of the four men expect it will be months rather than weeks before they are heard by the Court of Appeal. The timing could prove difficult for the Serious Fraud Office, which next May faces another legal challenge to its Guinness prosecutions. Mr Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chairman, is to ask the European Court of Human Rights to uphold and make legally binding a judgment of the European Commission of Human Rights that his trial was unfair because it heard evidence given by him under compulsion to trade department inspectors.</p>

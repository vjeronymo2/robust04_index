In making such adjustments to their uses, States must ensure that downstream uses are protected, and that during other seasons or after the storm event has passed, the use is fully protected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to defining recreational uses with greater specificity, States are also encouraged to define the aquatic uses more precisely. Rather than ``aquatic life use protection,'' States should consider defining the type of fishery to be protected such as a cold water fishery (e.g., trout or salmon) or a warm weather fishery (e.g., bluegill or large mouth bass). Explicitly defining the type of fishery to be protected may assist the permittee in enlisting the support of citizens for a CSO control plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A water quality standard variance may be appropriate, in limited circumstances on CSO-impacted waters, where the State is uncertain as to whether a standard can be attained and time is needed for the State to conduct additional analyses on the attainability of the standard. Variances are short-term modifications in water quality standards. Subject to EPA approval, States, with their own statutory authority, may grant a variance to a specific discharger for a specific pollutant. The justification for a variance is similar to that required for a permanent change in the standard, although the showings needed are less rigorous. Variances are also subject to public participation requirements of the water quality standards and permits programs and are reviewable generally every three years. A variance allows the CSO permit to be written to meet the ``modified'' water quality standard as analyses are conducted and as progress is made to improve water quality.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Justifications for variances are the same as those identified in 40 CFR 131.10(g) for modifications in uses. States must provide an opportunity for public review and comment on all variances. If States use the permit as the vehicle to grant the variance, notice of the permit must clearly state that the variance modifies the State's water quality standards. If the variance is approved, the State appends the variance to the State's standards and reviews the variance every three years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Expectations for Permitting Authorities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> A. Overview  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CSOs are point sources subject to NPDES permit requirements including both technology-based and water quality-based requirements of the CWA. CSOs are not subject to secondary treatment regulations applicable to publicly owned treatment works ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Montgomery Environmental Coalition  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> vs.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Costle,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 646 F.2d 568 (D.C. Cir. 1980)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All permits for CSOs should require the nine minimum controls as a minimum best available technology economically achievable and best conventional technology (BAT/BCT) established on a best professional judgment (BPJ) basis by the permitting authority (40 CFR 125.3). Water quality-based requirements are to be established based on applicable water quality standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This policy establishes a uniform, nationally consistent approach to developing and issuing NPDES permits to permittees with CSOs. Permits for CSOs should be developed and issued expeditiously. A single, system-wide permit generally should be issued for all discharges, including CSOs, from a CSS operated by a single authority. When different parts of a single CSS are operated by more than one authority, permits issued to each authority should generally require joint preparation and implementation of the elements of this Policy and should specifically define the responsibilities and duties of each authority. Permittees should be required to coordinate system-wide implementation of the nine minimum controls and the development and implementation of the long-term CSO control plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The individual authorities are responsible for their own discharges and should cooperate with the permittee for the POTW receiving the flows from the CSS. When a CSO is permitted separately from the POTW, both permits should be cross-referenced for informational purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA Regions and States should review the CSO permitting priorities established in the State CSO Permitting Strategies developed in response to the 1989 Strategy. Regions and States may elect to revise these previous priorities. In setting permitting priorities, Regions and States should not just focus on those permittees that have initiated monitoring programs. When setting priorities, Regions and States should consider, for example, the known or potential impact of CSOs on sensitive areas, and the extent of upstream industrial user discharges to the CSS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

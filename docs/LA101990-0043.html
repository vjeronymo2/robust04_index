			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PRICE CUTS UNABLE TO SPUR HOME SALES  </P> <P> Mike Collins has some advice for homeowners thinking of putting a "FOR SALE"  sign on their front lawn -- think twice.  </P> <P> "It is a wonderful buyer's market, and we are encouraging everyone who doesn't  need to be on the market right now to pull off," said Collins, a Hermosa Beach  real estate broker and president of the South Bay Board of Realtors.  </P> <P> That would hardly have been Collins' advice 30 months ago, when many properties  sold soon after the sign had been driven into the ground and sometimes even  before they made the realtors' listing book.  </P> <P> "It was exciting, it was hectic, it was bedlam," Collins recalled. "We could  hardly get a listing to hang around a few days before we had an offer on it."  </P> <P> Today, local agents say, the market is characterized by a crush of listings  with some sellers sharply reducing their prices and still waiting months to  unload their properties.  </P> <P> "Everybody has a house to sell," said agent Susan McNeill, who is offering  homes at the new Sea Bluff development in Rancho Palos Verdes, where prices  have been reduced $100,000 to $150,000 to spur sales. The homes are now listed  at $650,000 to $850,000.  </P> <P> At the same time, relationships between agents and sellers are being tested as  the two sides square off over just how much a home should be listed for. Agents  are now faced with the unpleasant task of telling clients that their homes may  not fetch as much as the one down the street did six or seven months ago --  even though the homes are clones.  </P> <P> "It's tough because they think you are trying to rip them off," said a veteran  South Bay agent who did not want to be identified.  </P> <P> Generally, agents said lower-priced homes and very expensive homes, whose  buyers aren't as affected by ups and downs in the economy, are moving the most  rapidly.  </P> <P> According to the California Assn. of Realtors, the median price of a home in  California in August was $194,099, down 3.1% from a year ago. In Los Angeles  County, the median price dropped 5%, to $212,170.  </P> <P> South Bay multiple listing figures show that there were 7,146 homes, including  condominiums, on the market at the end of September, up from 5,196 during the  same period last year. On the average, it took 109 days to sell a home,  compared to 76 days during the same period last year, the figures show.  </P> <P> Even though agents say many sellers -- even those living in the South Bay's  most pricey communities -- are slashing prices and waiting longer for an offer,  the local multiple listing numbers do not necessarily indicate that. On the  average, home sellers were getting 94% of their list price through September,  according to the data from the South Bay multiple listing service. For the same  period last year, the figure was 96%.  </P> <P> Just where prices are headed is guesswork for agents and housing experts, many  of whom peg their forecasts to the outcome of the Middle East and national  budget crises and the direction of interest rates and inflation.  </P> <P> Barring major bad economic news, Kathleen Connell, chairwoman of the Center for  Finance and Real Estate at UCLA's Anderson Graduate School of Management, said  she believes local real estate prices will probably remain flat in 1991, with  perhaps a slight increase in the fourth quarter. Leslie Appleton-Young, vice  president for research and economics for the state realtors association,  predicted prices will remain steady the remainder of this year and next.  </P> <P> Some agents and housing experts say the present slowdown was predictable  because home prices in recent years have escalated to a level where many people  simply found it difficult or impossible to afford a home. In the South Bay  beach cities, for example, a so-called starter home now sells in the  neighborhood of $325,000, Redondo Beach real estate agent David Teague said.  </P> <P> "I think just pure affordability is a problem in our market," he said. ". . .  (The) first-time buyer segment is getting smaller and smaller."  </P> <P> Others said they believe a lack of consumer confidence is also having an impact  on the market. People wondering whether their jobs are secure or if they are  going to receive a year-end bonus are reluctant to trade up to a more expensive  home, they said.  </P> <P> "They are not going to commit themselves to buying a bigger home in a better  community," Connell said.  </P> <P> Connell said that she also believes that consumers are simply resisting high  housing costs, figuring prices are too high for what they are getting. "People  are beginning to show some skepticism about the cost of housing in California,"  she said.  </P> <P> Connell predicted that the real estate market is returning to more normal  times. Over a 10-year period, figures show the average time it takes to sell a  home in California is 10 to 12 months, she said.  </P> <P> That's probably small consolation to sellers who expected their homes to be on  the market for several months at the most, only to find themselves having to  endure long waits and price reductions. Redondo Beach broker Vince DeLuca said  his office listed a home for $750,000 a year ago. Even though the owner has  dropped the price more than $120,000, it is still on the market.  </P> <P> Even in the most desireable areas of the Palos Verdes Peninsula, the pattern of  long listings and reduced prices is being repeated. William Michel, a retired  aerospace worker who lives in Palos Verdes Estates, put his five-bedroom home  on the market in January for $697,500. Even though he has lowered the price to  $664,500, he still hasn't had an offer.  </P> <P> Michel, who has purchased another home in Oceanside contingent on his own home  selling, says he is in a quandary over whether he should reduce his price  further.  </P> <P> "If I had a little crystal ball and could say very well what was going to  happen, I might be interested in dropping (the price)," he said.  </P> <P> Sellers willing to list their homes at a realistic price have a much better  chance of getting an offer, agents said.  </P> <P> "The bottom line as far as I am concerned is always the price," said the agent  who did not want to be identified. "The main problem I feel is people don't  want to concede prices have gone down."  </P> <P> The agent said he refinanced his home last November; it was appraised at  $390,000. "Right now I have run comparables and it looks like I would get  $350,000," he said.  </P> <P> The present market has produced its share of bargain hunters hoping to pick up  a great deal, agents said. Nevertheless, the agents predict such buyers will be  sorely disappointed if they are waiting for home prices to fall precipitously.  </P> <P> "If they are waiting for the bottom to fall out, they are waiting in the wrong  neighborhood," Collins said. "There just has never been any evidence of that in  the South Bay."  </P></p>

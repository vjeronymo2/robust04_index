			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / International Company News: Results at AMD are better than expected ADVANCED Micro Devices, the US semiconductor manufacturer, reported higher-than-expected fourth-quarter and year-end sales and earnings, boosted by strong sales of its microprocessors to personal computer makers. Fourth-quarter revenues rose 9 per cent to Dollars 400.2m from Dollars 366.2m while net income was Dollars 69.6m, before preferred stock dividends, or 73 cents a share after the dividend. A year ago AMD reported net income of Dollars 106.7m, or Dollars 1.17 a share, after the dividend. Net earnings included a gain equivalent to 52 cents a share from the sale of shares of Xilinx, another chip maker. 'AMD had an excellent quarter capping off an excellent year,' said Mr W. J. Sanders, chairman and chief executive. Shipments of 386 microprocessors surpassed 3m, a record for the company, he said. For the year, AMD reported record sales of Dollars 1.5bn, an increase of 23 per cent over 1991. Net income of Dollars 245m before the preferred stock dividend, and Dollars 2.57 a share after the dividend, also reached a new high for the company. For 1991, revenues were Dollars 1.2bn and net income Dollars 145.3m, or Dollars 1.53 a share, after the dividend. AMD was recently forced to postpone plans to introduce a next-generation 486 microprocessor after an unfavourable court ruling in its intellectual property disputes with Intel, the largest US chip maker.</p>

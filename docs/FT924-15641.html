			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / International Company News: Daf close to securing loans of Fl 210m DAF, the loss-making Dutch commercial vehicles maker, repeated yesterday that it was close to securing Fl 210m (Dollars 130m) in loans from a Dutch and a Belgian bank. The company's assurances were issued yesterday afternoon to counter a string of adverse stock market rumours that had knocked its shares to an all-time low in early trading on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. Daf, which is 16 per cent owned by British Aerospace, said speculation that it was facing payments difficulties were totally unfounded. It also denied that the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, which has been handling the request for a state-backed loan, was opposed to the company's recent moves to explore possible strategic links with foreign industrial partners. Daf is known to be holding talks with both Daimler-Benz of Germany and with Hino Motors of Japan. Shares in Daf fell by Fl 2.60 to a low of Fl 12.60 in morning trading before recovering to Fl 13.60 mid-session. They later closed at Fl 13.20, down 13.2 per cent on the day. Daf said that the Fl 100m subordinated loan from the Dutch National Investment Bank would carry conversion rights into ordinary shares and would have a life of 6.5 years. A loan agreement is expected to be signed in the next few days, it added. It is also close to agreement with NMKN, a Belgian bank, on a Fl 110m non-subordinated loan which would largely be guaranteed by authorities in the Flemish part of Belgium, where Daf owns an axles plant. Responding to a Dutch press report, a spokesman said he could not rule out that Daf officials had mentioned a higher figure than Fl 100m in their loan talks with the Dutch government, but he added that no written request for additional loans had been submitted.</p>

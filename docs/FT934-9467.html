			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report TIN prices collapsed on the London Metal Exchange yesterday afternoon when the market broke below the Dollars 4,700 a tonne floor of the current Dollars 200 technical range, dealers said. Sell stops pushed tin to a low of Dollars 4,640 a tonne before some bargain-hunting trade buying emerged after hours. Three-month tin closed Dollars 168 a tonne down at Dollars 4,649.50. NICKEL capitalised on the recent improvement in sentiment, which has resulted in less selling pressure when the market moves up. However, dealers suggest the market remains oversupplied and is still in need of further production cuts. Yesterday's advance petered out near the Dollars 4,800 a tonne level once more and three-month prices finished at Dollars 4,757.50, up Dollars 30. SILVER after a relatively strong performance on the New York Commodity Exchange on Monday closed in London last night 40 cents up at Dollars 4.525 an ounce. London SUGAR fell sharply yesterday afternoon in hectic New York-led fund liquidation. Both white and raw sugar lost ground, but by late afternoon in London the markets had steadied and prices recovered. Compiled from Reuters</p>

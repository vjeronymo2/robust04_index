			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Fears on 'phantom' cash withdrawals dismissed THE EXTENT of so-called phantom withdrawals and fraud from cash machines has been exaggerated, according to Halifax building society's senior lawyer. A well-publicised High Court class action launched against Barclays Bank and other card issuers had fuelled public fears about the safety of automatic telling machines (ATMs), Mr Christopher Jowett told the International Bar Association in New Orleans yesterday. Since the adoption of the banking code of practice last year limiting customers' liability to Pounds 50 and placing the burden of proving fraud on the card-issuer, banks had been paying out on phantom withdrawal claims more regularly. But it was easy to exaggerate the size of the problem. Halifax has just under 3m cards on issue, handling 130m transactions a year. Last year there were more than 1,000 alleged phantom withdrawals involving Pounds 238,000. Halifax payed out in 334 cases, refunding Pounds 69,000. Mr Jowett said that, in reality, there was no such thing as a phantom withdrawal. Fraud lay at the heart of most un-explained automatic transactions. There was, however, a need to reassure the public about the security of ATM systems. Banks and building societies had to take steps to ensure opportunities for fraud, particularly inside banks, were cut to a minimum. He said public confidence in the integrity of card transactions could only be maintained by improving methods of card authentication and card verification. There had been some discussion in the UK about the use of personal identification numbers (PINs) at the point of sale for credit card and debit card transactions. But UK card issuers were extremely concerned about the risk of PIN numbers being compromised, said Mr Jowett.</p>

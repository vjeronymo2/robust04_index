			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / WPP cautious on fragile upturn WPP GROUP, the marketing services company, remains cautious about an upturn in its markets in spite of reporting pre-tax profits of Pounds 24.1m, up from Pounds 1.8m, in the half year to June 30. The result was helped by the absence of last year's Pounds 13.5m restructuring charge. Mr Martin Sorrell, chief executive, said: 'The economic recovery, such as it is, remains delicate and unsettled especially in the US and the UK. On the basis of client experience to date, it is possible that a recovery will be delayed for some time.' The group is paying an interim dividend of 0.35p, as it forecast at the time of its rights issue in March: the first payout since 1990. The shares rose 3p to 93p. Reorganisation and rationalisation costs of Pounds 3.9m covered severance pay. Operating profit before this cost rose to Pounds 46.5m (from Pounds 35.1m). Billings increased to Pounds 2.9bn (from Pounds 2.5bn) and group revenues rose by 16.4 per cent to Pounds 699.8m, although more than 10 per cent of that rise was due to the weaker pound. Revenues in media advertising increased by 7.4 per cent in the first half. J Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &amp; Mather generated net new business billings of more than Pounds 156m (Dollars 235m) and Pounds 117m (Dollars 176m) respectively. However, while US advertising is showing signs of recovery, the group voiced its concern about the extent to which President Clinton's tax proposals could affect US companies, which in turn might cut back on their advertising. Public relation companies continued to lose money. Hill &amp; Knowlton and Ogilvy Adams &amp; Rinehart reported combined losses of Pounds 4.8m, up from Pounds 400,000. Net debt fell to Pounds 372m (from Pounds 476m) resulting in a lower interest charge of Pounds 15.6m (from Pounds 20.5m). The average net debt figure reflects three months of proceeds of its Pounds 85m rights issue. The group hopes to reduce borrowings further with the sale of Scali McCabe Sloves, the US agency. That sale is expected to fetch between Dollars 40m (Pounds 26.8m) and Dollars 60m. In the long-term, WPP is considering the flotation of its market research activities in south-east Asia and the sale of one or two smaller companies. Earnings per share of 2.5p compare with a loss of 7.6p. Lex, Page 14</p>

			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / WHO acts on allegations of vote-buying THE WORLD Health Organisation decided yesterday to tighten its financial rules after allegations of vote-buying in the recent election of its chief, Dr Hiroshi Nakajima, Reuter reports from Geneva. In a resolution adopted by consensus at the agency's annual assembly, member states asked Dr Nakajima to set a clear policy on granting contracts to members of the WHO executive board, which implements the decisions of the annual WHO assembly. The move follows a highly critical external audit which found shortcomings in six contracts awarded to members of the 31-member board before it renominated Dr Nakajima in January. Member states confirmed the nomination by 98 votes to 53 last Wednesday, giving Dr Nakajima five more years as director-general of the United Nations agency. The external audit by Britain's auditor-general Sir John Bourn did not directly link any of the contracts to Dr Nakajima, but pointed out that five of them had been signed off by another senior Japanese official in the UN agency. Monday's resolution, which still needs the formal approval of the plenary assembly, welcomed an announcement by Dr Nakajima last week that he planned significant reforms of the agency. However it asked him to take further steps to implement the auditor's recommendations. Unesco's cash flow has improved significantly in the past few months, Mr Frederico Mayor, director general, told a public meeting of its executive board in Paris yesterday. The organisation has received Dollars 116m from member state's since the board last met in October, Mr Mayor said. The organisation, which is perennially short of cash, was forced to borrow money last October, but Mr Mayor said these loans had now been repaid in full. Unesco now has a surplus of Dollars 30m, Mr Mayor said. The head of the UN Environment Programme pleaded yesterday for more cash to help Unep end bad planning and implement priority programmes. Ms Elizabeth Dowdeswell, executive director, told a Unep governing council meeting in the Kenyan capital Nairobi that without a stable budget the environment watchdog would 'simply not have the means to implement the tasks assigned to it.'</p>

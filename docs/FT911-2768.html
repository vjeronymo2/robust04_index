			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Sanctions warning to Japan: Construction, intellectual property worry Washington THE Bush Administration yesterday warned Japan it would impose sanctions for its failure to open its public construction market and gave China, India and Thailand six to nine months to improve their protection of intellectual property before also facing trade curbs. Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, said the US would bar Japanese companies from all federal government construction projects unless agreement was reached in 30 days to improve access for US companies wishing to enter the Japanese construction market. Japanese companies have been making on average about Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.4bn) a year for projects in the US market. US companies have won contracts worth only Dollars 200m since 1988. Mrs Hills identified China, India and Thailand under the Special 301 provision of the 1988 trade law as 'Priority Foreign Countries'. These are countries whose failure to enforce laws protecting patents, copyrights, trademarks or software is deemed to be 'the most onerous and egregious.' Under Special 301, the trade representative may impose sanctions after six to nine months of negotiations. Mrs Hills said the sanctions would be 'matched with the results' of the losses incurred by US companies. In another action, Mrs Hills cited Norway for discrimination against US companies in its government procurement practices. She has requested consultations with Norway, who she said has violated the Gatt procurement code by excluding US suppliers from the procurement of an electronic toll collection system for the city of Trondheim. She also cited the EC - and Germany, France and Italy separately - for discriminatory practices in procuring heavy electrical equipment or telecommunications equipment. She noted that US and EC negotiators recently agreed to set December 1991 as a target date for 'substantial completion' of an expanded Gatt Procurement Code. Thus she will wait until January 1992 to review the European procurement practices.</p>

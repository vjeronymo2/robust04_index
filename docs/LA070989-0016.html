			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE POLAR CONQUEST OF LOVE;  </P> <P> SPRING THAW BY S. L. STEBEL (WALKER &amp; CO.: $17.95; 236 PP.)  </P> <P> When I was little more than a child my imagination was caught by a book called  "Alone," written by Adm. Richard E. Byrd. Published in 1938, it's the  reflective and ultimately spiritual journal Byrd kept during a solo expedition  to gather meteorological data in the region of the South Pole.  </P> <P> For five months, Byrd lived alone in a shack sunk in the ice with temperatures  reaching minus 50 and 60 degrees. Each day he emerged through a trap door to  read his instruments above ground, also noting the look of things in the polar  winter ("storm-blue bulge of darkness . . .") he was experiencing, and in which  he almost perished. He came to believe that "such beauty was reserved for  distant and dangerous places" which "extract a price from those who would  witness it."  </P> <P> Two or three writers since have succeeded in conjuring up that polar beauty for  me again -- Ursula K. Le Guin in a brilliant story called "Sur," and Doris  Lessing in the fourth of the "Canopus in Argos" books, "The Making of a  Representative for Planet 8." Now I would add S. L. Stebel's evocatively  ice-bound novel, a book of winning beauty and mythology, "Spring Thaw," which  is set on a ship near an island in the region of the North Pole.  </P> <P> The story revolves around an expedition of seal hunters, who set out in a ship  called the Seljegeren for the annual harvest of seal pelts. The Seljegeren's  old captain is ailing and his son, Jason, from whom he is estranged, assumes  command of the ship. The sailor-hunters are anxious for the kill, their annual  livelihood depends on it, and already, other ships are taking up the best  waters. During a fierce storm at sea, Jason stumbles across an old chart in his  father's cabin, and against the advice of the more experienced of his crew,  heads for a cluster of islands called the Mirabelles, where a quick and  bountiful harvest is hoped for.  </P> <P> The ship anchors off the Mirabelles, ice encroaching and threatening to freeze  it in place. A sullen, defeated population greets them hastily, dark and heavy  villagers slogging across the ice like medieval Grendels wary of the stranger  in the mead hall, a broken people who no longer even hunt their own abundant  seals. Some force seems to protect the seals from being killed, as the crew of  the Seljegeren discover when they attempt a slaughter and meet with  inexplicable accidents.  </P> <P> This is no medieval tale however. We are meant to understand that Jason has  witnessed the bombing of a marine base in Lebanon ("We lifted what was left of  once able-bodied men . . . our hands sticky with substances the mind would not  contemplate . . ."), an experience so psychologically destabilizing that he has  been relieved of command in the Navy. Is the destructive, malevolent force he  encounters in the Mirabelles the psychological residue of modern war, or a  "spiritual visitation . . . the creation of shame-ridden mind" in an  ecologically unbalanced world?  </P> <P> In time Jason discovers the truth, which is that the force protecting the seals  is a spirit-woman whom Jason's father had wronged many years ago, and with whom  he engages in a somnambulistic hearth-side fever-love. Now he asks: Is he his  father's rival, a self-deluded fool, or the inheritor of a family curse?  </P> <P> By the time the reader comes to the final father-son confrontation scene,  Jason, like the seeker of the Golden Fleece, has made heroic discoveries  through trial and confrontation, in a story with very modern overtones. "Spring  Thaw" is immensely enjoyable, a book with considerably more going for it than  its evocation of ice-bound wonder, but for this alone, I was rather grateful.  </P></p>

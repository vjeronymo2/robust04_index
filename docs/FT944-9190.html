			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Denmark (2): Welfare costs take their toll - The economy / Fears of inflation have receded Compared with many European countries struggling to overcome recession and high budget deficits, Denmark is in good economic shape. This year, gross domestic product is set to grow by up to 4.5 per cent after a long period of stagnation or recession, spurred by a fall in interest rates late last year and a fiscal stimulus this year and last from the government. In 1995, the pace of growth is expected to slow to around 3 per cent, due to the recent reverse in the interest-rate trend and budgetary tightening, which will check this year's surge in private consumption. But there are few worries about this, as the slower pace of growth has helped to calm fears of inflationary overheating. Inflation has risen along with the pick-up in the economy to a current annual rate of around 2 per cent, but the finance ministry predicts that, over the rest of the decade, it will stabilise around an average of 2.3 per cent. The loosening of fiscal policy over the past two years has skewed the public finances somewhat, leading to a general government budget deficit projected this year to be more than 4 per cent of GDP. But a tightening of the state's belt in the budget for next year will see the deficit decline towards 3 per cent in 1995. Exports continue to grow, sustaining a surplus on the balance-of-payments current account equivalent to more than 2.5 per cent of GDP, and holding down Denmark's once-alarming net foreign debt to well below 30 per cent of GDP. The country is well on course to reach its target of meeting, by 1996 or 1997, all four criteria for inflation, public-sector deficits, public-sector debt and interest rates laid down by the European Union as conditions for achieving European monetary union. 'In sum,' the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development pronounced in August, 'having eliminated most of the imbalances built up in the 1980s, the Danish economy seems set for a period of expansion, based on monetary and exchange-rate stability, relatively sound public finances and a favourable business climate.' There is, however, one outstanding blot in this otherwise bright picture. Denmark has suffered for some years from high levels of unemployment. This year, unemployment stands at just under 12 per cent of the workforce. Without any doubt, unemployment poses the biggest challenge to the future structure and health of the Danish economy. The country, like its Nordic neighbours Sweden, Norway and Finland, has a highly developed state welfare system. But the burden placed on the system by the costs of high unemployment puts it under considerable strain. Although Denmark's public finances are 'relatively sound', they have been kept in this condition by the biggest tax burden in the OECD, equivalent to 50 per cent of GDP. Paying some of the world's most generous unemployment and other welfare benefits has pushed up public expenditure to the equivalent of more than 60 per cent of GDP - second only to Sweden among the 24 countries in the OECD. Mr Mogens Lykketoft, the finance minister, readily acknowledges that, unless unemployment can be significantly reduced, the Social Democratic-led government's primary aim of maintaining the welfare system will be put in jeopardy. 'If you look at the next five to 10 years, if we are not able to change the (budget) deficit into a surplus through a substantial increase in employment, the conclusion must be that we cannot afford the welfare system,' Mr Lykketoft said in an interview. 'There would have to be a reduction all over - and a reduction in living standards. We have a high level of ambition on social services, but it depends on growth.' The return to growth over the past year has produced a surge in new jobs, leading the finance ministry to predict that the unemployment 'curve' will at last begin to turn down. It forecasts that unemployment will fall below 11 per cent next year to around 10.5 per cent. Its aim is for the creation of 215,000 new jobs between this year and 2000, reducing unemployment (coincidentally) to the same level of 215,000, or between 7 and 8 per cent of the workforce. Mr Lykketoft emphasises that the new jobs must come from the private sector. He has already introduced cuts in income taxes, shifting the burden in the direction of indirect 'green taxes' on energy, water and packaging. He is committed to keeping the public finances and inflation under strict control. The government is looking at measures to increase the obligation on the unemployed to take up vacancies. Above all, when it comes to labour-market measures, it is seeking to upgrade skill and qualification levels within the workforce, aiming for high-skill, high-wage jobs to solve unemployment, rather than low-skill, low-wage jobs. However, many economists and industrialists question whether the government's strategy will succeed. They say that most of the jobless - more than 75 per cent - who are long-term unemployed are not susceptible to significant skill enhancement. They strongly criticise schemes such as the controversial 'leave from work' programme - which allows employees state-subsidised time off for retraining, parental leave or sabbatical leave  -as an indulgence which risks causing labour bottlenecks and, ultimately, inflation. Critics argue that, instead, there should be a thorough overhaul of the welfare benefits and labour market systems to price people into work. With the minimum wage at DKr67 an hour and maximum unemployment benefits at DKr132,000 year, they say the basic incentive to work is lacking for many. 'Nowhere in the world can you find a system where people can continue on benefits at such a level that the wages they would receive for a job are lower,' says Mr Poul Erik Petersen, head of the Danish Employers Association. But for the time being at least, the government is committed to a path that does not alter the fundamental structure of the existing labour and welfare system. 'There is more or less a consensus in Denmark that we should not put adult Danes on lower minimum wages,' says Mr Lykketoft. 'That means we are excluding some kinds of job, but they are not the main road to increased employment. The ambition is to give people more qualifications to give the possibility of jobs at higher levels.'</p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Labour looks for a leader Labour's leadership contest will be gripping for reasons beyond a sporting interest in the fate of well-known politicians. The winner will take over a party well ahead in the opinion polls, following a selection process democratised to the point that it is rather like the primaries of the United States. Just as those produce potential presidents, so the Labour primary will produce a potential prime minister. It is therefore remarkable that the party has so far conducted itself with such uncharacteristic restraint. Potential candidates have been asked not to declare their hands until June 10, the day after the European elections. That leaves 40 days for open canvassing before the results are announced on July 21. This has not prevented anyone from campaigning behind the scenes, but the delay of a few weeks before the contest formally begins may be salutary. It has encouraged most supporters of the aspirants to conduct themselves with decorum. The electorate may be spared the dogfights that attended the selection of Mr James Callaghan and Mr Neil Kinnock. This is a credit both to the legacy of party unity left by the late Mr John Smith and to the competence of the acting leader, Mrs Margaret Beckett. Mrs Beckett has also persuaded the party's national executive to call a concurrent contest for the deputy leadership, a post she won in tandem with Mr Smith. She will therefore attract votes for apparently putting party before self. This should all but guarantee her re-election as deputy leader, and win her some support for the idea that she herself should be the new leader, should she enter the fray. The contest, and the debate on the party's future, is wide open. Blair ahead It is a debate that should be pursued with vigour. Various polls have confirmed that Mr Tony Blair is the most popular of the undeclared candidates. His lead is deserved, but it would be wrong to arrange a mere coronation. Mr Blair is insufficiently tested in the heat of close-fought battle. He has stood his ground for a radical view of trade union law, he has brought credibility to Labour's stance on crime and he has worked hard to identify an underpinning theme for Labour, based upon the maximum freedom for individuals within the framework of shared community interests. Little, however, is known of his approach to industrial, financial, or economic policy, not to mention topics such as foreign affairs and defence. Nor has Mr Blair ever moved into the open with views about the potential for collaboration between Labour and the Liberal Democrats. True debate A potential prime minister need not be possessed of detailed prescriptions for every problem, but he or she does need clear indication of the positions of principle from which to start every discussion of government action. On too many issues, it is unclear where Labour stands. Has it resolved its internal differences? Is it as free of excessive trade union influence as, say, the German social democrats, or the US Democratic party? What kind of European vision will it pursue? Where does it define the limits of the state? These and other questions must be addressed in the leadership contest. Labour needs the adrenalin of true policy debate, if it is to excite voters rather than stand as the passive recipient of their contempt for a divided Conservative party. The candidates have been listed as of the left or right persuasion, or the traditionalist or moderniser wing of the party. Such labels can be useful, but they do not cover the complexity of the personalities involved. As shadow chancellor Mr Gordon Brown has sought to rid the party of its ancient penchant for devaluation, high taxation and high spending. Yet he still speaks as if he were a traditionalist with roots in the old left. Mr Robin Cook is a candidate of the left, but his clever wit and sharp tongue can give his pronouncements a market flavour. Mr John Prescott is a traditionalist who enjoys mocking the modernisers. If Mr Blair is to win both the leadership and a subsequent general election he must demonstrate that he has a substantial, modernising vision, alongside the courage to take risks. And he must carry the party with him. Labour will serve no one's interest if it elects only a telegenic front man.</p>

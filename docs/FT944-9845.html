			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / People (Names in the News): Jardines recruits locally in Manila The Philippine branch of Jardine Matheson has a reputation as a training ground for future Taipans of the 132-year-old Hong Kong trading giant, writes Jose Galang. Alasdair Morrison, Jardine's current managing director, once worked there, as did his predecessor, Nigel Rich, who now runs Trafalgar House. Percy Weatherall, the boss of Hongkong Land, and Simon Michel, another senior Jardine figure, also learnt their trade in Jardine's Manila office on Buendia Avenue. Hence the surprise at the appointment of Aloysius Borja Colayco, 44, as head of Jardine Davies, the group's locally-quoted subsidiary. Not only is he the first Filipino to lead the group but he has been brought in from outside and given the job of chairman and chief executive. Although a few other foreign multinationals such as Shell and Caltex have had Filipino chief executives, it is a big departure for Jardines and suggests that it is intent on revitalising one of the sleepier parts of its far-flung trading empire. Colayco is not the most obvious candidate to run a business whose activities range from traditional sugar milling to merchant banking, insurance broking, construction materials, and hotel operations. Most of his career has been spent working in the international insurance industry. He was president of New York-based AIG Investment Corporation, which manages AIG's investment portfolios in Europe, Asia, Latin America and other regions outside north America. However, Colayco is not a complete stranger. In 1980 he joined Jardine Davies as assistant treasurer and was transferred a year later to the group's head office in Hong Kong before moving to be chief investment officer of Philippine American Life Insurance, part of AIG, the US insurance giant. Jardine's decision to poach him back suggests that - in the unlikely event of Jardine choosing an Asian Taipan - Colayco would have to feature as a contender.</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Lib Dems call for voters to have greater influence CITIZENS' initiatives giving people a direct voice in decision-making is at the heart of Liberal Democrat plans yesterday aimed at popularising constitutional reform. The proposal would mean that a certain proportion of the voters could force a referendum on a policy that the local council or national government was refusing to implement. Elected bodies would, however, be able to override opinions expressed in referendums. Another proposal would enable up to one third of ministers in a severely slimmed-down executive to come from outside either house of parliament. This is aimed at tackling voters' disenchantment with the political establishment. The policy paper, Here We Stand, also draws together familiar Liberal Democrat themes: a written constitution, home rule for Scotland and Wales, regional parliaments in England, proportional representation, and an elected second chamber. The written constitution which accompanies the paper raises the prospect of the entire Commons, rather than only those within the largest party, electing the prime minister. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, called the plans 'the first serious attempt by any political party in Britain to involve millions more people in the decisions which affect their lives'. He said that political institutions were at 'a new low' in people's esteem after the 'shambles' of the Maastricht debate.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Andrew Lorenz: "British Jostle for 1bn Pound S </F> Africa Defence Deals"]    [Text] British Aerospace [BAe] and three UK shipbuilders --  Swan Hunter, GEC [General Electric Company] and Vosper  Thornycroft -- are pushing for defence-equipment orders from  South Africa worth up to 1 billion pounds. Rapid progress in  negotiations is expected when the United Nations arms embargo  against South Africa is lifted after this week's elections.    BAe has strong prospects of securing the sale of well over  20  Hawk trainer-fighter aircraft, ultimately worth more than 500m  pounds. Any deal could involve initial exports from Britain,  followed by local manufacture in South Africa. An alternative  would be for all the manufacturing to be carried out in South  Africa under licence. BAe and Denel, the South African defence  manufacturer, are understood to have been in talks for months  about a Hawk purchase.    Swan Hunter, GEC's Yarrow subsidiary in Glasgow and  Southampton-based Vosper are battling for a near-450m pound  order for up to six corvettes. Victory for Swan Hunter would  secure the survival of the Tyneside yard. CMN [Maritime  Shipping Company], a French shipbuilder, is in negotiations to  buy Swan. In the past, both Vosper and GEC have expressed an  interest in the company.    South Africa wants the small warships to modernise its navy,  which has been run down during the years of the embargo under UN  Resolution 558. The resolution is widely expected to be  repealed soon atter the elections. The British government has  cleared the way for both Hawk and corvette deals by inviting  Denel's Atlas Aviation subsidiary to bid for the 2 billion pound  contract for a new British army attack helicopter.    Atlas is offering its Rooivalk helicopter and has teamed up  with Marshall Aerospace of Cambridge which would assemble the  aircraft if it wins the competition. Rival bidders include  Westland with McDonnell Douglas's Apache, GEC with the Amencan  Cobra helicopter, and BAe with the Franco-German Eurocopter.    The government move emerged in a written parliamentary  answer  by Jonathan Aitken, the defence-procurement minister and is  conditional on the UN arms embargo being lifted.    It has given a big fillip to BAe, which has been in contact  with the South African air force about a possible Hawk sale for  two years. The Hawk 100 and Hawk 200 models are widely regarded  as the best trainer-fighters in the world, and would replace  South Africa's Impala two-seat trainers, which are made by Atlas.    The form of a deal, involving substantial local manufacture  would be similar to a BAe contract with South Korea, agreed two  years ago and worth about 1.7 billion pounds. Most of the Hawks  will be built in South Korea after export of an initial tranche  from Britain.    A BAe-Atlas deal could open the way to further Hawk sales in  southern Africa. Zimbabwe already operates the original Hawk 60  jet and might want to buy a newer model.    John Weston, head of BAe's defence subsidiary, has forecast  that the company will win orders for up to 400 Hawks worth 7  billion pounds during this decade. Apart from South Africa and  long-established prospects in Saudi Arabia and India BAe has  high hopes of selling to Australia and Singapore. The order  prospects were revealed last month in a briefing to City  analysts by Rolls-Royce, whose Adour engine powers the aircraft.</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Sterling still depressed Sterling's weakness in the wake of Tuesday's interest rate cut continued yesterday as it tested an 11-month low against the dollar, writes Philip Gawith. The UK currency continued to look vulnerable, trading as low as Dollars 1.4545, although it staged a late afternoon recovery to end in London at Dollars 1.4615, marginally up from its Wednesday close of Dollars 1.4605. Volumes, however, were much lower than on Wednesday and trading steadier. Elsewhere, market attention was focused on Washington where last minute trade talks took place ahead of today's planned trade summit between President Clinton and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister. Sterling has not managed to shake off the negative sentiment attached to Tuesday's rate cut. Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW, said an additional factor preying on sentiment was the comparison being drawn between the contrasting UK and US interest rate changes in spite of fairly similar inflation backgrounds. He said spare capacity was a crucial determinant of inflationary pressure and it was not clear that the gap between the two countries was that large. Also weighing down the pound was the relative strength of the D-Mark across the board. Sterling finished in London at DM2.5625, down from a previous DM2.5708 close. This represents a fall of nearly five pfennigs from the UK currency's level before the rate cut. It has now retraced all the gains it made against the D-Mark in the new year. Sterling's trade weighted value finished at 80.8, unchanged from Wednesday evening. A Reuters survey of 20 City economists showed that 60 per cent felt the cut came at the wrong time. Half felt the authorities' justification for reducing rates was incomplete and unconvincing. The dollar ended slightly firmer against the yen yesterday at Y108.450, compared with Y107.845 on Wednesday. It declined against the D-Mark, however, closing at DM1.7534 after a previous DM1.7603. The US currency finished New York trading at Y108.25 and DM1.7533. Analysts said that for the dollar to appreciate further the market needed to see an interest rate cut from the Bundesbank. Failing that, the settlement of the IG Metall wage talks or the release of German M3 data might give the D-Mark new direction. Trade on the yen/dollar cross remained uncertain ahead of today's summit. Some comfort that there might be a meeting of minds came after Mr Tsutomu Hata, the Japanese foreign minister, met US trade representative Mr Mickey Kantor. After emerging from talks, Mr Hata commented: 'Both of us are determined to come up with an agreement.' This optimism was dampened yesterday evening when a senior US Administration official was quoted as saying the odds were running 'pretty high' against a trade deal ahead of the summit. 'We are pretty far apart on everything,' the official was quoted as saying. The market access talks will focus on four sectors: cars and car parts, insurance, and procurement of telecommunications equipment and medical equipment. Dealers said the yen was hard to trade in the short term as it was beset by uncertainties about the strength of the government and the long-running trade policy dispute with the US. Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan, said a number of investors were, as a result, taking flat (neutral) positions on the yen. With no fresh economic data to give the market direction, the EMS grid went through another day of little activity. The Italian lira, the week's best performing currency, remained firm, closing at L964.5 per D-Mark. The lira has risen almost 4 per cent in six weeks since starting the year near the L1,000 level. Mr Persaud cited the lira's performance as evidence of the progressive decoupling of the performance of the high yielding European currencies, such as the lira and the Spanish peseta, from the so-called 'hard-core' ERM currencies, such as the French and Belgian francs. By contrast with the lira, the French franc continued to struggle to progress against the D-Mark, trading around the FFr3.40 level where it has been since late December. Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW, said technical indicators suggested that the franc had lost momentum. Should a resurgent dollar dissuade the Bundesbank from cutting rates, this would 'raise the question again of the sustainability of European policy'. The market obtained no guidance from the Bank of France's newly independent monetary policy council, which met for the fourth time but issued no statement about its deliberations. The Bank of England provided the UK money market with help for the day of Pounds 1.444bn. This compared with its forecast of a Pounds 1.55bn liquidity shortage, revised from an earlier Pounds 1.5bn. The market was fairly liquid, reflected in money market rates falling to 3 1/2 per cent before picking up later to 6 1/4 per cent. Outright assistance was provided at an interest rate of 5 1/8 per cent, while the Bank bought Pounds 1.2bn of bills for resale to the market at an interest rate of 5 5/32 per cent.</p>

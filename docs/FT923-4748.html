			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Insurance result pleases A COMPOSITE insurance sector already reflecting some recovery in investor confidence was boosted by interim figures above expectations and an encouraging statement from Sun Alliance. Analysts reworked full-year estimates for the group and are now likely to predict much lower losses than in their earlier forecasts, which ranged from deficits of Pounds 115m to Pounds 165m. The half-year loss of Pounds 97.9m, against last time's Pounds 114m deficit, surprised many specialists. The shares, which dropped to 214p earlier this year, surged ahead on the figures to close 31 higher at 253p after heavy turnover of 7.2m. Mr Youssef Ziai, insurance analyst at Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, described Sun Alliance as 'the pick of the composite insurance sector' and added: 'Improvements in operating results will negate the impact of mortgage indemnity losses by 1994.' He expects a loss for the year of Pounds 140m, compared with last year's Pounds 466m loss. Rolls-Royce weak Disappointing interim results put the skids under Rolls-Royce shares yesterday, sending them into retreat against a strong market as brokers weighed in with heavy downgradings of estimates for the full-year figures. The aero-engine and turbines group reported half-time profits of Pounds 20m, at the bottom of City forecasts, with a weak dollar cited as an important factor in the figures. At the day's worst the stock was down 9 at 123p. However, the strong market trend later helped to lift the shares off the bottom and they ended 4 off at 128p, with turnover reaching an impressive 11m. Long-term bear Mr Mustapha Omar at Williams de Broe was sufficiently dismayed by the interim figures to trim his already low full-year estimate by a further Pounds 8m to Pounds 80m, a figure now pencilled in by many other analysts. Reckitt volatile Healthcare and household products group Reckitt &amp; Colman saw volatile trading on the back of its announcement of first-half results. Interim profits of Pounds 134.2m, up from Pounds 127.6m, were in line with expectations and the shares showed a gain of 17 at best. However, analysts returned from their meeting with Reckitt feeling very depressed about prospects for the company and shaved forecasts to between Pounds 255m and Pounds 265m for the current year and Pounds 270 to Pounds 290m for 1993. The stock reversed its gain to show a net fall of 7, but then recovered with the general surge to close 4 up on the day at 533p. Ladbroke activity Strong two-way business in Ladbroke saw volume rise to 14m shares, the highest this year, after the company reported interim profits of Pounds 103.2m - up from Pounds 98.2m and in line with market forecasts - as well as an increased dividend. The stock closed 3 up at 151p. Analysts at Smith New Court, which is positive on the stock, said: 'With a 10 per cent yield, Ladbroke is paying the investor to back it as a recession recovery play.' An increased payout from Burmah Castrol was welcomed and the shares rose sharply well before the rest of the market, and by the close were 26 higher at 571p. Mr Nick Clayton, oil analyst at Smith New Court, said the shares 'deserve at least a market multiple at this stage of the cycle and are still a buy'. Mr Keith Morris, at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, labelled the stock a 'strong buy' and said the results 'underline the quality of Burmah's businesses in the teeth of the recession'. The rise in the dollar helped the oil majors, BP adding 5 1/2 at 201p and Shell 10 at 469p. Enterprise Oil, however, slipped 4 more to 320p on fears of further institutional selling. Sun Alliance's interim results and the statement from its chief executive of an improving trend in all its sectors instilled some confidence into other insurance stocks. Commercial Union, the biggest UK composite in terms of market capitalisation, jumped 16 to 471p. Legal &amp; General, badly affected by mortgage indemnity losses, took heart from the Sun Alliance news and advanced 15 to 306p. Insurance brokers, reliant on dollar earnings, were given a substantial fillip by the sharp rally in the dollar, CE Heath rising 12 to 238p and Willis Corroon 4 to 159p. A resurgence of confidence and recovery in the dollar helped the pharmaceutical sector, which has strong exposure to dollar earnings. Stocks were also boosted by individual factors. Glaxo moved ahead 28 to 746p following solid gains in the US overnight. The shares had traded actively in New York on short-covering ahead of a US Food and Drug Administration meeting yesterday to discuss increased use of the company's anti-nausea treatment Zofran, which accounts for about 25 per cent of Glaxo's income. Wellcome bounced 29 to 832p as worries over the US holding faded. A belief that US investors held 10 per cent of the group's shares was hit by a Bank of New York announcement that 7 per cent was held in the form of American Depositary Receipts. But agency broker James Capel was telling clients yesterday that this figure ignored a further 2 to 3 per cent held as UK shares. SmithKline Beecham put on 22 at 469p after US group Genelabs Technologies said it and SmithKline had formed a collaboration for the development and sale of a hepatitis vaccine. With the threat of a rise in domestic interest rates now seen as significantly reduced for the short term at least, many housebuilders were chased higher. Wilson Bowden rose 20 to 246p after announcing marginally higher than expected interim profits. George Wimpey, however, remained under pressure, closing 4 lower at 79p, as dealers fretted about a possible cut in the dividend. Franco-British paper group Arjo Wiggins Appleton was one of the few Footsie companies to lose ground. The shares dipped 6 to 206p as an investor sold stock through Arjo's broker, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Turnover was heavy at 6.9m shares, with a block of 2.5m placed at 197p just before the close of trading. There was also said to be switching from Arjo into Bowater, which announced a healthy rise in interim profits the previous day. Bowater added 15 at 754p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (15).

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Hopes of multilateral steel agreement dashed - Differences make pact impossible by deadline Hopes of negotiating a Multilateral Steel Agreement by the Uruguay Round deadline of December 15 have been dashed by irreconcilable differences between the US and the European Union. Sir Leon Brittan, the EU trade commissioner, and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, yesterday agreed to zero tariffs on steel, which had previously been made conditional on an MSA deal, and to continue MSA negotiations into next year. Zero tariffs for steel were seen by the EU as essential in securing a balanced tariff package with the US. The MSA would have eliminated tariff and non-tariff barriers to steel trade over 10 years and outlawed production subsidies. But the 36-nation talks failed to resolve differences over allowable subsidies and the extent to which US anti-dumping and anti-subsidy actions should be curbed. The MSA was conceived as a replacement for voluntary restraints by the EU and other leading steel exporters to the US market. The voluntary agreement expired in March 1992. Almost immediately afterwards, the US steel industry filed a series of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy suits. Although most of these were rejected, the move has bedevilled talks ever since. The EU and others have sought to have existing duties lifted and to obtain guarantees against future trade harassment, including a pledge by the US not to take action against subsidies paid out before the MSA came into effect. However, the US has refused to accept restraints on the right of US industry to petition against allegedly unfair subsidies, even the few specifically allowed by the draft MSA for environmental improvements, plant closure, retraining, and research and development. Washington still hopes for a MSA deal early next year, before Congress votes on the Uruguay Round results. If these negotiations fail, steel subsidies will be governed by the separate draft Uruguay Round subsidies accord. This lays down in general terms which subventions are prohibited, which are permissible and which are allowed but can be challenged by anti-subsidy suits. In a parallel development, the draft subsidies accord has also been accepted as the basis for a revised voluntary code of fair trade practice for civil aircraft. However, the US and EU are still wrangling over details of the proposed code, which is intended to generalise their bilateral deal on state supports for Airbus. The EU, as in steel, wants to ensure that the US cannot challenge past subsidies while the US is trying to keep subsidies to a minimum.</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Bennett &amp; Fountain falls into red BENNETT &amp; Fountain, the electrical group, swung into losses in the year to end-June as the recession took its toll on the building and construction sectors. Pre-tax losses - after redundancy costs of Pounds 607,000 and a reduced interest charge of Pounds 1.61m (Pounds 2.46m) - were Pounds 3.55m, against profits of Pounds 2.31m last year. Turnover, which included Pounds 13.6m from discontinued operations, fell to Pounds 61.4m (Pounds 74.1m). Losses per share were 3.2p (earnings 2.2p). The company said that because of the substantial deficit on the profit and loss reserve there would be no final dividend on either the ordinary or preference shares. A number of branches were disposed of in November, and an extraordinary item of Pounds 3.84m represents the results of these operations.</p>

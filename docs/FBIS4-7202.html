			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Newly appointed  Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Mutsuki Kato, a  veteran legislator of the House of Representatives, is known for  his expertise on tax and financial policies.    Kato, 67, a member of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party),  replaced Eijiro Hata of the same party. He left the Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) last year to join the coalition's  mainstream conservative and the LDP's breakaway party Shinseito,  which was founded by Tsutomu Hata, new prime minister, and  Ichiro Ozawa, the alliance's primary strategist.    Kato is known to be close to Ozawa.    In the LDP, Kato held such ministerial portfolios as Land  Agency, Hokkaido Development Agency and agriculture. He formed  his own group in 1991 after seceding from a major LDP faction  led by Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, a veteran legislator who has held the  posts of foreign, trade and transport ministers.    Kato also headed the LDP's Policy Affairs Council and  Research Council on Tax System.    On political realignment, Kato shares a similar view with  Ozawa, who is urging a two-party system, in which a unity party  of coalition blocs rivals the LDP.    Kato, hailing from Okayama Prefecture, western Japan, has  been elected to the powerful House of Representatives ten times.</p>

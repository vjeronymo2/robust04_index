The remedy  prescribed by Wu Wenying, chairman of the China Textile  Federation, on the basis of several days of serious and lively  discussion at the conference was: Take the initiative to adjust  and deepen reforms.    Textiles is one of our country's oldest traditional  industries as well as one which moved toward the market early.  The abolition of clothing coupons in 1983 was a turning point.  To the majority of consumers, it marked the end once and for  all of an era of insufficient clothing. To the textile  industry, it marked the entry of a period of adjustment and  improvement. "Watering flowers with water pumps used previously  for large fields"--from this we can imagine the difficulty of  the adjustment. Due to specific historical reasons in the  transition from the old to a new system, the adjustment and  improvement of the industry did not unfold smoothly. This, plus  excessive burdens on traditional enterprises, led to years of  increasing costs for a textile industry which was once was a  great "money earner," and years of falling annual profits and  taxes. Some industries, such as cotton spinning, have been  losing money since 1991, that is, for the last three years.    The year 1993 was extremely difficult for the textile  industry. Nationwide, 12 million textile workers worked  unceasingly, recovering 9.45 billion out of 11.7 billion yuan in  profit reductions, but still failed to halt the trend of sliding  economic efficiency. A quarter of national production capacity  lay idle or semi-inactive, and 2 million workers had no work or  were waiting for employment. But the year was not totally grim.  The textile industry in Shanghai adjusted to market demand,  increased its efforts at industrial adjustment, and achieved  notable results, giving delegates a glimmer of hope of  revitalizing the textile industry in these difficult times.    Last year, big cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Qingdao  took the initiative in adjusting their production structures and  cutting primary processing capacity. Jiangsu Province has  quickened the pace of switching primary processing capacity in  cotton spinning from the south of the province to the northern  cotton-producing region. Through switching production lines and  developing tertiary industry, Shanghai Municipality cut its  cotton spinning production capacity by 230,000 spindles and its  work force by 110,000. The development of differential land  rents in the last year reaped 740 million yuan. Meanwhile, many  enterprises were approved as joint- stock companies,  shareholding companies with group shareholders, and shareholding  cooperative firms; there were active efforts to build a modern  corporate system, strengthen firms' operational powers, and  quicken the pace of upgrading the industry.    "Experience from localities proves that adjustment must be  unified with reform for any breakthroughs in thinking and  seizing the initiative." Wu Wenying put forward this line of  thinking and work focuses for this year's textile reforms: One,  the textile industry is a competitive industry. From a  long-term view, enterprises owned exclusively by the state can  only be a minority, while most state-owned large and  medium-sized enterprises must proceed in the direction of  diversified ownership and change traditional large-scale  production and small-scale operations. Two, state-owned textile  enterprises can be reorganized as limited companies or  shareholding cooperative enterprises, or they can be contracted  out, leased, or rented to collectives or individuals for  operations. Three, actively encourage and promote state-owned  enterprises to reorganize, integrate, or switch to other  industries in structural innovation, and support successfully  performing enterprises' efforts to develop large capital-linked  business conglomerates engaged in cross-regional, inter-trade,  and diversified production and operations in order to promote  structural adjustment and strengthen competitiveness in  international markets.    "Do things according to market laws"--with this loud slogan  adjustment in the textile industry has entered a new year.</p>

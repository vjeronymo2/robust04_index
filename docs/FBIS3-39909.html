Mr. Khan had been  invited to a roundtable organized by the European Socialist  Deputies' Group. A Western intelligence service had been  informed of this visit, passed on the information to the Belgian  Criminal Investigation Department, which passed it on to the  gendarmerie. Although Mr. Khan had a Pakistani passport and a  visa issued by our embassy in Islamabad, he was reported to  Interpol by India, which accused him of heading a terrorist  group.    The case caused a sensation at the time but, after two  months  of detention, Amanullah Khan was expelled by the Belgian  Government to Pakistan. Case closed?    Not really. A few days ago a letter -- the existence of  which had been kept a close secret until now -- written on  behalf of the JKLF and apparently signed by Mr. Khan, reached  Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene. Its author demands, in the  name of the JKLF, the payment of compensation of $10 million  (350 million Belgian francs) for the arbitrary detention which  Mr. Khan suffered in Belgium. If this sum is not quickly paid  into a bank account in Rawalpindi (Pakistan), the author of the  letter states that the JKLF militants will regard Belgium as a  hostile country.    According to information from reliable sources, this letter  did reach the prime minister's residence (which has said: "no  comment") and was passed on to the Criminal Investigation  Department and to the Joint Forces Antiterrorist Group (GIA).  It is being taken very seriously, although its authenticity  cannot be guaranteed.    Indeed, Belgian analysts think that, for various reasons,  the  arrest and subsequent release of Amanullah Khan generated only  anger and frustration among all those involved in this case:  The JKLF and its president, Pakistan and India, the United  States (which has a great influence in that region of the  world), some European Socialists, and several intelligence  services. It is therefore not impossible, analysts think, that  this letter is a forgery by one of these parties and is aimed at  reviving tension by bringing the Khan case back into the news  (through the media). In other words, whether genuine or a  forgery, the "Khan letter" is still important and significant.    Does this mean that there is really a threat of attacks on  Belgium? "No, not really," the intelligence services say, "at  least not at present."    However, one thing is certain: Jean-Luc Dehaene does not  intend to pay the 350 million Belgian francs into the account  indicated by his correspondent.</p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Arts: Lovely space, shame about the content - William Packer reviews 'Young British Artists II' at the Saatchi gallery It is a pleasure to visit the Saatchi Collection, to pass through those heavy grey steel doors into that bare, white courtyard, with its blind turn down to the left - just the way a latter-day Cocteau would lead us down again into the Underworld. Don't look back. Through another blank grey door into the clear lobby and still the place keeps its secrets. Only when we turn to the right, and step down into a vast, whiter, brighter space, does the full shock of the place strike us like a blow. We are in what is not only one of the largest and most beautiful exhibition spaces that I know, but also, perhaps, the most remarkable. To enter it is not merely to see it, but actually to feel it, with a palpable frisson of sensibility. Workshop or whatever before its conversion, it is now the perfect place for showing art, or showing anything. A Rembrandt, a bowl of fruit, a pair of legs or a bicycle wheel would look as well in that sharply focused, undistracted and celebratory light. Here perhaps lies the problem, for to celebrate is not always to discriminate. And what of the art? Four young British artists are in this latest show. They share no common interest or practice, yet there is a certain character in common, that says rather more about their imaginative conditioning than about the particular nature of their work. In each case, the idea, the concept, comes first, with the means of its expression or realisation merely a secondary and technical, in the case of the sculptors, highly technical consideration. The work does not change and develop its process. The artist does not respond intuitively and directly to what is happening under his hand. There is no sense of discovery or surprise, of the artist doing more than he imagined, going so much further than he anticipated. All is organised, thoroughly professional. Sarah Lucas finds her imagery in the tabloid press at its most flagrantly extreme, in its pandering to carnal appetite and its particular treatment of women as sexual objects. The chosen images are amplified by photocopy and collaged onto large canvases with but little other intervention on the her part. She also shows assortments of objects set out on tables, of ambiguous but evidently potent significance. She is operating, we are told, 'as an aesthetic terrorist, pillaging mainstream culture . . . monitoring the sexism and misogyny routinely found there.' Rose Finn-Kelcey offers two quasi-industrial installations, one warm, one cool. A refrigerated cabinet, large enough to walk into, contains an object like a small sentry-box or up-ended coffin made entirely of ice-cubes. And, in a darkened side-gallery, steam rises from a broad metal base to the matching ventilator hood above, a swirling, untidy mass of vapour caught in the spotlight. For the artist thus to be intrigued by evanescent material is not in itself unreasonable, for art is ever teased by the fleeting moment, experience caught even as it passes. Here she has yet to move beyond the merely technological demonstration - an ice-box preserved in an ice-box: the production and containment of a cloud of steam. Marc Quinn has poured some nine pints of his own blood into a mould taken of his own head, after the normal method of the life-cast, and which he now preserves in the refrigerator as his frozen self-portrait, as permanent as the power supply. A life-cast is, well, a life-cast, a purely technical exercise that involves no modelling nor self-scrutiny whatever, but only a degree of practical care. The only point that might raise the piece above the banal is that it is made of blood. It is certainly an arresting if macabre side-show, but is it anything more? 'By casting his own substance in a mould of his own features, Quinn resolves a key sculptural issue - the relationship between form and content.' Hmmmmm. He has also cast series of heads in bronze or lead, that are pastiches upon the baroque virtuosity of a Houdon or a Roubiliac. But who would dare to risk such a comparison too far? Quinn models his heads of Marie-Antoinette or Louis XVI in dough, which rises in the baking and is distorted in the rising, before making his definitive mould. Image without responsibility, the perfect let-out. The pity is that these objects, carried off as they are with some considerable panache and flair, suggest that with a more substantial initial commitment to the modelling, something more substantial might be achieved. Mark Wallinger shows two series of large paintings, one, called 'Race, Class, Sex', of thoroughbreds standing at Sheik Mohammed's stud at Newmarket, the other, 'Capital', of down-and-out characters standing in front of the anonymous brass doors of City banks. The gloss is earnestly correct, in its worrying about bloodlines, the economics of breeding, and the sociology of ownership and the sport itself. The down-and-outs (Wallinger's friends dressed down) present the inevitable contrast between poverty and affluence to an unfeeling world. Oh dear. The pity here is that Wallinger is in prospect a better painter than he allows himself to be with his attitudinising, his 'investigation of the traditional genres of oil-painting', his firing-off at obvious, simple-minded social targets. He does everything from photographs, which is nothing if not a distancing device. He loves horses and racing, but we shall never know it until he begins to respond directly and unselfconsciously to what he sees and feels. It is never the moralising that makes the art. Velasquez painted the Court Dwarfs, as discomfiting a subject as could be imagined. But he painted them as they were, as he saw and knew them, and left them at that. They stand among the greatest images of humanity ever painted.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ferdos Ferudastan: "FDP Does Not Want To Irritate </F> Turkey"]    [Text] Bonn, 27 May -- The Free Democratic Party of  Germany [FDP] Bundestag Group has not agreed to Foreign Minister  Klaus Kinkel's (FDP) proposal to send CSCE observers to Turkey  to study the Kurdish conflict. In an interview with FRANKFURTER  RUNDSCHAU, Ulrich Irmer, the FDP Bundestag Group's foreign  policy spokesman, said that the call for CSCE observers would  make the Turks feel they are "to be brought before the judge"  again. This would irritate Ankara and lessen its willingness to  negotiate. That is why the Bundestag group has decided against  a Bundestag motion calling for observers, as had been suggested  by the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD].    Talking to FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU three weeks ago, Kinkel had  called for CSCE observers to be sent to Turkey.    Irmer said that, instead of criticizing [Turkey] "in the  open  market" by calling for observers, the Turkish Government should  be persuaded to change its line toward the Kurds and its human  rights policy by means of talks within the CSCE and the Council  of Europe. In such internal talks, the Turkish Government tends  to show "goodwill and thoughtfulness"; but it "simply does not  have its own army under control any more."    As a result of that, the Kurdish identity of people in  southeast Turkey is disputed, and they are refused the rights of  an ethnic minority. Irmer said that the fight against the  Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK) "is an enormous strain on the  civilian population." Ankara's attempt at solving the Kurdish  problem by military means is "unsuitable." The FDP group's  foreign policy spokesman does not share Kinkel's view that the  human rights situation in Turkey has deteriorated. "I do not  have any indication" of that, Irmer said. The FDP politician  said that the German delegation might try putting Turkey's  Kurdish policy on the agenda of the CSCE conference of  parliamentarians to be held in Vienna in early July.</p>

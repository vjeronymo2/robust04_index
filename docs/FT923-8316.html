			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canada's high-cost coal mines feel the pinch - Bernard Simon describes desperate efforts to improve efficiency and competitiveness AFTER another, western Canada's coal mines are confronting the painful reality that high-cost producers usually suffer the heaviest casualties in an over-supplied market. Financial restructuring, labour confrontation, pleas for lower taxes and protracted negotiations with suppliers are the order of the day in British Columbia, as the coal producers seek to improve their competitiveness by bringing down costs. 'There's a future only for a mine operating at absolute maximum efficiency,' says Mr Jim Gardiner, president of Fording Coal, whose mine in south-east British Colombia has been shut by a strike since early May. Fording, which was hoping to ship 6.3m tonnes of coking coal this year, has demanded that its workers accept management's right to do business with non-union contractors. Westar Mining's Balmer mine, which is among Canada's biggest coal exporters, has also been closed by a labour dispute for the past three months. Another property, Line Creek, changed hands earlier this year, and the future of several other mines is uncertain. The province's seven major coal producers suffered their biggest losses ever last year, with a combined shortfall from operations of CDollars 62m (Pounds 27m) and write-offs totalling another CDollars 160m. The adjustment process has progressed furthest at the Quintette mine in the north-east corner of the province. Quintette, which was a showpiece of Canadian resources policy when it opened eight years ago, was pushed to the brink of bankruptcy in the late 1980s by high costs, a heavy debt burden and the unremitting squeeze on prices. But a financial restructuring (which left a group of banks as sizeable minority shareholders) enabled the mine to emerge from court protection earlier this year. With the help of a change in management, Quintette has so far succeeded in bringing down its costs by even more than its owners expected. The labour force has shrunk by 20 per cent in the past 12 months. While strike-bound Balmer and Fording have declared force majeure on their export contracts, Quintette is now shipping coal at a record pace to Japanese steel mills. The mine is currently exporting over 400,000 tonnes a month, and its stocks will have dwindled to 8,000 tonnes by the end of August. Quintette has now been overtaken by Westar as the industry's most critically ill patient. The Vancouver-based company, with debts of about CDollars 400m, applied for court protection from its creditors in early June. Mr Peter Dolazel, Westar's president, says the company has enough cash to last till the end of September, and has put together a restructuring plan which, in his words, 'we believe is workable'. Westar's smaller Greenhills mine is understood to be still operating normally and profitably. Besides debt relief, Westar needs at least CDollars 75m for a new pit at Balmer. The mine's existing seam has only seven or eight years of reserves, and costs are high. The difficult mining conditions pushed Balmer's output down to 5.4m tonnes last year, from 5.6m tonnes in 1990. A financial restructuring is necessary for Balmer but would not be sufficient to save the mine. The leaders of the United Mine Workers local branch have a reputation for being among the most intransigent trade unionists in the North American mining industry. They rejected the recommendation by a government-appointed panel last month that the management's latest package should be put to a secret, union-supervised vote among their 1,300 members. According to Mr Dolazel, several hundred workers have signed a petition in recent days demanding a vote. Westar's most immediate problem however, is to hang on to its board. Seven of its nine directors, including the chairman, have quit over concerns that they might be held personally liable in law for severance payments to workers while Westar is under bankruptcy protection. A British Columbian Supreme Court judge last week refused Westar's application to provide security for the liability of the three remaining directors. The three are now considering whether, as a last resort, they should put the company into liquidation. The British Columbian coal producers' troubles are being exacerbated by the political and economic environment. A labour-backed government, which took office in British Columbia last September, has expressed sympathy for the industry. But in the words of one senior mining executive, it 'talks both ways at the same time' by intervening with a never-ending series of review panels, mediators and commissions. On the commercial front, the producers have received a boost this year from a weaker Canadian dollar. But they still face a market that has been over-supplied for almost a decade, and where no respite is in sight as steelmakers try to cut their use of the high-quality metallurgical coal produced in British Columbia. Mr Richard Marshall, a Calgary coal consultant, warned in a report last year that British Columbia's exports of coking coal to Japan could fall from 12.7m tonnes in 1990 to as low as 6.7m tonnes by 2010. Producers have had to accept price reductions from their Japanese customers in each of the past two years. The industry claims that its export prices have plunged by 66 per cent in real terms over the past decade. The mines hope that domestic power-station business will take up some of the slack on the export markets. Fording and Luscar's Coal Valley mine won hard-fought contracts in competition with US producers earlier this year to supply Ontario Hydro. The mines are also pressing for cuts in provincial environmental standards to allow more coal-fired power stations. But the industry's emphasis for the forseeable future is likely to remain on cutting its own costs, and stepping up pressure on other links in the export chain - notably the railways - to become more competitive as well.</p>

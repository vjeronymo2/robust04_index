			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOND PRICES RISE SHARPLY DESPITE STOCK REBOUND  </P> <P> Treasury bond prices rose sharply Tuesday, sustaining most of their large early  gains despite an afternoon rebound in the volatile stock market.  </P> <P> Encouraging signs Tuesday that the Federal Reserve would not drive interest  rates higher to fight inflation, the enemy of fixed-income securities such as  bonds, also boosted the credit market during a hectic trading day.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, the bellwether 30-year issue gained  5/32 point, or $4.69 per $1,000 face value, down from as much as 15/32 point  earlier in the day.  </P> <P> The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, tumbled  to 7.89% from 7.93% late Monday.  </P> <P> "The stock market was the real story," said Steven A. Wood, an economist with  BankAmerica Capital Markets Group in San Francisco.  </P> <P> The rise in Treasury prices followed a pattern established in the Friday the  13th stock market tumble, when bonds rose sharply as investors shifted money  out of stocks as the Dow Jones industrial index fell about 190 points. The long  bond rose about $5 on Monday, after the Dow closed down 26 points.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the Dow index declined as much as 85 points in the morning session  before rebounding to finish the day down 3.69 points.  </P> <P> "Half the gains were sustained and that really was a pretty good performance,"  Wood said of Tuesday's dealings.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was  quoted at 8.688%, up from 8.75% on Monday.  </P> <P> Currency  </P> <P> The dollar finished lower against most major currencies, depressed by Wall  Street's volatility and expectations of lower U.S. interest rates.  </P> <P> The steep morning plunge of more than 80 points in the Dow Jones industrial  index touched off a heavy but brief flurry of dollar sales that subsided once  the stock market started to recover later in the day.  </P> <P> David Jaques, a vice president at Barclays Bank PLC in New York, said currency  dealings were lethargic in the early going, with traders lacking a compelling  reason to buy or sell. News of a 0.1% decline in September orders for U.S.  durable goods created barely a ripple in the currency markets because the  figure virtually matched advance estimates.  </P> <P> The dollar began its trading day in Tokyo with a fall to 142.10 Japanese yen  from 142.40 yen at Monday's close. Later, in London, it declined further to  141.95 yen. It was quoted at 141.50 yen in New York, down from 141.90 yen on  Monday.  </P> <P> In London, the British pound rose to $1.6065 from $1.5945 late Monday. A pound  cost $1.6075 at the end of New York trading, compared to $1.6030 on Monday.  </P> <P> Commodities  </P> <P> Copper futures prices nose-dived for the third straight day, dropping to 2  1/2-month lows on New York's Commodity Exchange on selling fueled by  perceptions of a weakening economy.  </P> <P> On other futures markets, precious metals advanced; stock index futures  retreated in a day of wild trading; grain and soybean futures fell; oil futures  were mixed, and livestock and meat futures were mixed.  </P> <P> Copper futures settled 0.9 cent to 4.6 cents lower, with the contract for  delivery in December down 4.5 cents at $1.151 a pound, its lowest daily close  since Aug. 11.  </P></p>

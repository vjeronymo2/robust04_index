			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. V. Listvin, V. N. Listvin, V. T. Potapov, S. </F> V. Tverdov; UDC 535.8:666/189.211]    [Abstract] A fiber optic accelerometer based on an angular  displacement amplitude sensor is studied. The sensor is based  on a multi-mode lightguide. An accelerometer calibration device  was developed and its spec ifications are examined. The  dependence of the signal to noise ratio on the frequency is  shown. At about 30 Hz, the threshold sensitivity to angular  displacement is about 4X10[.sup]-10[/] rad/Hz[.sup]1/2[/]  and to acceleration, about 10[.sup]-6[/]g/Hz[.sup]1/2[/].  The design and design improvements are outlined. Figures 4;  references 5: 4 Russian, 1 Western.</p>

Some time ago, RDRM  Chairman Gavriil Popov advanced this initiative at the  movement's congress. According to the sources, the Public  Chamber is to be set up to ensure coordination between the  Russian Federation federal executive agencies and public  associations, to draw up presidential and government decisions  on the most important social and political matters taking into  account public opinion, and to create a feedback channel between  public association and state authorities. It is expected that  if the directive is signed the first meeting of the Public  Chamber may take place as early as one of the last 10 days of  February.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Sirotkin and Yuriy Kalashnov: </F> "Belarus and Turkmenistan Analyze Ukraine's Experience"; boxed  item is commentary of Economic Policy Department]    [Text] Last week the monetary systems of Belarus and  Turkmenistan underwent significant adjustments with far from  equal implications for local enterprises and their Russian  contracting partners. In particular, the decision of the  Government of Turkmenistan to resume the trading sessions in the  local currency exchange and to base the official exchange rate  of the manat on their results created the prerequisites for a  better mechanism of mutual settlements between Turkmen and  Russian enterprises. The Belarusian Council of Ministers, on the  other hand, had an extremely adverse effect on the  infrastructure of mutual settlements. The republic government  decided to cover the shortage of currency needed for the  repayment of "gas" debts to Russia by instituting the compulsory  sale of all of the export receipts (including those in Russian  rubles) of Belarusian enterprises directly to the currency  reserve of the National Bank. This eliminated the need for  trading sessions in the local currency exchange, but on Thursday  the decision was amended, although only with respect to joint  ventures, non-residents of Belarus, and firms which had  deposited foreign currency in their accounts prior to 14  March.    The history of the national currency markets of the former  union republics reveals three basic patterns of development,  which could be termed "Baltic," "Russian," and "Ukrainian."  According to the first, the official exchange rate of the  national currency is based on average market indicators and most  exchanges of currency take place in the interbank market. The  stability of national currency is achieved primarily by means of  a stringent monetary policy in this case. The "Russian" pattern  of development presupposes a strong connection between the  official exchange rate of the national currency and current  stock market indicators. The country's main financial agency  (the central or national bank) can influence the currency market  with slight adjustments by pursuing a policy of strictly  scheduled changes in stock exchange quotations. Finally, in the  "Ukrainian" example, the seeming stability of the official  exchange rate of national currency is achieved by means of  flagrant intervention by the national bank or the republic  leadership in trading sessions (by setting strict limits, for  example, on the rise in rates in a single session or by stopping  the session when the rate has reached the necessary level).    The events of last week in the currency markets of  Turkmenistan and Belarus revolved around the "Ukrainian"  pattern. The Government of Turkmenistan took a discerning view  of it and decided that the official exchange rate of the manat,  which had been kept stable for almost half a year while market  quotations had fallen to less than one-thirtieth of the previous  rate, could not enhance the prestige of its currency and resumed  the practice of basing the official exchange rate on the results  of trading sessions. As a result, the official exchange rates of  the manat immediately dropped, from 1.99 to 10.00 manats to the  U.S. dollar and from 600 to 170 rubles to the manat. Although  there is still a sizable gap between the official exchange rates  and the actual market rates, the Turkmen leadership's actions  could have positive implications for local and (and this is much  more important) Russian financial entities. In particular, the  gradual convergence of official and market indicators will do  much to simplify mutual settlements between Russian and Turkmen  enterprises, which have experienced constant difficulties in  defining actual rates of exchange, and the repatriation of  profits. If the Turkmen Government allows local banks to conduct  settlements through their own correspondent accounts, the local  market could become extremely appealing to the Russian entities.    The Belarusian Council of Ministers, on the other hand,  became an involuntary apologist for the "Ukrainian" pattern when  it encountered the need to repay its debts to Russia for  deliveries of energy resources. It passed decrees to institute  the compulsory sale of all of the foreign currency receipts of  local enterprises to the National Bank at the official exchange  rate. The official exchange rates of the dollar and the Russian  ruble were set at 10,200 Belarus rubles to the dollar and 6.61  Belarus rubles to the Russian ruble. It also decided to suspend  trading sessions in the local currency exchange. At the last  minute, however, the Bank of Belarus amended the council's  decision and authorized the sale of foreign currency in the  exchange by joint ventures, non-residents of Belarus, and  enterprises which had deposited the foreign currency in their  accounts prior to 14 March. The Belarusian currency market  reacted to this "double move" immediately and unequivocally--the  exchange rate of the dollar was set at 17,950 Belarus rubles to  the dollar and the rate of the German mark was set at 11,950  Belarus rubles to the mark on Thursday. In this way, the foreign  exchange rates of the Belarusian currency fell to half of the  rate at the beginning of March. The events in Belarus have  already evoked a response from Russia: By the end of the week  most of the Russian financial entities specializing in financial  transfers within the CIS had dramatically reduced the number of  operations with Belarusian contracting partners and had  virtually stopped all mutual settlements.    In spite of the similarities between the situation in  Belarus  and the "Ukrainian" pattern, however, the circumstances in that  republic could change in the future. In contrast to Ukraine,  where the crisis of non-payments had stabilized the exchange  rate of the karbovanets at 25,000-35,000 karbovantsy to the  dollar virtually without being influenced by the decisions of  official government structures, the high level of effective  demand in Belarus provides no hope of quick stabilization.  Therefore, it probably will be impossible to create even the  semblance of government decisions influencing conditions in the  currency market. Besides this, the future of the unified ruble  zone is still not certain: If the currency systems of Russia and  Belarus are merged, the Belarusian market could start developing  according to the Russian pattern instead of the "Ukrainian" one.    [Box]    The development of the currency markets in the republics of  the former USSR is influenced by internal and external factors.  This applies above all to the perturbing effects of Belarusian  currency regulation, which have been officially justified by  Minsk's hope of keeping the idea of unification with the Russian  monetary system afloat, primarily for the purpose of securing  domestic Russian prices for Belarusian consumers of energy  resources. The Draconian currency nationalization (the  100-percent compulsory sale of receipts in rubles and in  convertible currencies at a clearly unrealistic fixed rate) will  urge Belarusian businessmen to move beyond republic borders in  mobilizing resources for settlements with Russia's Gazprom  Association. According to a statement by Vyacheslav Kebich's  press secretary on 15 March, Russia is already willing to lower  its gas prices from 80 to 50 dollars for a thousand cubic meters  of gas. The same statement included the optimistic comment that  the package of unification documents would be signed before the  end of this month.    The actual truncation of the currency market in Belarus,  however, will postpone the decision on another issue of cardinal  importance in connection with monetary unification--the rates  for the conversion of the Belarusian clearing rubles and cash  rubles into Russian rubles. The preferred Russian option (with  consideration for the actual differences between Belarusian cash  and non-cash forms of money) is known to be the establishment of  a single exchange rate, the average of the non-cash market  exchange rate for the dollar and a cash rate based on a  coordinated consumer budget. The effective undermining of the  Belarusian currency market (only currency deposited in the  accounts of exporters prior to 14 March can be sold freely, and  this means that the exchange rate in Minsk will be decided by  the National Bank of Belarus instead of the currency exchange)  leaves room for currency manipulation, which certainly will not  be in Russia's interest. There is also a bigger problem.  Officials in Minsk are reluctant to admit that the unification  of the monetary systems will be meaningless without a unified  budget and credit-emission center and, consequently, without the  surrender of much of Belarus' sovereignty to Moscow.</p>

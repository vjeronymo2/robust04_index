			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Arts: King Henry IV Pt I - Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-Upon-Avon The news from Stratford is decidedly mixed. Robert Stephens makes a charming intellectual out of Falstaff in the new production of King Henry IV Part I, but rather at the expense of the rest of the play. The secret of Stephens's approach to the part is that although his Falstaff is as fat as the text dictates, he is not gross. He drinks a lot of sack, but does not appear to get drunk. He is in control of his faculties throughout. Although he seems seldom to sleep in his own, or indeed any, bed, and never takes a bath, he is remarkably well-groomed. The hair and the beard may be a bit long, but they are not dirty. All told, this Falstaff would be at home as rather a wise QC enjoying himself at the Old Bailey. Stephens not only plays the character well, but adds the extra dimension of Falstaff taking himself off: for example, when he speaks with a slight lisp and introduces an element of sexual camp. Such an interpretation is entirely in line with the text. Falstaff is, after all, the cleverest and wisest man in the play with the possible exception of Prince Hal. What Falstaff has to say about honour is far more intelligent than the rantings and ramblings of a Glendower or a Hotspur. Beside him the English nobility are simply uneducated, or in this production almost anonymous. On Michael Maloney's Hal, the Prince of Wales, we shall have to suspend judgment until we see how he develops in Part II. As an actor, he is physically very small - about half the size of his father, the king, and one quarter the size of Falstaff. That could be an inspired piece of casting, allowing him to grow in stature as he moves towards the crown. For the present, he plainly sees that there is more to Falstaff than obesity: he loves him as a benevolent, if eccentric uncle, but also as someone who has something to teach. Judgment will have to be suspended, too, on Adrian Noble's direction until we see where it leads. So far, it is uneven. Julian Glover's Henry IV is a very Christian king who appears to dislike war in general. This may be a modern touch, which would help to explain why the battle scenes are so ponderously awful. Clearly it must be a deliberate decision to stage them so obviously without excitement. Sometimes it is hard to tell which character is which. Possibly it is meant to illustrate the fog of war. Anyway, Glover speaks his opening lines well and is undeniably upset about the behaviour of his son. It may be that Hal is just as troubled by the behaviour of his father: hence the affection for Falstaff. Afterwards the king does not get much of a showing, which is not his fault. I have high hopes of Rob Edwards's bisexual Poins. It has always seemed one of the most intriguing minor parts in Shakespeare, and it is a pity that he is not allowed more of a role. Sylvestra le Touzel makes a pretty shot at Kate, the wife to Hotspur, and it is fun to see Glendower (Bernard Kay) played as a thoroughly unhumorous Welsh bore. Otherwise the production leaves a lot to be desired.</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Exports boost Shepherd Neame Shepherd Neame, the Kent brewer, reported an 8.6 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.71m to Pounds 5.11m in the year to July 2 as its Bishops Finger and Spitfire brands gained from national distribution and strong export sales, writes Roderick Oram. Turnover advanced 12 per cent from Pounds 39.1m to Pounds 43.8m. Earnings per share were 60.2p (54.4p) and a final proposed dividend of 15p makes a total of 19p (17.5p). The Kent pubs suffered from cross-Channel duty-free imports but any decline was more than offset by strong sales of Bishops Finger in Calais stores, Mr Bobby Neame, chairman, said.</p>

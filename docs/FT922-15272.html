			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Lonrho investors seek debt details LONRHO, the troubled international trading group, is being pressed by some of its largest UK institutional shareholders to divulge information over debt and banking covenants in the wake of the collapse of its share price. Directors will be asked to reveal the amount of debt and in which countries it has been taken out. Mr Rene Leclezio, Lonrho chairman, told shareholders at last month's annual general meeting that net debt stood at Pounds 850m. Shareholders particularly want to know whether this figure has been calculated before or after the Pounds 177m was paid by the Libyans for the one third stake in the Metropole Hotels. Lonrho will also be pressed to give details of its banking covenants or conditions. Only if covenants are breached, can a bank apply the threat that a loan should be repaid immediately. One shareholder said: 'If our information about the group is correct then the shares are seriously undervalued. But in the wake of the fall in the share price we must have up-to-date information for us to make a judgment about whether this is recovery stock or not.' Mr Paul Spicer, Lonrho deputy chairman, refused to comment on the relationship between Lonrho and its institutional shareholders, but added: 'There is nothing to be concerned about. Our debt is easily explained and is being reduced.' Lonrho's shares yesterday recovered a little to close at 71p, following Tuesday's fall to 65 1/2 p, an eight-year low. Last November the shares were worth about 250p. Bankers said yesterday they were concerned about Lonrho's falling share price. However, they are unable to apply much pressure on the company to provide more information to them. Lonrho's main banking facilities contain covenants that are 'almost impossible for the company to breach', according to a banker. Bankers are divided on the merits of the Libyan investment in Lonrho's Metropole Hotels chain. 'At least it is bringing cash into the company', said one. But another criticised the deal which he described as 'strategically wrong'.</p>

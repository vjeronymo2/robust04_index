			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> INDIA CUTS NEPAL OFF FROM WORLD  </P> <P> Nepal's lifelines were almost completely cut today as India closed vital routes  between the landlocked Himalayan nation and the rest of the world as part of a  trade dispute.  </P> <P> Trade and transit treaties between the countries expired Thursday with  negotiations for renewal at an impasse. India, which blames Katmandu for the  problem, today closed all but two of the 13 transit routes on their common  border, Nepali officials said.  </P> <P> Mountainous Nepal, sandwiched between India and China, relies on India for  almost half its total imports and most essential commodities. Although Katmandu  has said there are comfortable reserves of essential commodities, rationing of  kerosene and other basics has already begun.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BANK BAILOUTS  </P> <P> All savings and loan bailout plans to date want to put the burden on the  taxpayer. How about a users fee on all borrowers who take a tax deduction for  interest payments on their federal tax return?  </P> <P> This would include individuals and businesses. A 5% reduction in the amount of  interest allowed as a tax deduction should provide ample funds to replenish  both the FSLIC and the FDIC within a few years.  </P> <P> In addition to being a ready source of funds, it would be easy to collect the  money. The IRS would do it. All borrowers should pay into the funds because all  borrowers benefit when the U.S. has a strong financial base. This might also  help deter some borrowing which should help increase our rate of savings.  </P> <P> WM. S. MORTIMER  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

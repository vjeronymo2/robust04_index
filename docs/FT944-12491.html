			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: Avenor moves steadily back to profitability Avenor, the Canadian forest products group, is moving steadily back towards profitability with higher prices and surging demand for pulp, newsprint and white papers and a lower Canadian dollar, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Third-quarter operating profit was CDollars 33.5m (USDollars 24.8m), against an operating loss of CDollars 42.3m a year earlier, a turnround of CDollars 76m. However, after interest and special items, there was a loss of CDollars 16.6m, or 25 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 12.3m, or 20 cents, on sales of CDollars 488m, up 40 per cent. The nine-month final loss was CDollars 61.3m, or 93 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 125m, or CDollars 2.16, on sales of CDollars 1.38bn, up 21 per cent. Avenor said newsprint price increases went through in the third quarter and its machines were running flat out. Manufacturing cost is down nearly 9 per cent. US consumption will rise further in the fourth quarter and another price increase has been announced for December 1.</p>

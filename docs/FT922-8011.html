			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Arjo Wiggins There are two possible reactions to the resignation of Arjo Wiggins Appleton's chief executive five days before the annual meeting. First, the company is better off for having resolved its internal tensions, however brusquely. Second, the event is alarming evidence of strategic disarray at the heart of one of Europe's biggest paper-makers. The latter judgment is probably not so much wrong as premature. At the heart of the row is not merely a disagreement over whether to grow aggressively by acquisition. There is also a classic confrontation between the traditional autonomy of an Anglo-Saxon chief executive and the traditional controlling rights of a 40 per cent French shareholder. St Louis must now demonstrate that its preferred and safer route of organic investment need not mean unexciting earnings growth. In view of the prospective upturn in the paper cycle, that may not prove too difficult. But the London stock market will also want St Louis to make clear, if only through its choice of a new chief executive, whether it wants Arjo Wiggins to continue as an Anglo-French merger or become a French company pure and simple.</p>

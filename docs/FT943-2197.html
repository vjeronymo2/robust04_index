			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Dinkie Heel falls 25% to Pounds 231,000 Although turnover rose 5 per cent, Dinkie Heel's pre-tax profits were down 25 per cent from Pounds 309,000 to Pounds 231,000 for the half year to June 30. The company, which supplies components for footwear manufacture and repair, saw turnover increase from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 3.65m. Mr David Parkes, chairman, said profits had been affected by loss of production, owing to the need to replace furnace equipment in June rather than during the July holiday period. Earnings per share were 1.35p (1.76p). The interim dividend is unchanged at 0.5p.</p>

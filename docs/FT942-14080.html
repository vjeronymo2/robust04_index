			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / International Bonds: Greece to tap DM FRN sector directly Greece is expected to tap the international capital markets directly for the first time next week with a DM1bn offering of floating-rate notes (FRNs). In the past, the Bank of Greece has acted as the issuer on behalf of the republic. The offering, which will be jointly lead-managed by CS First Boston and Deutsche Bank, will have a maturity of five or seven years. The notes are likely to be priced to yield between 100 and 110 basis points over Libor. Some syndicate managers were surprised that Greece had decided to launch its first deal under its new name of the Hellenic Republic in the D-Mark FRN sector which has a lower profile than the much larger Eurodollar FRN market. The last sovereign borrower to tap the D-Mark FRN sector was the Kingdom of Spain with a DM2bn issue in June 1992, though there have been several deals for domestic issuers. It is believed that Greece plumped for D-Marks because it was shown better execution than in floating-rate dollars, for which it would have had to pay 120 basis points over Libor. KfW, the German government agency for redevelopment, is thought to be watching the market with a view to raising DM1.5bn through an offering of 10-year Eurobonds. JP Morgan and WestLB are arranging the issue. Another deal which could be launched in the near future is a FFr5bn fixed-rate offering for Belgium. The favoured maturity is said to be eight years and price talk is 20 to 25 basis points over the French government bond yield curve. Several banks are thought to be bidding for the mandate. Among yesterday's events, L-Bank's DM2bn offering of five-year global bonds was priced to yield 36 basis points over the five-year Treuhand bonds due October 1999. When freed to trade, the yield spread widened out to as far as 42 basis points, reflecting volatile market conditions and the emergence of some loose bonds. However, joint lead manager JP Morgan said that the bonds closed at 99.05, down from a re-offer price of 99.20, to give a yield spread of 39 basis points. Abbey National and Halifax Building Society issued structured bonds to raise funds in Italian lire and sterling respectively. Abbey raised L150bn with 10-year Eurobonds callable after two years and annually thereafter at par. The proceeds were swapped into floating-rate lire and will be used to fund Abbey's growing Italian mortgage book. Lead manager Credito Italiano said the coupon of 9 5/8 per cent on the bonds appealed in particular to domestic retail investors.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (Section 3) (as amended by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992) requires that employment and other economic opportunities generated by Federal financial assistance for housing and community development programs shall, to the greatest extent feasible, be directed toward low- and very low-income persons, particularly, those who are recipients of government assistance for housing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirements of Section 3 apply to HAs for modernization activities, notwithstanding the amount of the assistance provided to the HA or the amount of the contract or subcontract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For CGP, the Section 3 rule requires HAs to certify compliance with Section 3 and demonstrate this compliance by committing ``to the greatest extent feasible'' to meet the numerical goals set in the Section 3 interim rule (24 CFR 135.30). For CGP, HUD requested through the letter transmitting the FY 1994 presumptive estimate, that each HA to the greatest extent feasible, establish and commit to numerical goals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each HA is required to submit, with the annual P&amp;E Report, an annual Section 3 report on Form HUD&hyph;60002. The HA must document actions taken to comply with the requirements of Section 3, the results of actions taken and impediments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As part of the process of development of the Section 3 interim rule and data collection, the Department held meetings with various housing authorities, industry groups and organizations which are currently subject to compliance with Section 3 or share interest in the regulatory implementation of Section 3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Burden  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter recommended that CGP funds be allocated through the HA's operating budget in order to eliminate most CGP paperwork.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  HUD does not have the statutory authority to allocate CGP funds through the Performance Funding System.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Consistent Funding Levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Three commenters concluded that a constant or increasing level of funding for CGP is required if HAs are to complete required improvements on public housing properties to ensure their long-term viability. Decreases in funding levels results in only emergency work being completed and destroys HA's ability to do long range planning and follow thorough on commitments made to the residents. Significant decreases from year to year (anything exceeding 10%) was stated to result in delays in implementing completed design work (risking the need to revise work based on changing existing conditions) and decreased resident participation and interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  HUD understands the competing demands for limited resources and the significant points made by the commenters. HUD is bound by the modernization appropriations and formula.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> ACC and CGP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  CLPHA stated that all statements about flexibility in the CGP rule should over-ride less flexible statements in the ACC, and that the ACC should be revised to be consistent with the CGP rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  HUD has started revising the ACC with the goal of simplifying the contract and placing most of the existing requirements in program regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Contractor Delays, Wage Rates and CSP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One HA indicated that greater consideration should be given to valid delays, including contractor or consultant performance problems which impact obligation and expenditure of CGP funds, including those which may remain after planned work items have been completed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  HUD does consider contractor delays to be an acceptable reason outside of the HA's control for the HA to execute a time extension in its implementation schedule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Wage rate determinations have become increasingly problematic in their timing and completeness. They are received after contracts are executed and sometimes many months of construction has already been completed. Often there is no wage rate determination given for requested classifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department is unaware of any widespread or systemic problems involving the provision of Davis-Bacon wage determinations for modernization projects. HUD is installing a Davis-Bacon wage determination database to expedite the provision of determinations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Expedite wage-rate issuances. HUD should expedite Davis-Bacon issuances and eliminate variances between HUD and DOL requirements. The date of the wage decision should be the date of the start of the contract. HAs shouldn't have to delay opening of the bids because of a ``pending wage decision.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  HUD works closely with DOL to assure that wage determinations are made available for projects in a timely manner. This means that the wage determinations must be made available for incorporation into bid solicitations. There are projects which are subject to HUD-determined wage rates (``non-routine'' maintenance) rather than DOL-determined wage rates which are issued under the Davis-Bacon and Related Acts. Resultant variations in wages which may be issued are due to the fact that the work is defined differently and the rates are determined under separate legal authorities. The applicable Davis-Bacon wage determination for a particular project is ``locked in'' at the award of the contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  An HA suggests that HUD encourage local expenditures. Although Consolidated Supply type programs provide competitive rates, they do nothing for the local economy. The HA suggested that HUD emphasize the ``buy locally'' proposition in order to best stimulate the HA's local economy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  HAs are required to follow the Department's regulation at 24 CFR 85.36 for the procurement of goods and services. This regulation was developed pursuant to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A&hyph;102, Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants to State and Local Governments, to provide consistent government-wide procurement standards in Federal grant programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of the fundamental principles of the regulation is that all procurements are to be conducted in a manner to promote full and open competition. The principle is intended to ensure equal treatment among contractors, while providing the most advantageous prices in the market place, particularly when the Federal government is providing the funds. Consistent with the concept of providing equal treatment among contractors is a specific requirement in the regulation prohibiting the use of statutorily or administratively imposed in-state or local geographical preferences in the award of contracts. Further, restricting competition to local contractors will not yield HAs the best prices in the market place. This is particularly important with limited Federal resources. Accordingly, the Department does not accept the comment that HUD should emphasize the ``buy locally'' proposition in order to stimulate the HA's local economy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- International Trade and  Industry Minister Eijiro Hata on Tuesday [31 May] reiterated  Japan's opposition to setting "numerical targets" to gauge  foreign access to its markets.    "Japan could not swallow any U.S. proposals that would lead  to acceptance of numerical trade targets," Hata told a press  conference.    Hata was speaking ahead of the resumption Wednesday of  sectoral talks on a new bilateral trade framework.    Japan and the United States have agreed to restart the  deadlocked trade talks on condition that Washington will not  bring up the issue of numerical targets, Hata said.    But "a source of contention" still exists between the two  countries, he added.    Recently, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said the  U.S. will pursue "result-oriented" accords in trade talks with  Japan, including seeking a guarantee from the Japanese  Government to expand the number of Japanese auto dealers  handling U.S.-made models.    Whether or not dealers will sell U.S. automobiles is a  matter  for the private sector, Hata said. He urged U.S. automakers to  work harder to make their products attractive to Japanese  consumers.</p>

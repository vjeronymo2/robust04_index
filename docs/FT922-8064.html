			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Genoa (4) - An international meeting place / Conferences, The new Congress Centre in the old cotton warehouses gives the city a high-tech, purpose-built venue WHEN Confindustria, Italy's employers' federation, held its most recent congress earlier this year, it opted for Genoa. But rather than meeting in some well-established centre, the 2,000-odd delegates found themselves occupying the stalls of the Carlo Felice opera house. The choice of Genoa, and the theatre, probably reflected a desire to promote the city in Columbus year. And many of the delegates would undoubtedly have been keen to see the lavishly-restored theatre, which has received heaps of publicity. But it also demonstrated Genoa's lack of a suitable venue. Only with the opening of the new Congress Centre in the converted old cotton warehouses, which form part of the Expo site, will Genoa be able to boast a high-tech, purpose-built venue of its own. Converting the cotton warehouses, built by the British at the beginning of this century, has been a race against time, with workers in the building virtually up to a minute before its formal opening with the annual shareholders' meeting of the Banca Popolare di Genova. However, visitors are likely to be impressed. With its twin halls on either side of a central stage, the centre offers flexible seating for up to 1,500, along with a series of smaller auditoria seating up to 400. There is also a huge amount of exhibition space on the four floors. Typical of the iron and brick port architecture of the era, the long, thin cotton warehouse stretches for almost a quarter of a mile along the Molo Vecchio wharf jutting out into the harbour. While the exterior has been largely preserved, much of the interior has been transformed. The final section housing the conference centre has been gutted. From its upper floors, delegates will be able to look over the port, while a smaller building alongside houses all the services, such as sophisticated air conditioning, needed for a new conference centre. The complex even has its own telecommunications centre for live teleconferencing. The congress centre has already lined up five big international conventions to run concurrently with the Christopher Columbus exhibition, as well as a range of seminars and lectures. All will focus on maritime issues, including environmental protection and preservation, as well as legal matters. The creation of the congress centre means Genoa now has two venues for conventions, not counting the opera house, which is likely to revert to full-time cultural use. Over at the fair, the convention centre offers facilities for up to 800 in its largest auditorium, while a smaller hall can accommodate around 400 delegates. Further facilities are available at a number of hotels in the city, notably the Star, hard by Brignole station in the Corte Lambruschini complex. However, conference-goers should have an even wider range of choice come October, when a new hotel is expected to open near the airport, with a range of meeting halls of its own.</p>

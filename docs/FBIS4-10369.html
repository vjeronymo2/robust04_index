			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the last report issued by the Apoyo  survey company in March, President Alberto Fujimori obtained 61  percent support for his government, which shows a three-point  recovery of the eight points lost in February as a result of the  promulgation of the polemic Cantuta law. Moreover, the way in  which the government is handling the economic policy obtained  the approval of 42 percent of the polled people, which is the  same as last month.    Apoyo also asked people what they thought about the current  government: 51 percent said they thought it was democratic and  31 percent a dictatorship.    In February, however, 61 percent believed Fujimori's  government was democratic. This 10 percent drop is probably an  indication that the effects of the Cantuta law still prevail.    This probably also explains why the number of people who  would vote for Fujimori remains at 40 percent (although the  number of people who approve of his performance has increased),  while those who would vote for Javier Perez de Cuellar has  increased from 41 to 44 percent.    This also shows in the fact that 43 percent have said they  will vote for Fujimori, 28 percent for an independent candidate,  and 12 percent for an opposition candidate. Which means that the  people favor an independent rather than an opposition candidate,  which, in turn, is in line with the increasing support for Perez  de Cuellar, who is not viewed as an opposition candidate but  rather as a continuation of Fujimorism without Fujimori, as a  "democratic" Fujimorism or free of Fujimori's "dictatorial"  aspects.    However, approval for the political opposition has increased  by one point (34 percent) and disapproval dropped by two points,  that is, from 45 to 47 percent, which reveals a slight  improvement.    Moreover, Clae [Latin American Center of Business  Counseling]  President Carlos Manrique's popularity has dropped since last  November. The percentage of people who consider him a dishonest  person has increased from 54 to 61 percent. There are, however,  27 percent who consider him honest.    But only 10 percent believe in what Manrique says. Which  means that 17 percent believe he is honest but do not believe  what he says. Can one be honest and a liar at the same time?  This is a paradox of polls.</p>

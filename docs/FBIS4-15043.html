			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 5 Apr -- "A decision has to be made on  Russia's participation in the NATO `Partnership for Peace'  program, not only at the level of executive power; agreement is  also necessary with the legislative power." This was stated  today in an exclusive interview with the ITAR-TASS correspondent  by State Duma deputy, Minister for Affairs of Nationalities and  Regional Policy Sergey Shakhray.    According to him, "this is such a conceptual step in the  development of the country that it is necessary to debate it at  all levels, including the parliament." The Russian leadership  must "exercise the maximum of coordination in its approach to  decisionmaking, because the State Duma will have to ratify this  agreement later."    Sergey Shakhray would view Russia's participation in the  Partnership for Peace program as an "obvious advantage" and he  even compared it to "overcoming the iron curtain."    As a disadvantage, he mentioned the fact that "after the  disintegration of the Warsaw Pact Russia should have thought  about setting up a new security system." "One must remember that  Russia is a Eurasian state, and it is still unclear how its  participation in the NATO initiative will reflect on its  relations with other CIS countries and its Eastern neighbors,  for example China", he said. "We are also worried that our  country might lose markets for weapons."    Sergey Shakhray agreed that if Russia were to join the  Partnership for Peace program, it could have a special status.  The minister believes that "it is necessary to debate this  matter at the Security Council, then at the Federation Council,  and to make a final decision once all positions have been  coordinated."    Speaking about a possible timetable for Russia's joining the  Partnership for Peace program, Sergey Shakhray said that "this  process will probably take one or two months."</p>

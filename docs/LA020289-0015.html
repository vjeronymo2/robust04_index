			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CANYON'S MCCUNE REJECTS OFFER, RULES OUT FOOTBALL AS FRESHMAN  </P> <P> Sean McCune, a Times All-Valley linebacker from Canyon High, became the second  Cowboy in 2 days to say he does not intend to play college football next fall.  </P> <P> McCune said Wednesday that Colorado State recruiter Skip Holtz, son of Notre  Dame Coach Lou Holtz, offered him a scholarship after a recruiting trip 2 weeks  ago. But McCune rejected the offer, canceled recruiting trips to San Diego  State and Washington State and said that he does not want to play football.  </P> <P> Justin Fix, McCune's teammate on the Canyon defense, said Tuesday that he does  not plan to play football or attend college next fall, citing academic problems  and his own mixed feelings about the sport.  </P> <P> McCune, a 6-foot-2, 220-pound senior, carries a 3.4 grade-point average and  plans to attend school. He said that he has applied at Arizona and Arizona  State and might play later in his college career.  </P> <P> "I think the best thing for me right now is to not play football," he said. "I  just don't want to play anymore. I just want to go to school and worry about  college."  </P> <P> McCune insisted that the decision is his own and should not reflect on Coach  Harry Welch's program at Canyon. McCune transferred from Agoura to play his  senior season at Canyon.  </P> <P> "They have an excellent program at Canyon and I really improved as a player,"  he said. "It's not that Cowboy football turned me off. If anything, that's what  turned me on to football." JOHN LYNCH  </P></p>

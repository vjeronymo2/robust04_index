			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by XINHUA reporters Pu Liye (5543 4539 2814) and Xu </F> Xingtang (1776 5281 1016): "Change Concepts To Seek Development  -- An Interview With Qinghai Governor and National People's  Congress Deputy Tian Chengping"]    [Text] Beijing, 16 Mar (XINHUA) -- Although their province  is still being labeled as a "resource-rich, poverty-stricken  province," the people of Qinghai are as determined and  courageous as their counterparts in the hinterland in seizing  opportunities to develop their economy. During an interview by  reporters, Qinghai Governor Tian Chengping, who is a deputy to  the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress  [NPC], said confidently: "Everybody is talking about  opportunities. Qinghai Province is similarly faced with very  rare development opportunities."    Such opportunities primarily signify that this year's  surging  tide of reform will breathe new life into Qinghai's economy.  Meanwhile, the current NPC session has given the people of  Qinghai a profound sense that economic development in west China  is commanding growing attention.    A review of their past achievements gives the people of  Qinghai both gratification and anxiety. In 1993, Qinghai  Province topped the 10-billion-yuan mark in two areas, achieving  10.1 billion yuan in total output value of goods and services  and 10.2 billion yuan in total industrial and agricultural  output value. There were more than 60 "partly or wholly  foreign-owned" enterprises. For the people of Qinghai, these  figures were not achieved easily. The numbers pale in  comparison with those of economically developed provinces. The  people of Qinghai cannot but face this harsh reality: they are  lagging further and further behind the eastern regions in  economic development.    In light of this disparity, the people of Qinghai are  beginning to reevaluate their advantages and disadvantages.  Tian Chengping first touted Qinghai's enviable "resources" in  front of the reporters. Qinghai has energy resources. Located  in the upper reaches of the Huang He, it abounds in  hydroelectric resources, which are mainly concentrated in the  Longyang Gorge. Its salt lakes contain vast, high-grade  resources. Western Qinghai has ample petroleum and natural gas  resources, and its proven natural gas resources are the  country's fifth largest. Qinghai is also endowed with abundant  nonferrous metals, and flocks of cattle and sheep can be seen  everywhere.    Why, then, have the people of Qinghai suffered privation  while guarding their "gold mountain"? There are many reasons.  Qinghai is an outlying province which lacks advanced  communications facilities, funds, and skilled manpower. Tian  Chengping did not dwell on these problems, though. He  maintained: Although Qinghai must improve these conditions for  the sake of economic development, its most important task is to  change its concepts and move quickly to foster new notions,  ideas, and thinking suited to the market economy.    Tian Chengping said: The people of Qinghai must at least  change their "mentalities" in the following four areas:    1) They should abandon the concept born of a self-contained,  conservative, and self-sufficient small-scale peasant economy,  moving quickly to foster commodity and market concepts. Take  animal husbandry as an example. They should no longer feel  honored by the "large number of livestock in their possession"  but should improve the slaughter rate in every possible way. 2)  They should modify the concept born of excessive reliance under  the planned economy of the past, in favor of a concept that  favors competition in the market and independent development.  In recent years, Qinghai provided highway construction jobs in  lieu of relief, creating a good opportunity for increasing  income. The jobs were taken up by laborers from the eastern  regions because some local people were unwilling to take them.  Instead of helping themselves, these people would rather wait  for state relief. 3) They should discard the notion that  encourages seclusion, moving to foster a concept that favors  opening up in all directions. They should no longer think that  they will suffer at the hands of outsiders and lose their  benefits to the latter. In any event, we have witnessed  appreciable changes in this respect. In recent years, Qinghai  established partnership relationships with 14 counties and  cities in Shandong by which the two sides exchanged cadres and  harnessed their respective strengths for mutual benefit and  common development. The practice was very successful. 4)  Cadres and people should foster a new concept that encourages  bold action to overtake others, discarding the previous notion  that a peaceful life will suffice. They should no longer aim  for only a moderate level of prosperity, should stop muddling  along, and should no longer revert to lounging in the sunshine  despite what they think and say. They should truly rouse  themselves to action and swim courageously in the ocean of the  market economy.    At this point, Tian Chengping sounded very excited. This man  from northern China had performed brilliantly in Beijing's  Xicheng District before being transferred to Qinghai to serve as  its governor. He is now working heroically and enthusiastically  on the loess soil of Qinghai. He told reporters: On the one  hand, we should urge the state to give the western regions  preferential treatment in terms of policy and funds; on the  other hand, we should liberate our minds, change our concepts,  rely on ourselves, and carry out arduous pioneering work. Only  by doing so can we push Qinghai's economy onto the path toward  prosperity and strength at an early date.    At the end of the interview, Tian Chengping said: "Qinghai  will not and should not remain poor forever."</p>

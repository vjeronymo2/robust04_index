			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses stage turnround after early gloom Yesterday morning was gloomy, as Mr Albert Edwards, the Kleinwort Benson strategist, reduced his weighting for Europe excluding the UK by a swingeing seven percentage points, from 15 to 8 per cent. However, bourses staged a turnround in the afternoon following the fall in US December unemployment figures, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT moved from a fall of 8.58 to 2,211.64 on the session, down 2.4 per cent on the week, to 2,224.95 at the end of the post-bourse. Mr Nigel Longley of Commerzbank said that there was a lot of short covering after the US unemployment figures. Turnover rose from DM8.2bn to DM10.8bn. Metallgesellschaft was requoted, falling DM52.50 to DM218 on the session and recovered a token DM4 of that in the afternoon. Deutsche Bank, with apparently the greatest banking exposure to the debacle, recovered DM4 to DM863 on the session, and another DM7.50 to DM870.50 after hours. Commerzbank announced a deep discount rights issue and a rise in dividend which put it on a high, 4 1/2 per cent yield to German shareholders. It rose DM2.80 on the session to DM382.50, and soared to DM391 later. Mr Peter Thorne, banking analyst with Paribas Capital Markets in London, was cautious: 'Commerzbank was under-provided for LDC risks a couple of years ago,' he said, 'and there must be a suspicion in the market that it is lagging behind in provisions for bad and doubtful debts in the corporate sector.' PARIS posted a strong afternoon rebound which left the CAC 40 index 32.4 higher at 2,307.55, up 1.7 per cent on the week in heavy turnover of FFr7.4bn. Automotive stocks, higher in mid-week on hopes of government support for the industry, led the gains with Peugeot up FFr42, or 5.4 per cent at FFr817 and Michelin FFr11.80, or 5.5 better at FFr226.10. Metaleurop fell FFr6 to FFr77.40 after FFr73.30, and being suspended limit-down at one point; Eurotunnel eased FFr2.25 to FFr56.25 on profit  taking after weeks of steady gains. ZURICH closed at its fifth consecutive record high with firmer US bond and equity markets providing late support. The SMI index added 21.0 to 3,042.9 for a rise this week of 2.9 per cent. Nestle, SFr28 higher at SFr1,343, topped the active list, and other leaders included UBS, up SFr17 at SFr1,399, and Roche certificates, SFr105 higher at SFr6,490. Further demand for cyclicals took Georg Fischer bearers SFr75 higher to SFr1,300 and BBC Brown Boveri firmed SFr21 to SFr1,150. However, Sulzer which rose strongly earlier this week, shed SFr10 to SFr900 on profit-taking. Shares in Holderbank fell SFr20 to SFr965 after the cement producer said it planned to raise its stake in Holnam, the US subsidiary, to 100 per cent from 95 per cent. AMSTERDAM ended an active week in subdued mood but still managed to climb off earlier lows to book a cumulative 2.5 per cent gain on the renamed AEX over its first five sessions. The index added 0.45 to to close at 424.02, having posted an early intraday high of 425.41. KLM began firm before a sudden burst of British buying took the shares up 4 per cent in about 30 minutes amid speculation that a widely expected share issue may be imminent. After a day's high of Fl 45.00 they edged back to finish Fl 1.50 ahead at Fl 44.60. MILAN succumbed to immediate political worries and next Wednesday's parliamentary vote of confidence and the Comit index shed 14.6 or 2.4 per cent to 596.90. The index has fallen by 3.6 per cent over the week. Montedison dominated trading, as it has all week, dipping L9 to L885.90. Heavy arbitrage with its rights issue accounted for volume of 40m shares. Ferruzzi shed L252 or 15.5 per cent to L1,427 also amid arbitrage with its rights. Monday is the last day for both cash calls. BRUSSELS hit yet another high, the Bel-20 index ending 8.81 better at 1,498.22 for a gain of 1.7 per cent on the week, helped by an interest rate cut late on Thursday by the Banque Nationale de Belgique. STOCKHOLM found firm demand which took the Affarsvarlden general index 36.2 or 2.5 per cent higher at a record 1,475.0. Hennes &amp; Mauritz, the retailer, closed SKr26 or nearly 10 per cent higher at SKr298 amid expectations that a controversial advertising campaign could have the same impact on sales as one two years ago that featured the model, Cindy Crawford. B shares in Gambro, the medical equipment company rose SKr14 to SKr395 on expectations of strong growth in the price. ATHENS ended 5.7 per cent higher on the day and 12.4 per cent better on the week, the general index closing 58.44 higher at 1,077.83 on technical and sentiment grounds.

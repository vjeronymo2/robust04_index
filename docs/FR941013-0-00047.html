			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This will reduce administrative burdens on small operators by assuring that they will not need to undertake the steps associated with establishing restructured rates and service offerings that comply with our rules, including completion of FCC forms, until they are actually regulated. Moreover, this additional time to comply will not harm cable subscribers because, under transition relief, small operators are not required in any event to make competitive rate reductions pending the Commission's cost studies, but may set rates based on March 31, 1994 levels with some adjustments. Accordingly, we conclude that establishing a period of time after regulation begins for small operators to comply will further statutory purposes without injuring consumers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe that 90 days after the initial date of regulation is an appropriate period of time for small operator to establish rates and service offerings that comply with our rules. Accordingly, we will revise our rules to provide that small operators are not required to establish rates and service offerings that comply with our rules for 90 days after the initial date of regulation. In addition, in order to assure that this will reduce administrative burdens, we are changing our rules to provide that small operators do not need to file necessary rate justification forms with the local franchising authority, or the Commission, until 60 days after the initial date of regulation. However, we are not altering our rules concerning provision of advance notice to subscribers. Pursuant to those rules, all operators, including small operators, must give 30-days notice to subscribers prior to implementing rate and service changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, small systems and small operators may make their initial basic tier rates, established in accordance with the Commission's revised rate regulations, effective on 30-days notice without prior approval from their local franchising authority. If, upon subsequent examination of a rate justification, a local franchising authority or the Commission finds that a small operator or small system has implemented rates in excess of the maximum permitted rate, refunds may be ordered in accordance with our regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / TGWU calls for top-rate tax rises THE TGWU general union has called for a return to a top rate of tax of 60 per cent for high earners rather than a reduction of welfare benefits to help fund the Pounds 50bn deficit. Mr Bill Morris, the TGWU general secretary, said on the eve of the union's biennial conference that raising the top rate of tax would bring in at least Pounds 4.5bn a year.</p>

			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SIMI VALLEY CLINCHES SHARE OF TITLE  </P> <P> Greg Hess came bounding out of the visitors' locker room at Simi Valley High  with score book held high and that I've-found-the-cure-for-cancer look.  </P> <P> "Well, I just found out the real story," the Westlake coach said with  conviction. Listeners leaned forward in anticipation. "Five-for-16 from the  line."  </P> <P> Hess was explaining his Warriors' 61-59 Marmonte League loss to Simi Valley on  Friday night. Indeed, it was rather chilly around Westlake's free-throw line  (Simi Valley, on the other hand, made 19 of 26), but the real story was  standing several yards away, entangled in one vicious high-five session.  </P> <P> Simi Valley's Steve Carnes and Mike Wawryk, the high-fivers, scored 19 and 17  points, respectively, to help the Pioneers to a share of the league title. They  now have won or shared four consecutive championships.  </P> <P> Simi Valley and Camarillo, which lost to Thousand Oaks on Friday, will play  Wednesday at Camarillo where the Pioneers can win the title outright.  </P> <P> For Carnes and Wawryk, the win over Westlake was significant. Carnes, the lone  returnee from last season's Southern Section 4-A Division champion, admittedly  has been erratic. His play Friday was confident, controlled and effective.  </P> <P> "Some nights I come in and the shots fall in, and other nights they won't fall  for nothing," Carnes said. "Those things happen. I came in here knowing I had  been playing inconsistently, and I just wanted to come out and play as good as  I possibly could."  </P> <P> The 6-1 junior scored 7 points in the fourth quarter, including 3 free throws  in the final 3 minutes and 2 long-range jump shots that helped overcome a 47-45  Westlake advantage after 3 quarters.  </P> <P> "I think the kids really respect Steve's athletic ability," Simi Valley Coach  Dean Bradshaw said. "He's capable of bringing the guys to a level they're not  used to playing at."  </P> <P> Wawryk gives Simi Valley (16-7, 9-2) a consistent inside threat. The 6-5  center, who had to leave the team over the summer because his family was  moving, returned to Simi Valley just before the season began and 3 games ago  won the starting job.  </P> <P> "It's a good time for me to come out and show what I can do," said Wawryk, who  grabbed a team-high 8 rebounds and scored Simi Valley's first 8 points of the  fourth quarter, which the Pioneers opened with a 14-2 run.  </P> <P> Wawryk also helped contain Westlake center Kurt Schwan, who came into the game  needing 3 rebounds for the single-season Westlake record (he got 9) and 11  points for the school's career record (he got 6).  </P> <P> Peter Mladina led the Warriors (13-9, 6-4) with 16 points.  </P></p>

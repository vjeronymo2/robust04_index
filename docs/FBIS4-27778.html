			<p>BFN     [Text] The government has firmed up its plan of action in  the event sanctions are imposed against North Korea [DPRK] over  the issue of its suspected nuclear arms development program.    The plan is comprised of three major components: "control of  personnel exchanges," which bans visits and entries by Japanese  and DPRK Government officials into each other's countries, and  "control on academic and cultural exchanges"; "a ban on trade  and capital transactions"; and "control on commodities and  money." These plans will be readjusted during tripartite talks  with the United States and South Korea, which begin in  Washington on 4 June.    The government will first watch to see if sanctions are  imposed at all, and, if they are, whether they are a result of a  UN Security Council resolution or a unilateral judgment by the  three nations of Japan, the United States, and the ROK.  Depending on which course of action is taken, the government  will decide on specific actions to be taken.    According to the government plan, actions under the "control  on personnel exchanges" include: 1) restrictions of contacts  between diplomats [from Japan and the DPRK] in third countries;  2) a ban, in principle, on visits to the DPRK by Japanese  Government officials; 3) a ban on entry into the country by DPRK  Government officials, and a tightened review of [DPRK]  civilians' entry applications; and 4) a ban on special airplane  flights between Japan and the DPRK. Measures under the "control  on academic and cultural exchanges" include: 1) a ban on  importing, exporting, and brokered trade; 2) suspension of  investment, loans, and other types of capital transactions; and  3) restrictions on means of remittances into or out of [the  DPRK]. This means the "suspension of remittances" requested by  the United States is included in the actions.    However, from the humanitarian viewpoint, Korean residents  reentering Japan after visiting the DPRK are not included in the  ban.</p>

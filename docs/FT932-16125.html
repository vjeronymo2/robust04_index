			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Stagecoach gets Pounds 134m market value STAGECOACH, the Scottish-based company which operates bus services in the UK and Kenya, Malawi and New Zealand, is coming to the market via a placing and offer valuing the company at Pounds 134m. Some 11.7m shares priced at 112p will be offered to the public and a further 21.8m will be placed with institutions. The company aims to raise some Pounds 20.6m to fund acquisitions. The offer and placing have been fully underwritten by Noble Grossart. Stagecoach, founded by a brother and sister team in 1980 to take advantage of the privatisation of Britain's bus services, forecast pre-tax profits at least 56 per cent ahead to Pounds 12.8m for the year ended April 30. Earnings per shares are forecast to be not less than 7.8p for 1993. The company said the offer price represented a prospective p/e of 14.4. The notional dividend of 3.8p for 1993 offered a yield of 4.2 per cent. The allocation of the offer will be announced on April 20, and dealings are expected to commence on April 27. Mr Brian Souter, chairman, and his sister Mrs Ann Gloag, managing director, will own 56 per cent of Stagecoach after flotation. COMMENT The pricing of this issue has been finely tuned, leaving little chance of the stock opening to what some have called a 'monster premium'. The UK businesses, considered to be the gold in the Stagecoach carriage, appear to be on a market rating. Looking further out, investors might find difficulty with marketability, since the industry is relatively unknown to the City. There are also questions about the quality of the overseas businesses and the UK regulatory environment, with the government already muttering about some industry practices. On the other hand, Mr Souter and Mrs Gloag have proven themselves to be class managers and, more importantly, have a successful track record. There is much to go for, with some 30 per cent of the UK bus market left to be privatised. The issue is almost certain to receive enthusiastic support.</p>

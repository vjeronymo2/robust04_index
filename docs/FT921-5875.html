			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Arts: Today's Television BBC1's new comedy, Mulberry, (8.00) seems to have distinct possibilities. Esmonde and Larbey, a practised writing team, are good at judging the right point between 'quirky' and 'ludicrously contrived' and they may have done it again. Karl Howman plays the working class rough diamond, Mulberry, who is hired by the upper class old maid, Miss Farnaby (Geraldine McEwan). Horizon considers how money should be spent on science: on research projects with known practical applications or on establishing the origins of the universe? (8.10 BBC2). World In Action (8.30 ITV) investigates the 'dirty tricks' departments of the three main political parties. The C4 documentary series Cutting Edge returns for another series with a programme about missing people, in particular Billy Dunne who, on June 22 1987, went out to buy a birthday present for his son and has not been seen by his family since. In Panorama Jane Corbin reports on the mining industry seven years after the strike. Arthur Scargill's warnings about closures and redundancies look pretty weak and feeble alongside the reality (9.30 BBC1).</p>

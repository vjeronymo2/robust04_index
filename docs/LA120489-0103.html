			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CZECHS RALLY AGAINST NEW GOVERNMENT;  </P> <P> EAST BLOC: CROWDS DEMAND COMMUNIST HARD-LINERS RESIGN. OPPOSITION LEADERS  CHARGE THEY WERE CHEATED OF A POWER-SHARING CABINET.  </P> <P> More than 250,000 pro-democracy demonstrators thronged Prague's Wenceslas  Square today chanting "They must go!" in an angry protest against Communist  domination of Czechoslovakia's new government.  </P> <P> The jostling crowd howled for the resignation of Communist hard-liners as  leaders of the Civic Forum opposition movement accused Prime Minister Ladislav  Adamec of cheating their expectations of a power-sharing Cabinet.  </P> <P> A workers' spokesman, Igor Pleskot, said workers should be prepared for a  general strike next Monday unless Adamec took people supported by Civic Forum  into the government by the end of the week.  </P> <P> "We want honorable, expert and undiscredited men," Civic Forum's Jiri Cerny  told the demonstrators.  </P> <P> Adamec appointed non-Communist ministers Sunday for the first time since the  1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia to suppress the "Prague Spring"  reforms.  </P> <P> But the inclusion of 16 Communists in the 21-member team only deepened the  political crisis that began Nov. 17.  </P> <P> Student Michal Sedlacek accused the Communist Party of ignoring Parliament's  abolition last week of its monopoly of power after 40 years of unbroken rule.  </P> <P> The new government "does not correspond to the real division of the political  forces in our society," he said. "We feel disappointed and cheated and that is  why we will go on striking."  </P> <P> Also today, thousands of tourists from Czechoslovakia freely visited the West  for the first time in decades after the government lifted most travel  restrictions. It was one of the major concessions made last week to the  opposition.  </P> <P> There were no long lines reported at any border crossings to the West.  Czechoslovaks still need a visa from most Western countries they wish to visit,  with only Austria lifting visa requirements.  </P> <P> Unlike the mass exodus of East Germans earlier this year, most of the travelers  from Czechoslovakia were not resettling abroad.  </P> <P> In a related development, the Soviet Union and the four other Warsaw Pact  nations that invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968 to crush a reform movement today  condemned the action.  </P> <P> The statement came as East Bloc leaders met in Moscow to hear President Mikhail  S. Gorbachev's report on his meeting with President Bush.  </P> <P> The leaders of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Hungary, East Germany and Poland  said the entrance of their troops into Czechoslovakia 21 years ago constituted  "interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign Czechoslovakia and must be  condemned."  </P></p>

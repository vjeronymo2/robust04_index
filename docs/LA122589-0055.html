			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. FORCES INVADE PANAMA, OUST NORIEGA REGIME  </P> <P> Until recently, Gen. Manuel Noriega was an asset of the CIA, relied upon for  assisting U.S. counterinsurgency operations in Central America. He has  consistently been repressive and corrupt. Yet, only when he became a liability  for U.S. policy in 1987 did the U.S. government turn against him.  </P> <P> Now President Bush -- who as CIA director was aware of our relationship with  Noriega -- authorizes the invasion of Panama to impose U.S. foreign (and  internal political) interests once again. In stark contrast to the dramatic  peaceful changes sweeping throughout Eastern Europe, Bush's use of military  force to overthrow Noriega sets a very bad profile for the United States.  </P> <P> U.S. military forces should be withdrawn from Panama immediately, in favor of  diplomatic actions by the United Nations or the Organization of American  States.  </P> <P> LINDA LOTZ  </P> <P> Field Secretary  </P> <P> American Friends Service Committee, Pasadena  </P></p>

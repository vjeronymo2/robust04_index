			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Battle for VSEL intensifies as BAe raises bid to Pounds 560m British Aerospace raised the stakes yesterday in the battle for VSEL by increasing its share offer for the nuclear submarine-maker to about Pounds 560m. This is some 5 per cent above GEC's rival cash bid. BAe also raised its cash alternative to match GEC's Pounds 14-a-share offer. Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, said the new offer was designed to put it on level terms with GEC before the Office of Fair Trading decides whether to refer the bids to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. 'We will now be able to get back to the real commercial and competition issues,' Mr Evans said. He denied that the timing of the offer reflected BAe's view of the likelihood of GEC's bid being referred, estimating the odds at 'about 50-50'. Mr Richard Lapthorne, BAe finance director, added: 'We were advised that it was very unlikely that we could buy VSEL for less than Pounds 14 a share even if the GEC bid was referred.' Most analysts believe GEC will return with a higher bid, possibly before the OFT's decision, which is due by December 7. 'GEC has to come back even if it means overpaying,' said Mr Sandy Morris, engineering analyst at NatWest Securities. 'BAe is making an aggressive move into GEC's patch.' GEC said that it would make 'an appropriate response' to the revised offer in due course while VSEL recommended that its shareholders take no action. The cash alternative for the new BAe offer will be funded by a novel two-stage rights issue at 390p, which will allow BAe to increase the offer again without having to renegotiate its underwriting. If it did raise its offer further, BAe said it would seek shareholder approval before sealing a successful bid. Even if BAe's bid fails, it will raise Pounds 178m from the first tranche of the issue. The second tranche, which is conditional on the offer succeeding, will raise up to a further Pounds 357m, exactly matching any extra funds BAe requires to meet the cash alternative. BAe said Pounds 178m was the lowest fixed amount it could raise under such a scheme and denied suggestions that the structure of the deal was designed to strengthen its balance sheet even if the bid failed. VSEL has a cash pile of almost Pounds 300m and some observers have described BAe's bid as a 'disguised rights issue' to broaden its narrow asset base. BAe said at the higher offer, VSEL would still enhance earnings by more than 10 per cent next year and it would not lead to any dilution 'for the foreseeable future'. VSEL's shares rose 90p to Pounds 14.88, about 16p above the value of BAe's 3.3 for 1 share offer. BAe's share price fell 19p to 446p. GEC's rose 2p to 287.5p. Background, Page 12 Lex, Page 22</p>

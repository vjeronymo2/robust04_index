			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FESTIVAL '90;  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> OPEN FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> MACHOVER'S MAGIC IN CYBERARTS FINALE  </P> <P> Tod Machover is one of the reigning masters of computer-aided music making, an  institutional blueblood from the MIT Media Laboratory via IRCAM in Paris and  Juilliard. Sunday afternoon he closed out the CyberArts International  conference at the Biltmore Hotel with a sonically voluptuous, technologically  dazzling program of his recent works.  </P> <P> The two ensemble pieces involved what Machover calls "hyperinstruments" --  amplified, computer-enhanced extensions of normal instruments, with effects  somewhat like Morton Subotnick's familiar "ghost" electronics.  </P> <P> "Bug-Mudra" is a fast ride in a fun machine, based on two guitars and a modest  percussion battery. Basically a very sophisticated, techno-pop moto perpetuo,  it storms along with irresistible energy and elan.  </P> <P> Machover himself conducted, looking something like Woody Allen as a crazed  musician, wearing a dataglove -- tied into the hyperinstrument system, of  course -- on his left hand, with its cable sneaking out under his coat like a  tail. David Starobin and Oren Fader were the virtuosic, tireless guitarists,  and Amy Knowles plied the percussion.  </P> <P> The most technically simple -- everything is relative -- and shortest piece,  the taped "Flora," proved the most musically beguiling, with its moody  transformations of soprano Karol Bennett's voice. Accompanying it was a  luminous, similarly evolving HDTV video by Yoichiro Kawaguchi.  </P> <P> "Towards the Center" utilized the always effective services of the California  E.A.R. Unit, conducted by Stephen Mosko, and abetted by the hyperinstrument  system. Strip away the glossy production, however, and underneath lay a rather  ordinary neo-romantic essay, conventional in thought and expression.JOHN HENKEN  </P></p>

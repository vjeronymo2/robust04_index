			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Rudkowski] </F>   [Excerpts] Today's session of the Supreme Soviet will see  the announcement of the results of a roll-call vote on a package  of bills related to the Constitution of the Republic of Belarus.  One of these issues is the introduction of the post of  president as the head of state and executive branch. The  official results will be made known at 1800. With regard to the  president -- who is eligible for this post and how they will be  elected -- by nationwide elections or by people's deputies in  this Oval Room? -- the Supreme Soviet should adopt an  appropriate law. This extremely important issue concerning  presidential elections is now in the hands of the people's  deputies. [passage omitted]    Before discussion of the agenda for today's session, the  Supreme Soviet was addressed by Chairman Mechyslaw Ivanavich  Hryb. Here is an excerpt from his address:    [Begin Hryb recording] For some time now, especially after  my election to the post of Supreme Soviet chairman, some media,  in particular the papers SVABODA [in Minsk] and IZVESTIYA,  started publishing reports that do not correspond to the facts.  These publications compromise me as a man and the chairman of  the Supreme Soviet. Esteemed People's Deputies! I want to  assure you: It is not a question of my inability to defend my  dignity and honor, to obtain justice in a legal way through the  courts, and to punish the guilty. By the way, it happened once  with regard to the SVABODA newspaper. The question is that I do  not have time to bring any action in the courts. Therefore, I  am forced to address you, People's Deputies, respected electors,  and citizens of the Republic, and assure you that my program and  my demands for establishing order and discipline in the  Republic, as well as to strengthen the fight against crime are  not liked by everyone. However, I assure all citizens of our  Republic that I will not retreat from this course. [end  recording] [passage omitted]</p>

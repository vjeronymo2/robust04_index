			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: CAVALIERS MATCH OFFER BY HEAT FOR WILLIAMS  </P> <P> The Cleveland Cavaliers have matched the Miami Heat's $26.5-million, seven-year  offer for forward John Williams, the Cavaliers announced Thursday night.  </P> <P> By matching the offer, the Cavaliers' payroll will soar through the NBA's  $11.87-million salary cap, limiting the ability to rework contracts of veterans  or to sign free agents.  </P> <P> The salary cap can be surpassed in this instance because Cleveland had no  control over the offer Miami made to Williams.  </P></p>

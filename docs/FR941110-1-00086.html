			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Treatment of Controlled Substances Remaining in Emptied Containers, i.e. ``Heels''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Heels are the amount of a substance remaining in a vessel or container after the majority is off-loaded or discharged. For example, when a ship returns from transporting a controlled substance, the container that held the controlled substance often retains a residue of the substance. This is known as the heel. Heels can be as much as ten percent of the volume of a given container. A ship returning with a heel represents a significant volume of controlled substance returning to the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Heels are included in the current definition of bulk controlled substance in the current regulation. Therefore, the current interpretation of a bulk controlled substance requires ships returning with a heel to the United States to expend consumption allowances to import that substance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA proposes amending the current consumption allowance requirements to exempt heels, effective January 1, 1995. The amended definition will allow vessels with heels to return to the United States if the company certifies that certain conditions are met. EPA proposes that heels be exempted from the consumption allowance requirements if the company bringing the heel into the United States certifies that the residual amount will remain in the container and be included in a future shipment, or recovered and banked for future recycling, reclamation, transformation, destruction or non-emissive use. The industry rule-of-thumb is that a heel is up to ten percent of the volume of the container. Therefore, EPA proposes that containers returning to the United States with more than ten percent of their volume filled with controlled substance, and labelled as a heel, be required to expend consumption allowances to import the substance until January 1, 1996. After January 1, 1996, a heel that is greater than ten percent of the volume of the container would require the use of destruction or transformation credits for the importation for the amount in excess of ten percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency is proposing that persons who bring heels back to the United States report annually their returns of heels. The Agency will review this information to determine if the returns of heels is cause for concern due to volume and frequency of occurrence. Comments are requested on this issue of exempting heels from the requirements to expend consumption allowances to import.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Clarification of the Definition of Transhipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the current regulation a person who transships a controlled substance from one foreign country through the United States to another foreign destination does not need allowances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the current regulation, transhipments of controlled substances are excluded from the limits and requirements for allowances. The current regulation excludes transhipments from the allowance requirements consistent with the Decision of the Parties to the Protocol. However, EPA wishes to further elaborate on the definition of transhipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The request to clarify the definition of transhipment was made by a company who ships controlled substances through United States ports. The company brings controlled substances from other countries to United States ports where the contents of a larger vessel are subdivided into smaller vessels for shipment to other countries. The question arose whether this constituted repackaging and therefore was considered an import and thus subject to the requirements of the regulation. Although the language of the regulation does not preclude repackaging, the preamble states that transhipments are shipments of bulk chemicals that are ``not repackaged within the United States.'' Therefore, the transfer of a controlled substance from one ship to another while in a U.S. port could possibly be interpreted to constitute repackaging.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In today's proposal, EPA further clarifies the definition of transhipment to allow for the transfer of controlled substances between ships in United States ports as long as the substance does not enter into United States jurisdiction. In other words, repackaging of controlled substances that are being transhipped through the United States, and that do not enter into United States jurisdiction, do not require the expenditure of allowances. Today's proposal is intended to clarify that transhipments do not require consumption allowances to be expended, whether or not the controlled substance is repackaged. Today's clarification does not change the current rule; and transhipments are still excluded from the requirements for production and consumption allowances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA wishes to further clarify the definition of transhipment to allow for shipments into and out of United States foreign trade zones and subzones without requiring the expenditure of production or consumption allowances. Controlled substances that enter United States foreign trade zones and subzones are not considered to be entering into United States jurisdiction. EPA seeks comments on the proposed clarification of the definition of transhipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

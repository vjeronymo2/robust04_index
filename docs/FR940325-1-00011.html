			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1275.16(e) clarifies the nomenclature used throughout the regulations and distinguishes between ``Archivist,'' defined as the Archivist of the United States or his or her designated agent, and ``archivist,'' as defined in the current subsection,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as an employee of the National Archives and Records Administration, who, by education or experience, is specially trained in archival techniques. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1275.16(g) clarifies the definition of ``archival processing'' to ensure that nothing in the subsection creates any obligation on the part of the Archivist to perform any one particular archival processing task listed in the subsection. In so doing, the National Archives and Records Administration intends to make clear that transcripts of the tape recordings need not be made. Although the current regulations indicate that the processing of the Nixon White House materials may undergo one or more of several archival processing phases, including the preparation of transcripts, the National Archives and Records Administration does not believe that the regulations intended to obligate the processing archivists to transcribe all 4,000 hours of tape recordings before releasing them to the public. Indeed, the National Archives and Records Administration has estimated that it would take an extraordinary amount of staff time to accomplish such a task. In addition, the definition of ``archival processing'' in &sect;1275.16(g) has been expanded to reflect the archival processing of the Nixon Presidential materials that actually has been taking place. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1275.20 is amended to be consistent with the amended definition of ``Archivist'' set forth in amended &sect;1275.16(e) above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1275.42(a) is amended to clarify the manner in which the National Archives and Records Administration intends to proceed with the archival processing and release of the tape recordings and all other non-tape Nixon Presidential materials. The current regulations provide that Nixon White House materials will be disclosed to the public in ``integral file segments.'' The concept of integral file segment, although not defined anywhere in the current regulations, is based on standard archival practice, and ordinarily refers to an archival determination that a particular group of processed documents constitutes an intelligible and complete unit for purposes of historical research. Archival determinations of integral file segments may vary significantly both in the quantity of inclusive materials and in the qualitative factors used in determining the components of a particular file segment ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  subject matter, author, time frame, etc.). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Nixon Project draft processing manual indicates that the National Archives and Records Administration intended to process the entire 4,000 hours of tape recordings as one integral file segment. In support of his motion for a preliminary injunction that was issued on August 9, 1993, former President Nixon argued that the draft processing manual, when read in conjunction with the current regulations, prohibits the National Archives and Records Administration from releasing any portion of the tape recordings before the remaining body of the non-restricted tape recordings (other than the approximately 60 hours of WSPF tape segments previously released) is processed and released. Former President Nixon's position is not supported by the realities of processing the materials for public access nor, aside from the provisions of the current regulations and draft processing manual hereby proposed for amendment, supported legally, since it is contrary to other statutory and regulatory obligations of the National Archives and Records Administration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 5 SAPA -- The National Union of  Mineworkers [NUM] said Thursday it was concerned about the role  of South African Police Commissioner Gen Johan van der Merwe and  of Eskom [Electricity Supply Commission] in the aborted sales of  1,000 semi-automatic rifles to KwaZulu Police as revealed by the  Goldstone Commission.    A preliminary hearing by the commission said on Wednesday it  was unfortunate Gen van der Merwe had not consulted Minister of  Law and Order Hernus Kriel before authorising an export permit  for 1,000 LM4 rifles destined for the KwaZulu Police.    The statement issued by the NUM said the Ministry of Law and  Order should curtail the general's powers, which appeared to put  him above the law. NUM said also it seemed as if Eskom  management was making Gen van der Merwe "a sacrifical lamb in an  attempt to hide the real facts".</p>

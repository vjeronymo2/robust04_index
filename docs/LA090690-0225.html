			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST : COMPTON;  </P> <P> COUNCIL HEARS COMPLAINTS ON LIENS FOR WEED CLEANUP  </P> <P> More than 30 disgruntled Compton homeowners packed the City Council chamber  Tuesday to protest liens placed on their properties by the city for weed  cleanup.  </P> <P> Many homeowners said they were not notified that the city was going to clean  their properties.  </P> <P> Some said that they have been billed but that their properties have not been  cleaned. The council said it would check out the complaints.  </P> <P> City Clerk Charles Davis said that all the cases were heard by the Housing  Advisory Appeals Board and that the property owners, many of whom do not live  in the city, were notified by registered mail that they had to clean their  property or the city would do it. Public Works Department officials and private  contractors did the cleanups, Davis said.  </P> <P> Most of the homeowners brought evidence, such as photographs showing that their  yards were clean, to substantiate their claims but public works officials did  not have documentation for the council members.  </P> <P> Davis said that there were more than 500 notices totaling $500,000 in fines and  liens sent out during the summer and that it would involve a lot of work to  review every case.  </P></p>

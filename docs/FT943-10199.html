			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Clarkson may incur Pounds 2m charge Horace Clarkson, the shipping and insurance broking group, is likely to incur a Pounds 2.2m charge in goodwill costs linked to the disposal of its Lloyd's Names business, writes Andrew Jack. Its Horace Holman subsidiary was transferring future work on Estate Protection Plan, a scheme to close off liabilities on open years for Names who have died, to Centrewrite, a Lloyd's-controlled vehicle. Clarkson has also handed over administration of personal stop loss policies arranged by Holman Wade and Carritt &amp; Partners to IRISC London without any payment. Goodwill which had previously been written off against reserves was likely to be reinstated as a charge in the P&amp;L account for the current year. 'This is part of the nationalisation of the relationship with Names. It is natural and evolutionary,' said Mr Robert Ward, finance director.</p>

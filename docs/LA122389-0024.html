			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRISTMAS PAST AND PRESENT  </P> <P> Who can explain it? Each year the wonderful miracle of Christmas is repeated.  It's as if our good God, during this period of time leading up to the birthday  of his son, deluges the earth with his very own spirit of "giving," causing our  selfish human natures to make a 180-degree turn and ask not what I can get but  rather what I can "give" to others.  </P> <P> BROTHER GERARD KEARNS, O.H.  </P> <P> Apple Valley  </P></p>

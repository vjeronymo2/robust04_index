			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG ADVANCE IN GENETIC TREATMENTS REPORTED;  </P> <P> MEDICINE: RESEARCHERS SAY NEW TECHNIQUE COULD ALLOW DOCTORS TO FIGHT DISEASES  SUCH AS MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY SIMPLY BY INJECTING MATERIAL DIRECTLY INTO MUSCLE  TISSUE.  </P> <P> Researchers have developed a revolutionary way to treat genetic diseases that  could greatly accelerate human gene therapy, which has been delayed for a  decade by ethical considerations and technical problems.  </P> <P> Special genetic material would simply be injected into muscle tissue every few  days or weeks in much the same fashion that insulin is now injected daily to  treat diabetes.  </P> <P> The technique, developed by San Diego and Wisconsin scientists, could apply to  a wide range of genetic diseases for which there is now no adequate therapy,  ranging from muscular dystrophy to rare diseases of the immune system.  </P> <P> It might also serve as a way to deliver genetic engineering products, such as  human growth hormone, much more cheaply than is currently possible.  </P> <P> In addition, according to researchers, it could be a valuable tool in the  search for an AIDS vaccine or to help fight infections by the AIDS virus.  </P> <P> Conventional gene therapy involves using genetic-engineering techniques to  replace a defective gene that causes illness with a healthy one. Geneticists  have not yet received approval from regulatory agencies to attempt such therapy  in humans.  </P> <P> Until now, scientists have experimented with replacing defective genes by using  special viruses to insert healthy genetic material into an individual's own  DNA. But researchers and critics have feared that the viruses would insert the  genes at the wrong site in DNA, thereby disrupting healthy genes.  </P> <P> In the surprisingly simple new technique, the researchers would simply inject  specially prepared genetic material into the person's muscle tissue,  stimulating production of an enzyme or protein whose absence is the cause of  the disease. The protein would be carried by the bloodstream to body tissues  where it is needed.  </P> <P> Because a virus is not used, the injected material would pose no risk to the  recipient's genes.  </P> <P> The added genetic material would break down in a period of days to weeks, so  the genetic therapy would be reversible if adverse effects should appear.  </P> <P> The researchers, from Vical Inc. in San Diego and the University of Wisconsin  Medical Center in Madison, report in today's Science magazine that they have  used the technique successfully to produce proteins in mice. They hope to  extend the studies to humans within five years, most likely for the treatment  of muscular dystrophy.  </P> <P> "We are ushering in a very major change . . . that is going to push gene  therapy ahead much faster in the next decade," said biochemist Philip L.  Felgner of Vical.  </P> <P> Although the researchers were looking for a way to introduce genetic  information into cells, their discovery was serendipitous.  </P> <P> Felgner and his colleagues were working with messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA),  which serves as a sort of working copy of the genetic information contained in  DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) that is used by the cell's protein-making  machinery.  </P> <P> The mRNA has certain potential therapeutic applications in its own right, and  many laboratories are looking for ways to get it inside cells. Vical has been  working with liposomes, microscopic globules of fat that would encase the mRNA  and carry it into cells. To test how well the liposomes worked, researchers  decided to inject naked mRNA into tissues, assuming that none of it would make  it into cells.  </P> <P> They were wrong.  </P> <P> The naked mRNA was taken up by the cells faster than the mRNA in liposomes. "I  didn't believe it at first," said medical geneticist Jon A. Wolff of Wisconsin.  "It was a total surprise," Felgner added. "Nobody would have even thought to  (try it)."  </P> <P> After they convinced themselves that the mRNA was being taken up, research  progressed rapidly. "The procedure is extremely simple," Felgner said. "It's  simple to administer the mRNA, and it's simple to make it. It's straightforward  molecular biology."  </P> <P> They do have to modify the mRNA, though. Special segments of RNA must be added  to the ends of the RNA gene for the cells to make proteins from it. Additional  segments must be added if the cells are to secrete the proteins into the  bloodstream.  </P> <P> The mRNA is broken down and absorbed by the cells within two or three days, so  continuous replacement is necessary. But Felgner and Wolff have been able to  circumvent that problem by modifying the genetic information so that it  persists for as long as six months.  </P> <P> One of the most promising uses of the technique might be for treating muscular  dystrophy, which causes progressive weakening and wasting of muscles. About one  in every 3,500 males develops the disease.  </P> <P> Researchers discovered two years ago that the muscle cells of muscular  dystrophy victims lack a specific protein, called dystrophin, that is necessary  for muscle function. Felgner speculates that the new technique could readily be  used to have muscle cells produce the protein right where it is needed. He is  now preparing experiments in which the dystrophin gene will be injected into  dystrophic mice, and hopes to have them completed by the end of the year.  </P> <P> The technique theoretically could also be used to treat any genetic disease  requiring that a protein or enzyme be released into the blood. In one type of  rare immunodeficiency disease that genetic engineers are contemplating  treating, for example, the victims are missing a crucial enzyme called  adenosine deaminase.  </P> <P> Felgner speculates that such a condition could be treated easily with the new  technique, so that muscle cells would secrete the missing enzyme.  </P> <P> Other missing hormones and biological agents that now must be injected on a  regular basis, such as human growth hormone, could be produced in the same  fashion. Because injections of a plasmid would be required only every six  months or so, rather than daily or several times a week, the cost would be  greatly reduced.  </P> <P> The technique probably could not be used for treating diabetes, however,  because the production of insulin must be much more closely regulated than is  possible in muscle cells.  </P> <P> Finally, the technique could be used to produce vaccines against the AIDS virus  and others. If muscle cells could be induced to produce certain AIDS proteins,  speculated immunologist Howard Gray of Cytel Corp. in San Diego, a much more  effective immune response would be produced against the virus.  </P></p>

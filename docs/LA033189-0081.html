			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHEZ FRANCOIS: COOKING ON ANOTHER LEVEL  </P> <P> There are restaurants atop skyscrapers that command colossal views. Chez  Francois is a restaurant at the bottom of a skyscraper, the C-floor basement of  Arco Plaza, and it has only mock windows, recessed portions of wall with coyly  swagged drapes but no glass. Just as well; if you could see through these  "windows," the view would be strictly subsoil.  </P> <P> It's a very pleasant place, though, from the cavelike corridor, to the clubby  bar, to the dining room with its pretty floral display. Ryo Sato must like it.  He was the chef here years ago, before opening his own Chez Sateau in Arcadia.  Now he has bought the place where he used to work, though he apparently  recognizes the handicaps of the basement location, since he only opens it for  lunch.  </P> <P> Sato has one of the most distinctive cooking styles around, but one of the  hardest to characterize. His menus are full of dishes you've never had, but  somehow the more inventive he gets, the closer the result is to the old  French-Continental tradition. It's solid, skilled cooking, but it combines an  apparently random alteration of tradition with a near avoidance of flashy  effects, as if it were unmannerly to be memorable.  </P> <P> Typical of both his strong and his weak points is gazpacho de crevettes.  Charcoal grilled shrimp rest on a cold tomato puree enriched with cream; it  would be wonderful by itself, but little spoonfuls of zucchini puree have been  added for one more texture, color and flavor. Unfortunately, it's a mushy  texture, a drab color and a regrettable flavor.  </P> <P> One of the memorable dishes is a roast saddle of lamb with a simple dressing of  lamb juices and rosemary. The lamb is covered with watercress and rests on a  fried cake of sliced potato -- it's wonderfully smoky. In its way, the breast  of duck with orange and cherry sauce (the flavors blend surprisingly well) is  memorable too. It comes with a wild rice pilaf mixed with bits of bacon, which  is very good, and some delicious brandied cherries (though I am still unable to  fathom the thrill of eating hot food with raw alcohol in it).  </P> <P> More typical is Rex sole with butter, lime and caper sauce with tiny,  peppercorn-sized croutons of egg bread and a lot of butter. Or large green  ravioli with a tiny bit of duck and shiitake mushroom filling, arranged on top  of a mound of spinach pasta with some sweet red pepper sauce around it -- sweet  red pepper sauce being the mildest of '80s novelties.  </P> <P> Among the usual pastry selection of black forest cake, Grand Marnier cake  (actually, lighter and finer than most) and so forth, there is an unexpected  winner at dessert time. It's a marzipan cake that looks oddly like a slice  through a hamburger: the "patty " actually being chocolate; the "catsup" layer,  strawberry; and the puffy "bun," cream. The marzipan layer is what looks like  the brownish crust of the bun, and it's surprisingly moist and luscious.  </P> <P> Now, that's worth going down in the basement for.  </P> <P>  Chez Francois, C-floor, Arco Plaza, 505 S. Flower St., L.A. (213) 680- 2727.  Open for lunch Monday through Friday. Full bar. Validated parking at 400 S.  Flower lot. All major credit cards accepted.

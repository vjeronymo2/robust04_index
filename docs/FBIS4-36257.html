			<p>BFN     [Text] Knesset Member [MK] Begin raised the suspicion that  an excerpt has been omitted from Foreign Minister Peres' letter  to Norwegian Foreign Minister Holst on the Jerusalem issue. MK  Begin told Qol Yisra'el that the second clause in the letter  does not follow from the first clause, and unless this is a mere  stylistic defect, it is possible that a clause has been omitted.    Foreign Minister Peres reacted to this charge by saying that  no clause has been omitted and the entire letter was published  verbatim. Mr. Peres added that the Likud people realize that  the letter does not harm Jerusalem's status in any way  whatsoever, therefore they pick at it and raise false charges.</p>

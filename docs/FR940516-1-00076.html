			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Selection of the Format of the Proposed Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The formats of the proposed standards were selected in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to give facilities the most flexibility possible in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieving the level of control required by the selected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory alternative. Because the MACT floor for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater portion of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source reflects control by various methods, the format needs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to allow sufficient flexibility for facilities to meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level of the standard using the various control methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already in place to the extent possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the formats considered (mass emission limits,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent concentration, percent reduction, equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards, work practice standards), the mass emission limit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> format was chosen because various combinations of controls  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can be employed among several emission points to achieve the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same mass emission rate. Also, mass emission limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encourage facilities to reduce emissions through process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes, work practice changes, and other methods to avoid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costly add-on controls. In this way, mass emission limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serve to encourage pollution prevention. An equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard format is not needed for this source because an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission limit can be established. Formats such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifying a concentration or a percent reduction, offer no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advantages over the emission limit format, and would be more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cumbersome from an enforcement standpoint due to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different characteristics of the emission points that make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> up the source of process vents, storage tanks, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For process vent, storage tank, and wastewater emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> points within new sources, however, equipment standards have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been proposed. An emission limit format cannot be used for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these emission points within new sources because it would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identify specific facilities' production levels, which are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimed as confidential business information. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities would have the opportunity to employ other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologies to meet the standard by demonstrating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA solicits comments on the equipment standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> format of the standards for process vents, storage tanks,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and wastewater at new facilities. In particular, the EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solicits comments on whether performance standards for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vents, tanks, and wastewater at new facilities can be used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without compromising confidential business information and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether operators can comply with performance standards for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vents, tanks, and wastewater at new facilities without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compromising confidential business information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The LDAR program of 40 CFR part 63, subpart H is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combination of an equipment standard/work practice format.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 112 of the Act, national emission standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must, whenever possible, take the format of a numerical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission standard. Typically, an emission standard is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written in terms of an allowable emission rate, performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level, or allowable concentration. These types of standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require the direct measurement of emissions to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance. For some emission points, emission standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cannot be prescribed because it is not feasible to measure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions. Section 112(h)(2) recognizes this situation by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defining two conditions under which it is not feasible to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish an emission standard. These conditions are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) If the pollutants cannot be emitted through a conveyance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed and constructed to emit or capture the pollutant;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or (2) if the application of measurement methodology is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practicable due to technological and economic limitations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If an emission standard cannot be established, the EPA may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instead establish a design, equipment, work practice, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operational standard or combination thereof.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For equipment leak emission points, such as pumps and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valves, EPA has previously determined that it is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feasible to prescribe or enforce emission standards. Except  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for those items of equipment for which standards can be set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at a specific concentration, the only method of measuring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions is total enclosure of individual items of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment, collection of emissions for a specified time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period, and measurement of the emissions. This procedure,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> known as bagging, is a time-consuming and prohibitively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expensive technique considering the great number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual items of equipment in a typical process unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, this procedure would not be useful for routine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring and identification of leaking equipment for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repair. Therefore, LDAR program of 40 CFR, subpart H, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment/work practice standard, was chosen for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment leaks emission point.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Selection of Compliance and Performance Testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Provisions and Monitoring Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulation contains compliance provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that require owners or operators to conduct an initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance test to demonstrate compliance with the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. As a means of demonstrating compliance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards following the initial performance test, the owner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or operator must also establish source-specific parameters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on the characteristics of the emission stream,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process, or type of control device used. The Administrator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined that these provisions were necessary to meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring requirements of the General Provisions (40 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part 63, subpart A).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

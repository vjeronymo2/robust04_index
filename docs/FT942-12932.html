			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Banesto bolsters Banco Santander's ambitions - The bank sees the purchase as providing a balance Mr Emilio Botn, chairman of Banco Santander, was once accused by a shareholder at the bank's annual meeting being too conservative. 'There are only two kinds of bankers,' he retorted, 'conservative bankers and bad bankers.' There were many analysts yesterday who wondered whether the third generation Botn to preside over Santander's fortunes might have transformed his family's reputation from one category to the other by paying Pta281bn (Dollars 2.05bn) for Banesto. The purchase comes at a critical time in Santander's quest to become the best diversified Spanish commercial bank. It is seeking to balance income streams equally between domestic and foreign business, and commercial and investment banking. The bank directors argued yesterday that Banesto would be a critical element in establishing that balance. Yet doubters said its ambition to become Spain's largest bank could have influenced its judgment of Banesto's true value. Santander paid more than last week's trading value in its bid of Pta762 a share. 'Everyone said Banesto's market price was ridiculous, and Botn has gone and paid more than the market,' said Mr Derek Bullman, a James Capel analyst. Mr Gary Weiss, director of the team at Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank, that advised Banco Bilbao Vizcaya on its bid of Pta667 a share, described the disparity between the bids for Banesto as 'a bit surprising'. Since 1989, when it broke the Spanish interest rate cartel which prevented competition between banks to gather deposits, Santander has struggled to establish itself alongside rivals such as BBV and Banco Central Hispano in retail banking. At the same time, it has tried to build up international businesses. It has done so by expanding its network in Latin America, devoting resources to investment banking, and forming alliances with groups such as Royal Bank of Scotland. Yet its directors argue that it was in danger of achieving its hoped-for balance too quickly by virtue of weakness in Spain. Its income from abroad was 42 per cent of the total last year, and was likely to be 50 per cent this year. In spite of the drive to gather more deposits through its small network of 1,300 branches, it had raised its market share of deposits, mutual funds and pension funds only from 5.19 per cent in December 1990 to 5.85 per cent this January. 'It took us four years of enormous effort doing whatever was imaginable in terms of aggressiveness and innovation to raise our share by 1 per cent,' said Mr Matias Rodriguez Inciarte, Santander chief financial officer. This is the reason for Santander displaying such interest in Banesto, which despite its problems with lending which led to the replacement of the previous management, has a strong loyalty among customers in Spanish rural areas. 'We had started to ponder whether, if we stayed as we were, too much of our income would come from foreign activities, and this re-establishes the balance. Being a Spanish bank, half our income should come from there,' says Mr Inciarte. Santander and Banesto together will now have a 9.7 per cent market share in deposits as well as 11.9 per cent of branches and 10.2 per cent of loans. Mr Inciarte argues that Banesto can improve deposit taking even further. 'We have our hands full of things that we can do at Banesto to improve the bottom line,' he says. He summarises strategy as 'savings, savings, savings,' arguing that staff must be trained to expand lending without taking excessive risk. Santander is also likely to transform Banesto decisively into a pure retail bank by shedding the portfolio of equity stakes in industrial companies over the next two years, starting with its investments in media groups. Nonetheless, Banesto's retail bank will have to perform better to recoup some of the 15 per cent dilution of earnings per share created by the transaction even before the planned Pta89bn rights issue. Mr Inciarte emphasises the importance he attaches to the repeated re-examination of Banesto's assets over the past two years by the Bank of Spain, and under Mr Alfredo Saez, the BBV executive who will be retained as Banesto chairman. Apart from trying to sell more products, raising Banesto's net interest margin from 2.7 per cent closer to Santander's 5.7 per cent, the emphasis will be on cutting costs. Some of this may be achieved by combining central functions. Although an obvious way to achieve big cost cuts would be to merge the banks, Mr Inciarte says this will not happen at least in the short term. However, he says that lending to large companies by the two banks could be merged. Mr Inciarte expresses optimism that Santander can achieve benefits beyond the minimum projections presented to fund managers yesterday. He describes the return even on the 'very conservative' Saenz projections as 'very acceptable'. Yet Santander has a task on its hands to persuade others that its judgment was not swayed by the wish to be big. Until Banesto starts to perform like the bank it envisages, Mr Botn's remark may hang uneasily over his head. Lex, Page 24</p>

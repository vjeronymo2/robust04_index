			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: US bonds The hunt for US inflationary demons will reach a peak of activity this week. Producer and consumer price figures for February, followed by the monthly report of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve, are likely to contain at least one scrap of data to suggest that inflationary pressure is growing. That points to another difficult week for US bonds, which on the basis of recent experience would send ripples through European markets too. True, bears of US Treasuries have had precious little real evidence to chew on since Mr Alan Greenspan launched his pre-emptive strike on inflation by raising short-term rates. But it is a measure of the heightened sensitivity that indicators which would normally be given scant attention - such as the National Association of Purchasing Managers price index and the Philadelphia Fed report - have been thrust to centre stage. Besides, there is more to the nervous state of the bond market than the immediate economic indicators. Last week's tumble had more to do with President Clinton's growing embarrassment over Whitewater, which is unlikely to be relieved quickly. Politics aside, calm will only be restored when bond market investors have a clearer view of Mr Greenspan's intentions from here on. That will probably take either another rise in short-term rates - already priced into bond yields - or evidence that the US economy has slowed decisively from the heady growth rate achieved in the final quarter of last year. Until that happens, US Treasuries remain in danger of being spooked by shadows.</p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: UK dividends In yesterday's speech to the CBI, Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury, ruled out heavy-handed government measures to restrict dividend payments. But he left the way open for tax reforms to improve the efficiency of capital markets. The Treasury remains concerned about the growth of dividends through recession, since that could imply that equity is losing its role as a shock absorber in times of financial strain. Reforms which encouraged fund managers to invest in bonds for income and equities for capital growth might help. It is striking that UK pension funds still hold on average less than 10 per cent of assets in fixed-interest securities, compared with over 50 per cent in the US. If the government could encourage institutions to buy bonds or preference shares, some of the pressure for ever-rising dividends might be relieved. A more liquid corporate bond market on the US model might also develop. That would provide medium-sized companies with access to term debt. Yet it is far from clear how all this might be achieved. Measures which made equities less attractive as a source of income for institutions - by again reducing the tax credit available to gross funds on dividends, for example - would provoke a furious response. If the government is serious about tilting the balance of investment away from equities the real answer is to keep a firmer grip on inflation than has hitherto been the case.</p>

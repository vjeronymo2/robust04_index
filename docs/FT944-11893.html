			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of UK Consumer Credit and Asset Finance (8): Range of participants widens - The industry / A look at the range of finance companies Would you buy a car through a merchant bank? Would you ask the people who make or sell your television set for a loan? Though the instinctive answer to both questions is 'probably not', the percentage of individuals and businesses who respond positively demonstrates the wide range of companies in the consumer credit and asset finance industry. A glance down the membership list of the Finance and Leasing Association reveals some implausible participants: the Automobile Association, Kodak, Marks and Spencer, and Rank Xerox are all among the organisations with offshoots in this area of finance. This does not mean, however, that these or the more predictable financial institutions in this sector are all in direct competition. Rather, it reflects the varied types of finance with which the sector deals. At one end of the scale are the unsecured personal loans - perhaps with a minimum of Pounds 500 - offered by all the leading high street financial institutions. At the other end are the asset finance arrangements set up by merchant banks as part of the financing services they provide to their large corporate clients. 'We have done tiny, tiny deals as favours,' says Andrew White, joint head of financing at Kleinwort Benson where the main lines of asset finance are in the vehicle, information technology and aerospace markets. 'But ideally we don't want to do a deal below Pounds 2m.' Between these extremes is a range of finance where there is room for mainstream providers and companies which have identified specific niches to win substantial shares of relatively narrow markets. For example, First National Bank, the core consumer finance arm of First National Finance Corporation, specialises in providing suppliers of home improvement goods and services with financing deals they can offer customers at the point of sale. Point-of-sale finance is just one way in which competition to provide or arrange finance between merchandisers as well as to provide the more conventional sources of funds is intensifying. Take the case of someone buying a new kitchen or double glazing. These customers might think first of obtaining finance from the bank or building society with which they deal. But they are also potential financial clients for the retailer or manufacturer from whom they are buying. The principles are the same in corporate business. A company replacing a fleet of cars might consider approaching the merchant bank which advises it about the other aspects of its financial arrangements, but, equally, will face a determined effort from motor companies to win its business. The varied backgrounds and structures of consumer finance organisations enables them to put forward different selling spiels, from convenience to financial expertise or long experience in the goods or services being sought. All the largest clearing banks have their own finance houses through which they offer leasing and structured finance for personal customers and small businesses, directly or through the bank itself. The growing importance of finance houses is illustrated by their increasing contribution to bank profits. In turn, the finance houses believe that being part of a larger banking group can also assist their business. For example, Forward Trust, Midland Bank's finance house, says the main benefit is in the competitive and attractive funding rates it can offer as part of the larger organisation. Less important, there is also the prospect of referrals from customers who approach the banks through its branches. Like the finance houses in the banks, consumer finance arms of building societies say that their position in the group gives them the benefit not just of the scale of inquiries but also of the brand name. 'Customers know and trust the organisation,' says Richard Roche, head of marketing at Alliance &amp; Leicester Personal Finance. There is, however, a restriction on the type of consumer finance building societies can offer. Although relaxations in rules are on the way, at present societies cannot lend for business purposes. This can lead to difficult decisions in dealing with sole traders. A taxi driver applying for a car loan would have to be turned down if it was obvious that the vehicle would be used for business, but a plumber wishing to buy a car would be eligible for a loan unless the vehicle was primarily for business use. Different restrictions can apply where a consumer finance arm is part of a broader organisation. At Marks and Spencer, for example, the financial services operation is expanding next year to add life insurance and pensions to the charge cards, personal loans and unit trusts it already offers. But earlier this year, Keith Oates, joint managing director, stressed: 'We are first and foremost a retailer. Our financial services arm ought to be allowed to expand as it thinks fit without disturbing the plan for the whole group.' Ford Credit, part of the financial services subsidiary of Ford Motors, readily acknowledges it is a 'captive'. It says, however, that this does not unduly hamper its operation or development. Under the terms of the European Second Banking Co-ordination Directive it is a bank in its own right, and in 1993 it was among the top 10 finance houses in the UK. Whatever their parent organisations, consumer credit and asset finance operations face opportunities and challenges in the months ahead. The good news is that much of it should benefit from the recovery as businesses re-tool for expansion: in particular, the car market generally responds quickly to growth in the economy. What is not such good news is that margins are narrowing. As one asset financier put it: 'Foreign competitors are coming back to the UK market a bit early, there are not enough deals to go round, and so they cut prices to buy volume.'</p>

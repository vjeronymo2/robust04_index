			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PLAGUE DANGER CITED  </P> <P> A campground in the Angeles National Forest has been closed to allow health  officials to control an outbreak of an animal disease that shows up as bubonic  plague in humans, authorities said Wednesday. A ground squirrel found in the  Table Mountain Campground about four miles west of Wrightwood has tested  positive for sylvatic, or animal, plague, Los Angeles County health officials  said. The disease is a bacterial infection affecting wild animals -- especially  ground squirrels -- and can be transmitted to humans by means of a flea bite.  In humans, plague symptoms include enlargement of lymph glands near the bite,  followed by fever and chills. It can be fatal if left untreated.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FERRARE TO SKIP 'HOME'  </P> <P> Cristina Ferrare has decided not to return to ABC's "Home Show" in order to  spend more time with her newborn daughter, an ABC spokeswoman announced Monday.  </P> <P> "I love the 'Home Show' and all the people involved, but because I have to be  up at 4:30 a.m. every day, I couldn't see the new baby until the afternoon,"  Ferrare said through the ABC spokeswoman. "I really want to be with her, as  well as my 2-year-old daughter."  </P> <P> Arthur Gregory, Ferrare's manager, said that his client decided very recently  that the demands of co-hosting the "Home Show," as well as "A.M. Los Angeles,"  were too time consuming.  </P> <P> He said Ferrare will continue as co-host with Steve Edwards of "A.M. Los  Angeles," where she returned to work Monday after a five-week maternity leave.  </P> <P> Ferrare first appeared on the "Home Show" with Robb Weller on Jan. 16 and left  March 9, the day her daughter, Arianna, was born.  </P> <P> The ABC spokeswoman said the "Home Show" would continue to have rotating guest  hosts.

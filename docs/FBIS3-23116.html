			<p>Article   Type:BFN   <F P=106> [See SELECTED VIDEO REPORTS in the front of this Terrorism </F> Report for TV coverage of this incident]    [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at  1540 GMT on 25 February carries live interviews with Ministers  Sarid and Shahal who formulated the announcement issued by the  government at the end of its special meeting today.    In the course of his interview, Minister Sarid expresses his  belief that an inquiry commission should be set up, as proposed  in the cabinet meeting, stressing though that "there is no doubt  that today's murder was carried out by a single individual who  acted alone. He was the only shooter." As for how he managed  to carry out his act in the Cave of the Patriarchs unhindered by  the Army, Sarid says: "An explanation was given by the Army. I  believe it should be given by the Army. There was a door there  which should have been locked, and the officer who was in charge  of the scene at the time tried to enter the prayer hall but was  pushed back by the crowd of worshippers who fled outside."  Minister Sarid also emphasizes the decision by the commander of  the Central Command, as reported to the cabinet today, on the  curfew imposed on Jews in Hebron "who are allowed to move freely  only in their area of residence, but, for the first time, are  not allowed to enter the town of Hebron. As for Qiryat Arba',  the closure means it is possible to enter and exit Qiryat Arba'  only at a special request for permission from the IDF."    During his interview, Police Minister Shahal is asked  whether  today's incident is not the result of police's helplessness in  enforcing the law on the settlers, specifically Kakh members.  He responded that the police are not responsible for public  order in the territories at all. Still, in its capacity of  opening files against criminals, the police does so when  evidence is collected, but "there was no concrete material"  against this morning's murderer.

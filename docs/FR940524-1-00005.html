			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments received pursuant to the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking concerning &sect;&sect;201.17, 201.45, 201.81, 201.95 and 203.17 were generally in support of retaining each in its present form. No comments were received concerning &sect;&sect;201.1, 201.3, 201.39, 201.44, and 203.12.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two comments were received concerning modification of &sect;201.2. This regulation defines certain unique terms used in the P&amp;S Act and regulations. Both comments came from livestock producer associations and recommended that video and other forms of electronic marketing be defined. All forms of electronic marketing generally operate as market agencies selling on commission and are subject to all requirements of the P&amp;S Act and regulations relating to such entities. Therefore, it has been determined that further definition is unnecessary at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One thousand three hundred and thirty-three (1,333) comments were received concerning &sect;201.82. This regulation requires reasonable care and prompt handling of livestock and live poultry to prevent excessive shrink, injury, death or other avoidable loss. Comments were received from 1,306 individuals not identified as producers or as members of any organization, 8 animal welfare groups, 11 livestock producer and trade associations, 5 livestock producers, 1 individual representing livestock marketing interests, 1 association of veterinarians and 1 State Department of Agriculture. More than 1,300 comments recommended amending this regulation to prohibit the sale of downed animals at stockyards, 26 proposed amending it to require stockyards to humanely euthanize downed animals, 1 recommended that the Agency issue a policy statement with guidelines on care and handling of livestock, 12 supported this regulation in its present form, 1 opposed placing regulation of care and handling of downed livestock under Agency authority and another recommended that the regulation be amended to clarify that its purpose is to prevent economic loss to livestock sellers and not to further animal welfare interests. Ten other comments generally supported broader authority over the care and handling of livestock.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency has considered all of the comments concerning &sect;201.82 and determined that concerns about the care and handling of livestock at stockyards can be addressed more effectively in a separate rulemaking. Therefore, this document proposes to retain &sect;201.82 in its present form. The Agency will propose an additional rule, which is currently being drafted, concerning the care and handling of livestock to be published in a separate docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eighty-five comments were received concerning &sect;201.86. This regulation sets forth procedures for authorizations to charge and collect fees for inspection of brands. Comments were received from 73 livestock producers, 4 livestock producer associations, 3 attorneys, 2 individuals not identified as members of any organization, 2 law enforcement associations, and 1 bank. Eighty-four comments supported the regulation in its present form. One comment expressed concern that Section 317 of the P&amp;S Act (7 U.S.C. 217a) limits collection of brand inspection fees at stockyards to livestock originating within the State and recommended &sect;201.86 be amended to allow inspection of all livestock sold within the State be done in accordance with the State law where the livestock are sold.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

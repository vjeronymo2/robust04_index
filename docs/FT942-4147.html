			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Lyonnaise des Eaux in protest at bribes allegations Mr Jerome Monod, president of Lyonnaise des Eaux, yesterday threatened legal action against Mr Thierry Jean-Pierre, a magistrate running in tomorrow's European Parliament election, for alleging that Lyonnaise used bribes to win water contracts and covered the cost by raising water charges to consumers, David Buchan writes from Paris. Mr Monod made his threat after anxious questioning about the 'political corruption' allegations by some shareholders at Lyonnaise's annual general meeting on Thursday and a slide on the same day in the share price of Lyonnaise and also that of Generale des Eaux, the other big French utility and communications group to be the target of Mr Jean-Pierre's recent allegations in local and international newspapers. Generale des Eaux asked the COB, which regulates the Paris Bourse, to put trading in its shares under surveillance. Mr Monod told his shareholders that he 'could not prevent the subsidiaries (of Lyonnaise des Eauxz) from doing what is possible, permitted and solicited with insistence' by political parties. Lyonnaise argues that the differences in water charges across France reflect differences in costs and that the tariffs are in any case under the control of local authorities with which Lyonnaise has its contracts.</p>

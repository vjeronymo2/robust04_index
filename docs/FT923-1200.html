			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Smiths Industries buys medical group SMITHS INDUSTRIES, the UK-based aerospace electronics, medical systems and specialised industrial components group, is buying Intertech Resources, a privately held US disposable medical products company, for Dollars 110m (Pounds 64.3m). Smiths' share price fell 6p to close at 308p. The cash purchase, which includes the assumption of Dollars 18m debt, will significantly expand Smiths' existing medical products business, while also adding to the group's US operations. Smiths' is one of the world's leading suppliers of disposable medical products and has significant market shares in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Intertech is a large supplier of 'single-use' anaesthesia and respiratory devices used in surgery and intensive care. It reported an operating profit of Dollars 8m before interest of Dollars 1.6m on sales of Dollars 43.5m in the year to June 30. It ended the period with assets of Dollars 24.4m. Commenting on the acquisition Mr Roger Hurn, Smiths' chairman, said: 'Intertech is a strong company with highly respected brands. I expect the company to make an early contribution to profits after financing costs.' Smiths, which had net cash of Pounds 95m at the beginning of February, had been expected to continue diversifying from defence and civil aerospace. Mr Hurn hinted at an acquisition in April when he told analysts that the group's management was ready for 'a major challenge'. Intertech employs 450 people. Its headquarters are in Chicago, but its main operations are in Fort Myers, Florida. Almost 90 per cent of its sales are derived from its own production and its products are sold in the US healthcare market directly and through distributors. The acquisition, subject to US anti-trust clearance, will boost Smiths' growing Medical Systems division which had sales of Pounds 125.3m in the 1990-91 financial year. In the latest six-month period to February 1 the division accounted for 31 per cent of the group's Pounds 37.8m trading profits and 21 per cent of its Pounds 307.4m half-year turnover. The US company will join Smiths' existing medical operations in North America which include disposable devices for intensive therapy, blood gas sampling kits, and monitors for body temperature.</p>

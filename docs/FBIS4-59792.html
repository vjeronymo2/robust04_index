			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 16, IRNA -- Ministry of Defence and  Armed Forces Logistics here Monday rejected a claim printed in  U.S. daily THE WASHINGTON POST on sending explosives to Zagreb  and described it as a new plot of U.S. media against the world  Muslims.    THE WASHINGTON POST in its Friday issue quoted an unknown  source, saying that using a jumbo jet to fly between Iran and  Zagreb, Iran has transfered to Zagreb 60 tons of explosives and  raw materials used in manufacturing arms.    Issuing a statement, the ministry said that the plots of the  arrogant world media are merely aimed at tarnishing the humane  image of the Islamic Republic of Iran.    Iran's Red Crescent Society (IRCS) has extended a large  amount of relief aid to Bosnian Muslims since the start of the  war between the Muslims and the Serbs.    The Islamic Republic of Iran recently opened its embassy in  Sarajevo, the city which was under Serbian siege for a long  time. Opening of Iranian Embassy in Sarajevo created a condition  in which the Muslims and Croats reached understanding and  created co-existence in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The Ministry of Defence and the Armed Forces Logistics said  that raising such baseless claims especially at the time of  opening of Iranian Embassy in Sarajevo and the announcement of  Iran's repeated declaration of readiness to send 10,000 troops  under the United Nations peace keeping force (UNPROFOR) to  Bosnia are attempts to prevent Iran's diplomatic moves to end  the massacre of the oppressed Muslims in Bosnia.</p>

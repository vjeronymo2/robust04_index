			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / International Company News: Former Kidder chief to run Travelers unit Mr Michael Carpenter, the former chairman of Kidder Peabody who was ousted from the US investment bank earlier this year, re-emerged yesterday in a senior position at Travelers, the broad-based financial services group. The British-born executive will run Travelers' life insurance and annuity businesses, which the company said would generate premiums this year of more than Dollars 2bn. He has also been named an executive vice-president of the group, making him one of Travelers' most senior executives. The company said he would work closely with Mr Sanford Weill, who has assembled the Travelers group through a series of acquisitions, on planning and strategy issues. Mr Carpenter had been chairman and chief executive of Kidder for nearly five years, and had been responsible for attempts to transform the General Electric subsidiary into a big bond trading house. Kidder eventually foundered on the discovery of what it claimed was a big bond trading fraud, and on the collapse in bond markets earlier this year.</p>

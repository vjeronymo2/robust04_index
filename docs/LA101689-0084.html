			<p><P> October 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Huntsman Bids for Aristech Chemical: A group led by Salt Lake City  industrialist Jon Huntsman has offered to acquire Pittsburgh's Aristech  Chemical Corp. for $25 a share, or about $817.5 million. Aristech Chemical  became a publicly held company in December, 1986, after it was spun off from  USX Corp.'s chemical division. Huntsman, chairman and chief executive of  Huntsman Chemical Corp., already controls about 7% of Aristech. Aristech could  not be reached for comment. But a spokesman for Huntsman Chemical said  Aristech's board will "consider the friendly offer, which is subject to certain  conditions and will make a response at the appropriate time."  </P></p>

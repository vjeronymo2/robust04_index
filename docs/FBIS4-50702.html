			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Tightening Monetary Policy Cools Inflation"] </F>   [Text] The State clampdown on fixed-assets investment  helped take the air out of China's ballooning inflation rate in  April, the Statistics Bureau said yesterday.    In its monthly report, the bureau said retail prices soared  20 per cent during the first four months of this year compared  to the same period last year.    But in April alone, retail prices rose 19.6 percent, down  from 24.5 percent in March.    And increases in consumer prices, including the service  sector, dropped 0.7 percent in April to stand at 21.7 percent,  the report added.    The bureau noted that government controls also throttled  soaring service prices, including the catering trade,  transportation, and financial business.    Bureau economists say spiralling prices are being kept at  bay  in the 36 major cities, typically reflected by consumer  expenditures on vegetables and services.    But, they also warned that consumer prices in small cities,  towns, and rural areas were still on the rise, particularly for  grain, seafood, clothes, and services.    The bureau suggested the government keep a firm grip on the  economy to ensure a general balance between supply and demand of  goods on the market--a crucial factor in stabilizing prices.    While strengthening its controls on money supply to avoid  runaway investment in fixed assets, creditors are expected to  focus on key state projects, industrial firms, and agricultural  production, the bureau added.    Last month, fixed-assets investment by State units was 55.4  billion yuan ($6.4 billion), up 44.2 percent from the same  period of last year.    But this represented a fall in the growth rate. In April  1993 fixed-assets investment grew 66.1 percent compared to the  year before.    Since the clampdown on fixed assets began last year, the  government has effectively cut the money supply to  machine-building, textiles, and construction of villas and  hotels.    The development has helped bring a 22 percent increase to  the  state revenue this year.    Strict control over the money supply, which severely hurt  the  state industries in the first quarter, brought a glimmer of hope  for them to recover production strength last month.    Backed by state financial support, the state-owned  enterprises, considered the country's industrial pillar,  generated 84.7 billion yuan ($9.7 billion) in profits and taxes  during the first four months of this year. That's up 22.1  percent from the same period last year.    In the first quarter, state-owned factories output grew only  2.2 percent. But in April, it went up to 5 percent.    The bureau added that national industrial output nearly hit  171 billion yuan ($19.6 billion) in April, up 17.9 percent from  the same period last year.    After taking inflation into account, domestic retail sales  increased 4 percent in April to reach 117 billion yuan ($13.4  billion).</p>

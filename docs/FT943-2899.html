			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Rutland at Pounds 4.5m and plans expansion Rutland Trust, the financial and business services group, boosted pre-tax profits by 23 per cent for the six months to June 30. They rose from Pounds 3.64m to Pounds 4.48m on turnover of Pounds 55m (Pounds 50.5m). Mr Michael Langdon, chief executive, said the results were on target. The group has more than Pounds 15m in cash in addition to its 42 per cent stake in Capital Industries, the laminated paper maker. This is on the books at Pounds 7.6m, but has a market value of Pounds 22m. 'We have significant financial flexibility with which to take the business forward,' said Mr Langdon yesterday. The group was actively looking for acquisitions. Operating profits from the corporate finance and investment division rose from Pounds 704,000 to Pounds 1.36m, mainly representing the contribution from Capital Industries. The contribution from Ben Shaw's, the Huddersfield soft drinks and water business, was marginal, but is expected to be better in the second half following the hot summer. Earlier this year Rutland sold part of Ben Shaw's Pontefract canning line to Cott Corporation, a Canadian group which provides own-label colas for supermarkets. A further exceptional gain of about Pounds 2.7m is expected in the second half from the sale. The asset financing division, which is involved in vehicle contract hire, almost quadrupled profits to Pounds 2.04m (Pounds 536,000) on the back of new business won and an increase in the value of second-hand cars. Profits from professional services retreated from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 1.08m, reflecting a cyclical setback at Ellis &amp; Buckle, the chartered loss adjuster. However, the group believes Ellis will emerge from the downturn 'as one of the pre-eminent loss adjusters.' Earnings per share rose from 0.93p to 1.08p. The interim dividend is 0.30p (0.27p).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Europe Is a House Without Windows"] </F>   [Text] Brussels has caught the British disease: obsessive  secrecy. Unlike the UK, information still emerges there because  it is frequently in the self-interest of member states to leak  their "reasonable" arguments -- and the "unreasonable" positions  of their opponents. But leaks come with much spin and heavy  bias. What is missing is a public right to know -- which would  provide access to briefing documents so that there could be  unbiased accounts of what is happening. A new era of openness  was supposed to have begun in January. Both the Maastricht and  Copenhagen summits embraced the idea of freedom of information.  Hail transparency! The Brussels bureaucracy obliged with codes  of conduct, rules and regulations supposed to open the European  Union's windows. Out went the old approach: everything is  secret unless a decision is taken to make it available. In came  the new: everything is accessible, unless there are good  reasons to withhold it. Yet, at its first test, the new system  has collapsed. A request from our European Affairs Editor in  Brussels for a series of background documents on different  decisions has ended in farce.    A few documents were initially released. We obtained the  documents behind Britain's controversial opt-out from the  European directive to protect child workers, but were denied all  papers concerning the Justice Council. Yet the grounds on which  access was denied -- that the papers included official  deliberations -- applied equally to the papers released. When  this contradiction was pointed out, Brussels produced a response  worthy of Sir Humphrey: the justice division (which withheld  its documents) was right, the social affairs department (which  released its documents) was wrong. It is not just the windows  which Brussels wants closed, but the shutters as well.    The root of the problem is not difficult to identify: the  vagueness of the European Union's commitment. The Maastricht  Declaration on the right of access to information could not have  been clearer: "Transparency strengthens the democratic nature  of the institutions." The code which followed has a list of  perfectly respectable exemptions (public security, monetary  stability, commercial interests), but also a catch-all exemption  worthy of a totalitarian state: the right to refuse access "in  order to protect the institution's interest in the  confidentiality of its proceedings." To their credit, the Dutch  object to this sweeping clause. The fight is only beginning.  As the European Ministers themselves declared at Maastricht:  the right to know is a fundamental way of strengthening public  confidence in Europe's institutions.</p>

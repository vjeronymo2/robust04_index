			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Foreign Editor Gerg Sheridan: "Moments of Truth"] </F>   [Text] The most important triangle of power in the world  for Australia is that between China, Japan and the United  States, the three giants of the Asia-Pacific region, in many  ways the three giants of the world. While military conflict  seems very distant, the relationship between the three has not  been worse, or more inherently unstable, for decades.    In China, a terrified Government awaits the death of the  third communist emperor, Deng Xiaoping, and the almost  inevitable and potentially destabilising power struggle to  follow, even as it presides over astonishing economic growth and  social transformation.    In Tokyo, a courageous but partly crippled Government is  beset with rising corruption allegations as it struggles to  implement economic liberalisation and political reform.    In Washington, an administration grappling with its own  spiralling scandal management problems is weak before a  protectionist and sectional Congress. President Bill Clinton,  who has constantly avowed the overwhelming priority for domestic  issues in his administration, has identified only two themes in  foreign policy of any consequence -- the use of foreign trade to  promote American jobs, and the international promotion of human  rights.    The interaction of these priorities with Japan and China  means the US now risks seriously destabilising China and its  reform program, at almost incalculable risk to Australia and  East Asia, as well as stalling the Japanese economy, corroding  the practice of free trade and undermining the global  rules-based trade system. In the end, the stakes are nothing  less than war and peace, for a China bloodied by vicious  American trade sanctions will be unpredictable at best, and if  the US persists with its unreasonable abuse of Japan, a  nationalist reaction there cannot be ruled out. Moreover, Japan  could be forced to respond to Chinese instability.    Australia must try to pick its way through a chaotic and  unpredictable clash of forces. The Keating Government has  consistently opposed America's basic policy on Japan and China,  with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Gareth Evans, sitting  calmly beside US Secretary of State Warren Christopher at their  recent joint press conference in Canberra, and saying that  threatening to withdraw most favoured nation [MFN] status from  China was neither right in principle nor effective in practice.    But there is a deeper historical process at work here. The  staggering economic growth of East Asia is challenging US global  dominance in a way the one-dimensional military challenge of the  Soviet Union never did. We are now in a pivotal phase in the  development of the triangular relationship, a time when we can  make some provisional judgments and identify some looming  moments of truth.    It is now clear, for instance, that the completion of the  Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade did  not signal a renewed American commitment to free trade.  Instead, the US will take what benefits it can get from GATT  and multilateralism, will also seek special-favour regional  deals where possible especially in the North American Free Trade  Agreement, and will increasingly use its might to bludgeon  bilateral concessions out of individual trade partners such as  Japan.    Several crisis points are near. In June, the US will have to  decide whether to renew China's MFN status. MFN is the normal  trade status afforded to virtually everybody. Not renewing it  would be a savage act, tantamount to an act of economic war.    Then in September, the provisions of the newly re-activated  Super 301 trade legislation will come into play. Super 301 will  allow the US to declare the Japanese unfair traders and take  punitive trade sanction actions against them.    MFN in June, and Super 301 in September -- the US stands  poised to take two of the most destructive, anti-free trade  actions in its history, actions which could have devastating  consequences for Australia.    How did it get to this ridiculous impasse?    With Japan, the US complaint is an old one, that Japan  discriminates against imports through invisible trade barriers  and this is why it runs a trade surplus with the US of nearly  $US60 billion ($84.17 billion). The problem is the facts do not  square with this analysis. Japan imports, per head, about the  same value of products as many affluent West European countries.  Moreover, Japan is already moving as rapidly as reasonably  imaginable towards a more import-friendly and deregulated  economy. According to a study by the East Asia Analytical Unit  of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Japan's  manufactured imports tripled between 1985 and 1991, rising to  $US113 billion, and falling very slightly the next year because  of Japan's recession. In recent years Japan's imports have  reached as high as 8 per cent of its gross domestic product,  compared with about 9.5 per cent for the US. The prospect for  continued growth in imports is good.    The real story of the second half of the 1980s was America's  declining market share in Japan. The US share of the Japanese  market for manufactured imports fell from 35 per cent in 1985 to  27 per cent in 1992. The big winners in the Japanese market in  that period were China, South Korea, South East Asia and the  European Community. A huge part of the US deficit with Japan is  thus unquestionably caused by American lack of competitiveness.    US administration figures from Clinton to Christopher, and  trade representative Mickey Kantor, say they are not trying to  impose managed trade on Japan. They want Japan's markets opened  up to all comers but they want this opening measured by  conformity with numerical targets.    But as Australia's trade minister Senator Bob McMullan  pointed out to Christopher, with all the political pressure  coming from the US obviously Japan could be pushed into  accommodating that pressure by giving special preference to the  US against other suppliers such as Australia.    The US's rough-house tactics of threatened sanctions against  Japan even led to the remarkable sight this week of the European  Union coming to Japan's defence. The European trade  commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, said the US was being  "discriminatory" in its policies towards Japan. He also raised  the question of the US's hypocrisy concerning its own vast array  of trade barriers. Brittan said Europe had "a very long list of  US trade barriers" that it wanted the US to remove. He also  said "Any attempt to force (Japanese) markets open through  numerical targets risks above all being counterproductive as  well as being incompatible with Europe and America's mutual  commitment to free trade and multilateralism." American  policy-makers should also know their actions have brought  American prestige in Asia to an all-time low. There is not a  single Asian opinion maker of consequence who considers the US's  behaviour justified. Indeed, Japan is assuming heroic status  for resisting "managed trade". Even Prime Minister Paul Keating  congratulated former Japanese prime minister Kiichi Miyazawa for  resisting US pressure for managed trade.    It is clear the completion of the Uruguay Round of GATT has  done nothing to solve the US-Japan tension. Moreover,  Australia's brave attempt to multilateralise the  Tokyo-Washington problems by putting them in an Asia-Pacific  Economic Co-operation [(APEC] context has also so far been  unsuccessful, although APEC remains immensely constructive. But  if the US is successful in its Super 301 harassment of Japan, it  will undermine many of the gains won in the Uruguay Round. The  GATT system cannot really function if the world's most powerful  economy flouts its spirit and devotes increased attention to  one-on-one deals where its huge size is most effective.    In this kind of a world, trade blocs and regional trade  associations will flourish, as smaller nations seek to combine  for protection against the US. With Australia a natural member  of no significant trade bloc, our interests would be very hard  to protect.    Even worse for us, and for the region, would be cutting off  China's MFN status if it does not make substantial improvements  in its human rights performance. China and Russia represent  opposite models of giant nations making the transition out of  communism. Russia chose democracy (glasnost) first, and economic  restructuring (perestroika) second. As a result it is a  shambles and its prospects remarkably poor. China went the  other way, opening up its economy first while delaying political  reform. As a result human freedom is increasing almost  exponentially in China. It is the fastest growing economy in  the world. In Guangzhou, in Shanghai, in Fujian, the authority  of the central Government is weakening; regional and personal  autonomy is growing.    There are two great threats -- a savage clampdown by the  central Government or the breakdown of all coherent government  authority and the emergence of chaos on a big scale. Removing  MFN status makes both much likelier. If economic reform fails  because of American trade sanctions the Chinese Government will  have a chance of re-establishing legitimacy on the basis of  fervid nationalism and anti-Americanism which most Chinese in  such circumstances may well share.    Evans drew Christopher's attention to the damage that would  be done to Hong Kong's economy by revoking China's MFN status.  Similarly, Taiwan and other regional economies would suffer. At  worst, the region could be dealing with millions of Chinese  refugees because of American trade sanctions against China.    China today is at a unique moment in its history. For the  first time tens, perhaps hundreds, of millions of Chinese have a  chance of escaping from the poverty and tyranny which has  normally been their lot and making a transition into a modern  economy (which would eventually produce a modern polity).  Allegedly in the interests of human rights, Washington is  prepared to jeopardise all that.    As Richard Solomon, the US assistant secretary of State for  East Asia under George Bush said this week on US television:  "Its illogical. Why? Because I think there's a general  realisation there has been really dramatic improvement in the  situation in China if one takes a 10 or 20-year perspective.  Economic growth and the trade that's been a driving force  behind that has been a real force for positive improvement. To  threaten to pull MFN is to undercut one of our major sources of  positive influence for improving the situation in China."    China has always resented being pushed around by the West.  During Christopher's visit, its leaders made absolutely clear  they will make no significant concessions to the US to secure  MFN status. But if Clinton backs down on his MFN threat, he will  look to a domestic US audience like a hypocrite and a wimp. As  Solomon comments: "The administration has boxed itself in."  Either Clinton will maintain his credibility domestically and  cause havoc in China and East Asia, or he will give in.    The world may be very badly served by having a Democrat  Congress and a Democrat President. Reagan and Bush governed in  spite of Congress. As a result they were not afraid of taking  Congress on, which is essential in foreign policy. Congress  could have passed resolutions cancelling China's MFN status  every day of the week and twice on Sundays and Bush would have  vetoed every one.    But Clinton needs Congress. East Asia could easily be thrown  into chaos in order to salvage the Clinton health plan, such are  the complexities, and the absurdities, of the trade-offs between  the Congress and the White House.    The final irony is that the success of both China and Japan  is a consequence of earlier farsighted American foreign policy  -- its benign administration of Japan after World War II and  Richard Nixon's brilliant innovation in bringing China into the  wider world in the 70s. But the quality of American leadership  in those days was very different from today. While there is  some indication that senior administration figures understand  the extreme danger of their current Asian brinkmanship, and  while fortunately no military rivalry is as yet involved, a  stable relationship between the three giants of the Asia-Pacific  looks a distant prospect.</p>

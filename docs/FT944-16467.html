			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Red card for rules on TV sport Government restrictions which prevent Wimbledon, the FA Cup and other big British sporting events being shown on a pay-per-view basis on UK television should be scrapped, a discussion paper argues today. In the current edition of Consumer Policy Review* Philip Cullum, manager of policy research at the Association of Consumer Research, says the 'listed events' rules introduced under the 1990 Broadcasting Act 'work against the interests of consumers'. They do not, for example, require consultation with consumer groups on content of the list or grant consumers rights to see events on television. Instead they protect established broadcasters against satellite and cable company competition. Cullum says that by handing exclusive rights to terrestrial broadcasters - instead of simply removing exclusivity from the reach of pay-per-view channels - the rule could deprive viewers of innovative new services. He also argues that the system is anomalous - if Scotland played England at football in the 1996 European Championship final 'the game might be shown on a pay-per-view basis, but if Lithuania meets Liechtenstein in the next World Cup finals the match could not be shown on a pay-per-view basis'. At present satellite broadcasters like BSkyB, in which the Financial Times' parent Pearson owns a stake, only offer subscription channels. The House of Commons Heritage Select Committee, however, has recommended the relevant section of the 1990 Act be extended to such channels. Cullum says it may be appropriate to regulate televised sport in other ways. He thinks BSkyB's charges should be closely monitored by the Office of Fair Trading. *Published by the Consumer's Association.</p>

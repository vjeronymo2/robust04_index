			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Autonomy urged for Hungarians living in Slovakia HUNGARY has called for autonomy for ethnic Hungarians living in neighbouring Slovakia and said that the common border would need to be reconfirmed if Czechoslovakia splits. The calls came as proposals to limit the use of the Hungarian language in Slovakia have given edge to fears in Hungary about intolerant Slovak nationalism. Budapest is particularly sensitive to events in Czecholovakia because it is the third of Hungary's multinational neighbours to have disintegrated leaving large Hungarian minorities under leftist- nationalist rule. Mr Geza Jeszenszky, Hungary's foreign minister, said he favoured a settlement for the 600,000-strong Hungarian minority in Slovakia on the model of the German-speaking South Tyrol region of Italy. Dismissing nervousness about the proposal, he said autonomy was a basic requirement of democracy. Budapest is exerting subtle pressure on its neighbours for concessions on autonomy by implicitly linking the rights of ethnic Hungarian minorities to recognition of the border lines which left them outside Hungary. Hungary maintains that the country's borders with both Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia are defined in relation to the united federations and would need technically to be reconfirmed with separatist states. At the same time Hungary wants what it calls 'transparent borders' so that the question of minorities loses its relevance. Mr Jeszenszky justified the linkage of the security of minorities and borders, saying: 'The real solution (for fixed borders) is to make minorities happy and content.' Although the Budapest government has consistently denied any territorial claims, its statements introduce an element of doubt about the frontiers and reawaken memories in neighbouring countries of Hungary's occupation of the Hungarian-speaking parts of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Romania during the second world war.</p>

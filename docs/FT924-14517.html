			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Move to end power plant walkout UNION officials will meet shop stewards this morning in an attempt to resolve an unofficial walkout by more than 2,000 workers that has halted construction of the Enron gas-fired power plant, Teeside, Chris Tighe writes. The workers - employed by the main contractor, Wimpey, and nearly 20 subcontractors - walked out on Monday in a protest over safety standards. Enron Power Corporation said the safety issues had been addressed but the men refused to return until Monday unless they received full payment for the hours they had lost. The company had offered 10 hours money a man. Enron has warned that the men are in breach of agreements and are risking dismissal. Teesside officials of the main unions involved will today urge the men to return to work immediately. Construction of the plant, at Imperial Chemical Industries' Wilton site, began nearly two years ago and is due to finish in January.</p>

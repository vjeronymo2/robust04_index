			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Softer Patten line lifts HK share index HONG KONG Governor Chris Patten's change of tactics in agreeing to discuss separately some minor elements of his political reform proposals were interpreted by investors yesterday as a political breakthrough. The stock market rose to its highest ever, on record turnover. In his statements, however, Mr Patten was adamant that a separate agreement over some 'straightforward' issues would not affect the timetable for his more contentious proposals on the 1995 elections of the Legislative Council, Hong Kong's law-making body. He said: 'It is the Legislative Council elections which impose the real time pressures and, to that extent, argument about the district boards is slightly irrelevant.' Some media commentators said Mr Patten's comments represented a concession to China, which has pushed for separate discussions over district board and municipal elections from those for Legco. The district elections are to be held in 1994, and, by focusing on these, the Chinese would hope to buy time on the blueprint for the subsequent Legco elections, which it strongly opposes. These suggestions of a conciliatory move provided further fuel for the colony's red-hot stock market, and the Hang Seng Index rose 351 points, or 4 per cent, to 8,764. The index has risen almost 1,100 points since the start of October. Many analysts believe Mr Patten's move will at least enable British and Chinese negotiators to resume a dialogue in the next round of talks on October 20, following several meetings which have yielded little more than recriminations over lack of progress. By moving from his stated position that 'the proposals need to be considered as a package', he has made a concession which could facilitate an agreement on several minor issues, such as the reduction of the voting age from 21 to 18. But there is still no evidence China is prepared to alter its position on the more important elements of his proposals. Mr Patten will meet the British cabinet on November 10th to discuss whether to proceed with the negotiations with China, or to table the proposals before Legco.</p>

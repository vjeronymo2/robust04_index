			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> POINT MUGU'S PLAN TO CLEAR AIR LEAVES SOME SMOKERS IN A HUFF  </P> <P> Beginning April 1, the Pacific Missile Test Center at Point Mugu will implement  a smoking ban in most indoor areas at the base -- a prospect that has some  employees fuming.  </P> <P> "I respect other people's wishes, and I am considerate of nonsmokers," said  Sheila Lloyd, a civilian resource assistant at Point Mugu. "But I think some of  this is going too far."  </P> <P> Lloyd, 51, said that rather than force people to go outside to smoke, the base  should provide designated smoking rooms so that employees can be close to their  work space and be protected from extreme weather conditions.  </P> <P> "I can see where we bother those people that don't smoke," Lloyd said. "But I  think if we take the time and the effort to cooperate so that their work area  and the air they breathe is clean, then they should at least make concessions  for us, so that we can have a place to go other than outside. It's just like  being treated like a leper."  </P> <P> A survey conducted last year of 5,000 civilian and U.S. Navy personnel at the  base, including Rear Adm. George H. Strohsahl, a nonsmoker, showed overwhelming  support for the ban, said Bob Hubbard, a Point Mugu spokesman. The base employs  about 9,000 people.  </P> <P> Hubbard said a committee was formed in August to look into the possibility of  implementing a ban after a number of supervisors reported complaints about  smokers.  </P> <P> "We have to consider the health of others," Hubbard said. "If one employee  says, 'I can't work because of smoke,' that employee has to be accommodated."  </P> <P> Many areas at the base -- including sophisticated computer and engineering labs  as well as restaurants and clubs -- have long had smoking restrictions in  place, Hubbard said.  </P> <P> Under the ban, smoking will only be permitted in living quarters and designated  smoking areas in restaurants and clubs, Hubbard said.  </P> <P> "What you do on your own time is your business," Hubbard said. "What you do  that affects others in an office environment is our business."  </P> <P> Although reactions about the ban have been mixed, Marge Hays is one civilian  employee at the base who is overjoyed with the new policy.  </P> <P> "I love it," said Hays, who suffers from chronic sinus problems that are  compounded by cigarette smoke. "I was just relieved to see it happen."  </P> <P> The 32-year-old office clerk said she previously served at air stations in  Alaska and Washington where smoking was not permitted and "just assumed" that  there was a similar policy in place when she arrived at Point Mugu in August.  </P> <P> "I don't think I ever considered how important it was until I came here," said  Hays, who had to share her office with a smoker.  </P> <P> After enduring months of headaches, a runny nose and sore throats, she finally  complained to her supervisor and the smoking stopped. Her colleague now goes  outside when she wants to light up.  </P> <P> The smoking restriction put a strain on her relationship with her co-worker,  Hays said, but she had no choice but to complain.  </P> <P> "My basic theory was that her cigarette smoke made me sick," Hays said, "and  I'm using my sick leave in support of her habit."  </P> <P> Many Point Mugu smokers interviewed recently empathized with nonsmokers, such  as Hays, and said they supported the ban.  </P> <P> "I think it's a good idea," said Bradley Oberg, a 23-year-old sailor. "I don't  think it's fair to make other people breathe your secondhand smoke."  </P> <P> "It's a nasty, dirty habit," said Oberg, who has been smoking since he was  about 13. "If you want to do something that has obviously been proven to be bad  for you, I don't think it should be promoted. I think it should be  discouraged."  </P> <P> Lloyd, who has been smoking for 30 years, said she has tried many times to quit  smoking.  </P> <P> "I'll quit and go for two months, and I'll say I can't take it anymore," Lloyd  said. "It's a crutch, but it makes me feel better to know that that cigarette  is burning. For a nonsmoker, it's hard . . . they just can't understand."  </P> <P> Lloyd said the ban will be hard on some of her colleagues as well, particularly  one man who likes to smoke in his office.  </P> <P> "He'll probably be climbing the walls or move his desk outside," she said,  laughing.  </P> <P> For those who see the ban as an opportunity to quit smoking altogether, there  is help.  </P> <P> Anti-smoking clinics are held on the base every three months, with the next  scheduled April 3, said Dave Talley, one of three clinic instructors.  </P> <P> "We've been getting a lot of calls from people wanting to get in the clinics  since word has spread about the ban," Talley said.  </P> <P> About 70% to 80% of the people who attend the classes, held during lunch break,  are able to quit, Talley said.  </P></p>

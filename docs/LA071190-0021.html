			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> EMERSON QUARTET OPENS FORD SEASON  </P> <P> To open what has become one of our most civilized and welcome summer rituals,  Chamber Music at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre, the Emerson String Quartet  on Monday offered a cohesive but risk-filled program of works by Mozart,  Shostakovich and Schumann.  </P> <P> The risks had to do with how much introversion the outdoor venue would tolerate  and project, what with the omnipresent freeway noise, the rowdy blue jays, the  helicopter overflights.  </P> <P> Well, the breezes that can waft the song of the big rigs right into your ears  were flowing in the opposite direction, and the jays ceased their squabbling  with the first Mozartean downbeat (the sunset helped, too). The helicopters,  alas, visited on no fewer than five occasions.  </P> <P> The Emersons -- violinists Eugene Drucker and Philip Setzer, violist Lawrence  Dutton, cellist David Finckel -- proved equal to all comers, playing with their  characteristic purposefulness, expertise and, on this occasion, dramatic punch.  The often weepy, close-to-the-vest Mozart Quartet in D Minor, K. 421, was  delivered with uncommon speed (the first movement for once taken at the allegro  clip demanded) and rhythmic tension.  </P> <P> Shostakovich's relatively genial, underemphatic Ninth Quartet -- note how this  composer has come to occupy what used to be the Bartok spot on the program --  might seem an equally chancy work for the outdoors, but not in the Emerson's  grippingly taut, impeccably detailed and, finally, theatrical reading.  </P> <P> Schumann's A-minor Quartet is the sort of extrovert material ideally suited to  the surroundings, but here, ironically, there were problems.  </P> <P> The moonstruck adagio was taken at a pace sufficiently slow to approach  inertness, while the finale was such a headlong dash that its innate friskiness  was trampled in the rush to the finish -- a remarkably clean-textured finish,  nonetheless.  </P> <P> Bartok appeared at encore time: the pizzicato movement of his Fourth Quartet,  played with wit and relish.HERBERT GLASS  </P></p>

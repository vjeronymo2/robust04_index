			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH PRESSES IRAN ABOUT U.S. HOSTAGES  </P> <P> President Bush on Monday called upon the Iranian government, in the wake of the  death of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, to work for the release of American  hostages held by Muslim extremists in Lebanon if it wishes to improve relations  with the United States.  </P> <P> He also said U.S. experts are still uncertain about political developments in  Tehran after Khomeini's death.  </P> <P> Iran's president, Ali Khamenei, was named Khomeini's successor as the nation's  spiritual leader. "But in a society of that nature," Bush noted, "it's hard to  predict" what will happen.  </P> <P> Asked at a news conference if he planned any other kind of overture to Tehran  to improve relations, the President said:  </P> <P> "No, absolutely not. They know what they need to do. They have been a terrorist  state, and as soon as we see some move away from oppression and extremism of  that nature, we will review our relationship."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Outlined at Inaugural  </P> <P> Bush noted that he outlined the conditions for improved relations in his  inaugural address Jan. 20.  </P> <P> At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler emphasized those  conditions.  </P> <P> "The Iranian government will have to decide whether it wants to take the steps  which are required for an improvement in relations," she said.  </P> <P> "I will restate them. It should use its considerable influence over the hostage  holders in Lebanon to bring about immediately the safe and unconditional  release of all hostages. If Iran wants to be a responsible member of the  international community, it should also stop its support of international  terrorism and terrorists," Tutwiler said.  </P> <P> Sixteen Westerners, including nine Americans, are being held in Lebanon by  Islamic fundamentalists who are widely believed to receive aid from Tehran.  </P> <P> Reflecting the continuing hostility between the United States and Iran, no  message of condolence has been sent about Khomeini's death, Tutwiler indicated,  and no U.S. representative will attend the funeral.  </P> <P> "I'm not sure we were invited," she said.  </P></p>

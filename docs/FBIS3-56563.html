Concerning this,  Stanislav Shushkevich, head of the Belarusian Parliament,  expressed to INTERFAX the supposition that Gaydar had not been  presented with an analysis of Belarus's expenditure on  elimination of the aftermath of the Chernobyl accident, on which  the republic annually spends 15 percent of its annual budget.

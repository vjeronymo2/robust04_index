			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> USD MOVES UP TO NEXT WCC STEP  </P> <P> Pat Holbert began this season as a second-string guard for the University of  San Diego. He's finishing it a star.  </P> <P> Holbert, who matched his career high of 27 points, made a seldom seen  four-point play late to give USD an 80-74 victory over San Francisco Saturday  night in a first-round West Coast Conference tournament game at Loyola  Marymount's Gersten Pavilion.  </P> <P> USD's victory, its first conference tournament victory in three years, means  the Toreros will play Pepperdine in the semifinals here tonight at 7. USF,  which has yet to win a tournament game in the four years of its existence,  finished a terribly disappointing season 8-20. The Dons lost eight of their  last nine games.  </P> <P> USD, which began the year 3-7, has won nine of 11 and 13 of 18 since late  December. It improved to 16-12.  </P> <P> With USD holding a tenuous 67-65 lead with two minutes 38 seconds left, Holbert  took a pass out on USD's right wing and went up for a three-point shot. It went  down -- his fifth of the game to do so -- and Holbert went to the line as not  even Scott McWhorter could stop him with a foul. Holbert, the WCC's fourth-best  free-throw shooter at 84%, made the free throw giving USD a 71-65 lead.  </P> <P> Shawn Sykes (20 points) made his third three-pointer 20 seconds later as the  Dons pulled within three, but USD made four of five and six of seven free  throws down the stretch to ice it.  </P> <P> "Last year we would execute our offense awfully well and then teams would  decide to double down low and we couldn't really hit the outside shot," Egan  said. "Pat has added that dimension. He's a very good shooter."  </P> <P> USD had things going its way early. It used a 11-2 run to pull ahead, 18-11,  nine minutes into the game. John Jerome made a basket and a free throw, Craig  Cottrell a driving layup and a 15-foot jumper and Holbert a layup and a  19-footer.  </P> <P> USF struggled to get any continuity going and did not have a player with more  than one basket until Sykes hit a jumper with 9:02 left. On the play, Jerome  picked up his second foul and was out the rest of the half.  </P> <P> Joel DeBortoli, an All-WCC selection and USF's leading scorer at 18.2 points  per game, did not score until 10:13 remained in the first half. He finished the  game with a team-high 23 points.  </P> <P> Keith Colvin, starting at center in place of Dondi Bell who has been slowed  with an inflamed hip, covered DeBortoli early on. Then it was Dondi Bell, who  swatted away his first shot. Dondi Bell also blocked a James Bell shot during  USD's 11-2 run.  </P> <P> With Jerome out, USF went on a 10-0 run and pulled ahead, 28-24, with 7:18  left.  </P> <P> That was when Kelvin Woods and Anthony Thomas took over. During the final seven  minutes of the half, Woods scored nine points, Thomas eight and USF seven.  </P> <P> It was Woods' driving layup with two seconds left that gave USD its 41-35  halftime lead.  </P> <P> Holbert had 13 of USD's first 24 points making five of seven shots, including  three of five three-pointers. Holbert, a transfer from Mesa (Arizona) Community  College and an All-WCC honorable mention, was USD's leading outside shooter  this season making 45% (49 of 109) from three-point range.  </P> <P> Many felt he should have been a first-team selection. "I'm really not that  worried about it. As long as we keep playing well," Holbert said. "If not this  year, maybe next year. The coaches that didn't vote for me, I hope I get the  chance to play against their team next year."  </P> <P> "Next year I'm going for MVP," he said laughing.  </P> <P> USD, which outrebounded USF in two earlier contests this season, had a 19-13  advantage in the first half and 37-30 overall.  </P> <P> USF was more aggressive after the intermission and pulled to within, 43-42, but  Cottrell scored nine of the game's next 11 points to provide some comfort for  the Toreros.  </P> <P> Among two USF free throws, Jerome made a short bank shot, Woods a pair of  baskets and Holbert a layup to give USD an 11-point lead (57-46) with 12:42  left. After DeBortoli and Jerome exchanged baskets, USF scored nine in a row  and trailed by just 59-57.  </P> <P> But Holbert answered that with a personal five-point run over the next 12  seconds making his fourth three-pointer and a flying, left-hand slam after a  steal at the top of the Dons' key.  </P> <P> WCC TOURNAMENT  </P> <P> AT LOYOLA MARYMOUNT  </P> <P> FIRST-ROUND RESULTS  </P> <P> Loyola Marymount 121, Gonzaga 84  </P> <P> Pepperdine 94, St. Mary's 83  </P> <P> Portland 65, Santa Clara 62  </P> <P> U. San Diego 80, USF 74  </P></p>

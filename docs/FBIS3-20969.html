			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by OEL: "Brightness of Light-Emitting Diodes </F> Clearly Improved; Polymer in Conjunction With Indium-Tin Oxide  Electrodes; Thin Polyphenyl Vinyl Coating"]    [Text] Frankfurt--Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are based on  the phenomenon of electroluminescence--if several electrons with  different energy levels come together, they emit photons. The  number of photons released is responsible for the luminosity of  the LEDs and that depends on the material used.    In addition to the up to now most frequently used  semiconductor materials, since 1990, with a discovery by British  physicists and chemists at the University of Cambridge, we have  also been aware of organic polymer compounds that are capable of  electroluminescence. Up to now, however, they exhibited  conversion rates of only from 0.5 to 1 percent, corresponding to  200 or 100 electrons per photon released, which is why they did  not give off enough light for practical applications.    A polymer now being used by researchers consists of  cyanoterephthalyliden, a terephthalic acid used as a substitute,  the manufacture of which is well mastered. It makes it possible  to produce LEDs with a conversion rate of up to 4 percent. This  results in a very high luminosity given the fact that ordinary  electric light bulbs attain rates of only about 10 percent.    The new polymer works in conjunction with indium-tin oxide  electrodes that are coated with a thin layer of polyphenyl  vinyls (PPV). It absorbs into its conduction band electrons that  are injected from the electrode material and the coating.    PPV was the first polymer that the team of scientists  discovered. But it exhibits a relatively high  electron-conduction band and it could only be made luminescent  with a very reactive electrode material like calcium. This is  why its practical application was not possible. But, since it  attaches itself readily to more stable indium-tin oxide  electrodes, this makes possible an effective transfer of  electrodes to the polycyanoterephthalyliden.    The developers hope to be able to produce bright displays  covering large surfaces and, later, computer monitor screens as  well with this new and, in comparison with semiconductor  materials, easier to process polymer. This is why they have  founded a new company, Cambridge Display Technology, Ltd., for  its commercial application. This company is expected to obtain  additional capital to work out the production techniques, set up  possible production, or assign licenses to interested industrial  companies. The scientists want to continue their search for  more, similar organic compounds and, in addition, attempt to  further increase the power output by improving the coating  between the electrodes and the active polymer.

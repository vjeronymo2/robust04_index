			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Bank questions NatWest loan weighting NATIONAL Westminster's sensitivities about its low capital ratio led it into disagreement with the Bank of England over the risk weighting of some of its credit facilities, it emerged yesterday. The bank was keen to avoid having to put up capital backing for some of its undrawn credit facilities, understood to include financing for English China Clays, the building materials group, and Rhone Poulenc, the French chemicals company. But it was told by the Bank of England that such undrawn facilities could not carry zero-weighting for the purposes of calculating its capital ratio. NatWest's tier one capital rose from 5.2 at the end of 1992 to 5.5 according to its interim statement for the first half of 1993. Yet this is still relatively low for a large clearing bank. The figure was only achieved by having the results reviewed by the auditors so that retained interim profit could count towards the ratio. It is the only bank with which the Bank of England has differed over the interpretation of the complicated rules on undrawn credit facilities. NatWest declined to comment. Undrawn credit facilities of up to one year carry a zero weighting. The problem arises if they are rolled forward during the year. They are only then regarded by the Bank of England as eligible for zero weighting if the lender undertakes a full credit review of the whole transaction which includes the right to cancel the facility. The Bank of England has recently relaxed these rules slightly, but it still insists on lenders obtaining a right to cancel the existing facility, unless it is rolled forward in the last 30 days of the one year period.</p>

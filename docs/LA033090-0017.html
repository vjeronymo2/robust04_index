			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;  </P> <P> APPEALS COURT RULES AGAINST DEVELOPER  </P> <P> Ojai city officials hailed what they hope is a final victory in a seven-year  legal struggle over a developer's right to build a large shopping center.  </P> <P> An appeals court upheld Ventura County Superior Court Judge Jerome Berenson's  1988 ruling on behalf of Ojai, following a trial in which more than 300 cities  and counties filed briefs on Ojai's behalf.  </P> <P> Howard Palmer of Anaheim, a partner in Ojai Investments, is reviewing his  options to petition the state Supreme Court within 40 days to hear his case,  said his attorney, John McConica of Ventura.  </P> <P> Palmer filed suit against Ojai in 1983 when he claimed the city took longer  than a year to review his project application. He lost in 1984, won on appeal  in 1986 and lost again two years ago.  </P> <P> Ojai City Atty. Monte Widders and City Councilman Jim Loebl said they are  confident the city will win, if Palmer appeals. THIA BELL  </P></p>

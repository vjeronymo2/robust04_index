			<p>BFN     [Text] The tense atmosphere that has been created in the  chain of command of the Turkish Armed Forces by President  Suleyman Demirel's opposition to the extension of the term of  office of General Dogan Gures, chief of the General Staff, is  continuing. The commanding officers of the military forces met  and assessed the situation in the General Staff headquarters  yesterday.    Considering Gen. Gures' determined opposition to the  extension of his term of office, the military forces are  convinced that Gen. Ismail Hakki Karadayi will be appointed the  new chief of the General Staff. The summit of the commanders in  Elmadag, the day before yesterday, continued in the General  Staff headquarters yesterday. Gen. Gures; Gen. Ismail Hakki  Karadayi, commander of the Grand Forces; Admiral Vural Bayazit,  commander of the Naval Forces; Gen. Halis Burhan, commander of  the Air Force; Gen. Aydin Ilter, general commander of the  Gendarmerie Forces; and Gen. Ahmet Corekci, deputy chief of the  General Staff, met at 1600 and conferred for nearly one and a  half hours.    Sources close to the General Staff have said that Gen. Gures  reiterated that his term of office will end on 30 August. The  same sources said that they discussed a way to surmount the  obstacle President Demirel has created against the extension of  the services of the commanders of the Air Force and the Naval  Forces. The term of office of the two commanders will end in  1994.</p>

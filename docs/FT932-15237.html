			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: South Africa JOHANNESBURG fell following Saturday's assassination of the Communist Party chief and ANC national executive member, Mr Chris Hani. The overall index fell 60 to 3,529, heavily influenced by golds which shed 47, or 3.7 per cent to 1,217. The industrial index closed 17 lower at 4,352. Dealers said that a major sell-off had been avoided, but that tomorrow's general stayaway, called by the African National Congress, was expected to dictate short term direction.</p>

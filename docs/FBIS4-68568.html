			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with R.B. Guliyev, chairman of the National </F> Assembly of Azerbaijan, by Anatoliy Blyudin, under the rubric  "Visits"; place and date not given: "Rasul Guliyev: We Will Not  Yield a Single Square Meter of Land"]    [Text] Rasul Guliyev, in Soviet times a prominent  functionary of the oil industry of Azerbaijan, and currently the  chairman of the National Assembly of Azerbaijan and, they say,  the second most important person next to Aliyev in Baku, will be  arriving in Moscow today on an official working visit.    Rasul Guliyev has given an interview to NOVAYA  YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA.    [Blyudin] Rasul Bayramovich, what is your attitude toward  the  present-day problems of the CIS? In general, do you believe in  the viability of this union?    [Guliyev] This is not the first case in history of an empire  falling apart. The same thing happened in Italy, England, and  other countries. Indeed, this process is proceeding very  painfully here, and there are many reasons for this: Some of the  new states are still young, and do not have adequate experience  in statehood. Strong mutual mistrust is the second factor. Let  us not dwell on explaining the reasons for this mistrust; let us  acknowledge that it exists. Well, the third factor--it seems to  me that there are still many people who would like to return to  the past--a single Union, centralization, etc., once again. A  general economic crisis is, to my mind, the main reason for  difficulties in the CIS. In the Union, the economy was  completely subordinated to political interests. Important  economic decisions were made not only without any serious  scientific analysis but also contrary to common sense. We are  now having to pay for this.    We must reconcile ourselves to this because there is no  other  way to a better life. History indicates that time passes, wounds  caused by the disintegration of empires heal, and life returns  to normal. Look at India, it now has normal economic relations  with England. The old enmity has been forgotten. We should now  have courage to admit that we will be drawing closer to one  another for a long time to come and with difficulty and, well,  also to believe that this will happen anyway.    [Blyudin] Numerous facts have been reported in our newspaper  which testify to the anti-Russian sentiment in Baku: Russians  are being evicted from their apartments, they are leaving the  republic. What is your attitude toward this?    [Guliyev] Yes, the Russian-speaking population emigrated  from  Azerbaijan during the reign of the People's Front. However, the  situation has changed since Geydar Aliyev was elected president.  We see that people are already coming back.    There are about 200,000 Russians in our country; some of  them  have lived here for more than 200 years. Our parliament will  pass laws that will securely protect their interests. Nobody  asks you in America what your ethnic background is; everybody is  American there. We should build approximately the same relations  in Azerbaijan. The idea of mononationalist politics is a dead  end. We want the Russian-speaking population to feel that  Azerbaijan is their motherland.    I am convinced that the parliament will pass the necessary  legislative acts as soon as the first half of the year.    [Blyudin] What role do you assign to Russia in stopping the  Armenian-Azerbaijan war?    [Guliyev] Of course, we believe that the Russian state will  assist in solving all the problems that have accumulated in our  region in recent years. I am convinced that Russia has such an  opportunity; both its political and economic resources are  sufficiently powerful. International organizations could take  part in these issues, shall we say, arithmetically, to the tune  of 20 percent.    We understand that complex and contradictory processes are  underway within Russia. However, we see that the above  notwithstanding, the real political forces are striving to solve  the problems peacefully. Nonetheless, political stabilization is  underway in Russia, and I attach great hopes to the growth of  the role of Russia in the peacemaking process along with this.    [Blyudin] What are the objectives of your visit to Moscow?    [Guliyev] First of all, I would like to become better  acquainted with my colleagues in Russia and share our views on  our common problems, learn where we are close to each other and  what we differ on: We must simply know each other before  anything is resolved. I would very much like a regular  businesslike relationship to develop between our parliaments.    Strong economic relations have historically evolved between  us. This is why borders between Russia and Azerbaijan should not  exist as far as investment and the economy are concerned.  Naturally, the laws our parliaments pass should promote rather  than hamper the processes of integration.    Russia is our big neighbor; we want to open all borders for  the economies. There will be no barriers to Russian investment,  but Russia should not throw up barriers to Azerbaijani  investments, either. We are in favor of civilized relations.    I worked for 12 years as the director of an oil refinery. At  that time we reported to a Union ministry; I know many Russian  oilmen well and have many friends in Russia. I come to Moscow  with great hopes because I believe in the power of common sense;  I believe that if there is enough will, a compromise may be  reached on any difficult issue.    Naturally, discussing the issue of stopping the war is also  an objective of my visit. Neither the Azeri nor the Armenian  people need this war. People are dying on both sides. I think  that everybody has ascertained this: We will not yield a single  square meter of our land. This should be understandable. If they  try to compel us to make a certain decision by forcible methods,  this means that we will fight. However, I would like to say  again that the war is not needed. Political decisions are needed.</p>

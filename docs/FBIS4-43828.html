			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by special correspondent in Birmingham Jean-Francois </F> Polo: "Declining French Electricity Requirements -- French  Electricity Company Will Order No Nuclear Plant in Next Five  Years"]    [Excerpts] The French nuclear energy program has just  suffered a setback. Aware of the low increase in electricity  demand in mainland France as well as the high productivity rate  of its power plants, EDF [French Electricity Company] will place  no new order for nuclear reactors for at least five years, CEO  Francois Ailleret announced in Birmingham on the occasion of the  23d UNIPEDE congress, which brings together Europe's major  electricity companies.    It is the first time that such a long suspension has been  decided since France launched its large-scale nuclear program 20  years ago. This decision may cause problems for boiler  manufacturer Framatome, which had been hoping for an order from  EDF by 1997 and which will have to make do with maintenance work  to maintain its know-how.    The nuclear industry is not the only one hit by the slower  growth in power requirements. According to EDF, which reviewed  the matter at its board meeting last Friday [17 June], there is  "no need to order any new power generation equipment, whether  nuclear or not, before the end of the decade, except for Corsica  and overseas territories."    Scheduled to invest 38.9 billion francs [Fr] this year,  including Fr7.5 billion for nuclear power generation, Fr.7.5  billion for power transmission, and Fr16.1 billion for power  distribution, EDF has decided to order only two gas turbines  instead of a an anticipated six. As for power export levels  (currently at 63 billion kilowatt-hour [kWh]), they are expected  to increase only slightly, to 70 billion kWh, within 10 years.  [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, EDF's CEO indicated that the public utility is  ready to pay "a significant amount" to fund the closure of the  Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine. According to Mr. Ailleret,  "the odds are better than ever" that reactor number one will be  shut down by this winter, with the rest of the plant being shut  down within two or three years, when construction currently  under way has been completed. The reported cost of the closure  program is about Fr10 billion.</p>

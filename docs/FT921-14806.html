			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Telecom Australia in Vietnam phone deal TELECOM Australia (International) has signed a joint-venture agreement with Vietnam to develop and operate a national mobile telephone service. The project's cost and the terms of the agreement are undisclosed, but it is believed that Telecom is providing finance for the equipment and management training, while the Vietnam Directorate General of Posts and Telecommunications is providing local premises and customer access. Mr Ken Loughnan, Telecom International's managing director, said construction of mobile-based stations would start in April. He said that the joint venture would initially provide an analogue mobile system in Hanoi and Ho Chi Min City. It would then expand services to other regional centres and gradually introduce digital services over the next two years. Mr Loughnan said that in the medium term, returns on the service could match those in Thailand, which has roughly the same population as Vietnam, and where mobile telephone services turn in about ADollars 200m (Pounds 81.6m) annually. Telecom's new investment puts Australia ahead of its European competitors in the race to modernise Vietnam's telecommunications. The project complements the international satellite system being operated by OTC, Australia's international carrier.</p>

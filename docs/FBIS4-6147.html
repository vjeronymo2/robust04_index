			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 19 April Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries  [MAFF] announced that it will lift the ban on imports of apples  from the United States currently in force under the Plant  Quarantine Law. The reason is that all technical issues have  been resolved through pest control and disinfectant inspections.  After public hearings are held with the concerned parties, the  import ban may be lifted as early as this autumn.    After the ban is lifted, tens of thousand tons of apples,  which are cheaper than Japanese-produced ones, may enter the  market each year, and Japanese farmers will be forced to compete.    In connection with apple imports, the United States is  strongly critical of the closed nature of the Japanese market.  This issue was included in the list of foreign trade barriers  published in late March and has been a political issue between  Japan and the United States.    In view of the continuous Japanese refusal to allow the  import of U.S. apples, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor  and Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy last year sent several  letters to the Japanese Government asking for an early lifting  of the import ban. Certain quarters in the United States have  even demanded the imposition of sanctions under Section 301 of  the Omnibus Trade Act (on sanctions against unfair trade  practices). In response to the U.S. demand, Japan has asserted:  "The possibility of new pests being brought into Japan exists.  We cannot permit the ban on imports to be lifted without  quarantine procedures being enacted."    With regard to the remaining problem of fire blight,  coddling  moths, and other pests and diseases found on U.S. apples, the  United States provided all the required extermination data last  year. The MAFF has concluded that "we found no problems with  the data." It has sent inspectors to the United States for  on-the-spot inspections and is now in the process of a final  verification.    The inspection involves a check on the pest-control  procedures in the United States. A senior MAFF official says  that "unless we find something really serious, there seems to be  no reason to deny imports." The MAFF is scheduled to finish all  public hearings for local apple farmers, academicians, and other  concerned parties by the summer. After this, the formal  decision on lifting the ban will be made. The ministry plans to  finish all the required domestic procedures before the harvest  season starts in the United States in September.</p>

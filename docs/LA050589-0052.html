			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL GUARD TO AID CUSTOMS IN WAR ON DRUGS AT PORTS  </P> <P> Nearly 300 California National Guard members will join U. S. Customs Service  inspectors at the Ports of San Diego, Los Angeles and Long Beach starting this  weekend in a stepped-up program to find narcotics being smuggled into the  country on foreign ships, guard officials announced Thursday.  </P> <P> Although the soldiers will assist custom inspectors in searching containers and  other cargo, they will not be armed and will have no authority to make arrests.  The program is slated to last four weeks and will be financed by a $1-million  federal grant, part of $40 million allocated by Congress for drug interdiction  by the National Guard.  </P> <P> California National Guard Maj. Steve Mensik said during a press conference at  the Armed Forces Reserve Center at Los Alamitos that an estimated 30% of all  illegal drugs smuggled into the country arrive in containerized cargo. The  adjacent Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are two of the largest on the West  Coast. Combined, they are the busiest in the nation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Trained to Spot Drugs  </P> <P> Guard members from throughout the state who volunteer for the anti-drug  program, Mensik said, will be given a four-hour course on how to spot illegal  drugs. The duty will last for two weeks, and soldiers will come from as far  north as Mt. Shasta and as far south as San Diego. All of them will be  processed and receive their training at the National Guard facilities at Los  Alamitos.  </P> <P> "Any discoveries of illegal drugs will be reported to custom officials who will  decide on the appropriate action to take," Mensik said. "We will be supporting  customs only."  </P> <P> Although there is virtually no chance that the Guard members would come in  contact with smugglers or drug dealers in this program, Mensik still described  the Guard role as "low-intensity combat." But he said the program would be  confined to the seaports and no Guard member would be crossing the border into  Mexico or riding in helicopters patrolling the border.  </P> <P> Mensik said no particular country or its ships have been targeted for search.  "Drugs come in from all countries, Europe and South America," he said, adding  that the program will last four weeks because that will cover the ships that  were already at sea and bound for the United States before the program was  announced to the public.  </P> <P> The cargo inspection program is not the first time the Guard has been involved  in drug interdiction, Mensik said. As far back as 1983, the Guard supplied  helicopters and crews to the state in its search for marijuana fields in  Northern California.  </P> <P> More recently, Guard helicopters and crews were used by law enforcement in a  long-term surveillance in Southern California.  </P> <P> The idea to use National Guard troops to deter drug trafficking was first  proposed in 1986 by Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Coronado). Although some officials  condemned the plan as extreme and dangerous, a bill later sponsored by Hunter  led to the use of military planes to help the Border Patrol detect illegal  border crossings by aircraft.  </P></p>

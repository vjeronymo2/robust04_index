			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / International Company News: Hawker Siddeley Canada in loss Hawker Siddeley Canada, now independent from BTR, the UK industrial conglomerate, posted a second-quarter loss of CDollars 9.2m (USDollars 6.66m), or CDollars 1.15 a share, because of continuing problems and special charges at its restructured saw mill equipment unit. The loss compared with a profit of CDollars 5.5m, or 65 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales were CDollars 81m, against CDollars 88m. The latest figures brought the first-half deficit amounted to CDollars 12.1m, or CDollars 1.53, compared with profits of CDollars 8.6m, or CDollars 1, last year, on sales of CDollars 159m against CDollars 173m. BTR sold its 59 per cent stake in the company earlier this year. Hawker Canada is now concentrating on its profitable railcar leasing business, jet engine overhaul and mining and sawmill machinery. Mr Keith Moore, president, said costs at the saw mill equipment unit were coming under control and sales prospects were improving. However, some other markets declined in the first half, including mining equipment in the UK and military engine overhaul in Canada. The foundry unit improved volume but was still unprofitable. Hawker would show a loss for 1994, said Mr Moore, but 'we're well on the way to repositioning the company for the long term'.</p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: Bank of Ireland sells stake in Greencore THE BANK of Ireland, one of the Republic's two leading clearing banks, has sold its stake in Greencore only months after the Irish government had difficulty in placing its holding. Greencore's stockbrokers, Natwest Securities and NCB stockbrokers, sold the bank's 9.6m shares in the sugar, milling and malting group at 300p apiece, making it a IPounds 2.4m (Pounds 2.25m) profit. The bank acquired the shares in May when Davy Stockbrokers had difficulty in placing the government's 30.4 per cent stake in Greencore. It rescued the sale of the government's holding by stepping in and buying the 11.6 per cent holding at 275p a share. Davy is a subsidiary of the bank. Mr Kevin O'Sullivan, Greencore's finance director, said: 'This shows there is no problem with the company or in placing its shares. Any problems in the past must have been with the government or its brokers.' The Irish Stock Exchange responded by launching an investigation into the placing of the government's holding which has been completed but has yet to be published. The bank was originally forced to sell the shares because another of its subsidiaries, the Investment Bank of Ireland, held 15 per cent of Greencore  -the maximum allowed under the company's articles of association.</p>

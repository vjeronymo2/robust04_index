			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ROBERTS HELPS CARRY PADRES TO .500, NEARER CONTENTION  </P> <P> While the Padres appear to slowly be creeping into this phenomenon called a  pennant race, a peculiar thing is happening right before their eyes.  </P> <P> The man they keep telling themselves is nothing more than a utility player,  bringing in Chris James to take his spot in left field and Mike Pagliarulo to  boot him out of third base, refuses to go away.  </P> <P> His name is Leon Roberts. His friends call him "Bip." And it's becoming more  apparent by the day that he just may be causing a snarl in the Padres' trade  plans.  </P> <P> Starting at shortstop once again ahead of Garry Templeton, Roberts was the  catalyst behind the Padre offense Thursday in their 6-5 victory over the  Atlanta Braves.  </P> <P> Roberts, who has not been a starting shortstop since high school, reached base  four times -- two walks, a single and a double -- scored two runs, caused a  throwing error and is as responsible as anyone for the Padres' victory.  </P> <P> Sweeping the Braves for the first time at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium since  Jimmy Carter was president (Sept. 7-9, 1979), the Padres reached the .500 mark  (54-54) for the first time since June 7. They have won seven of their past nine  and are within eight games of the NL West-leading Giants.  </P> <P> Never mind that the Braves are 43-65; all of a sudden, the Padres believe that  they're back in the race.  </P> <P> "I think the last three series is the best we've played in a long, long time,"  said Padre right fielder Tony Gwynn, who went three for five with two RBIs. "At  last, we're at .500. It looked like the climb we'd never make.  </P> <P> "If we're going to make a move, this is the time."  </P> <P> And who would have figured that the Padres would be making their move with  Roberts at shortstop, leaving Templeton on the bench?  </P> <P> When Roberts pulled a rib-cage muscle in the first series after the All-Star  break against the Cubs, he was forced out of the lineup for 10 days. When he  was ready to play, he found Pagliarulo at third and went back to the bench.  </P> <P> He didn't get another shot until July 28, after Templeton suffered a strained  tendon behind his left knee. Six days later, it doesn't appear he's about to  give it up.  </P> <P> "It feels strange," Roberts said. "I keep coming here looking to see my name  with the extras, but there I am in the lineup. I've always been ready for that  chance, and now it looks like I've got one.  </P> <P> "I mean, I still don't consider myself a starting shortstop. There's a lot of  things I don't know. I need experience, and that takes time. You just don't  come out and be a Garry Templeton or Ozzie Smith."  </P> <P> Perhaps this is why the Padres have been adamant in their determination to  acquire a shortstop. With Templeton's aging knees and Roberts' inexperience,  they have spent an awful lot of hours on the telephone these past few months  looking for one.  </P> <P> The Padres in fact have had discussions right here with Braves General Manager  Bobby Cox in an attempt to work out a three-team trade with the Cubs. They've  talked about a deal that would send triple-A catcher Sandy Alomar Jr. to the  Braves for infielder Jeff Blauser and an outfielder, and in turn would send  Blauser to the Cubs for shortstop Shawon Dunston.  </P> <P> It appears unlikely that the deal could be made until the Cubs drop out of the  National League East race, but when the Cubs say the word, sources say, the  deal could be consummated.  </P> <P> That is unless the Padres suddenly change their minds. And the way Roberts is  playing -- five for 13 in this series with four runs, raising his on-base  percentage to .392 -- the Padres might be a little hesitant.  </P> <P> "I told Jack (McKeon) just today," Templeton said, "if I had a couple of years  to work with him, I think he could be one of the outstanding shortstops in this  league. All he needs is experience, and he'll be a good one. There's no doubt  in my mind that he can play."  </P> <P> Yes, this is Garry Templeton talking. The man who for the time-being has lost  his job. The man who tries to familiarize Roberts with the shortstop position,  whether it's at lunch, on the field, on the bench, in the clubhouse or back at  the team hotel at night.  </P> <P> "Who am I to complain?" Templeton said. "The guy's doing a hell of a job. If we  keep winning, he should stay right there. Why mess with a winning combination?  </P> <P> "Sometime or another, you hit one one point in your career where you've got to  help somebody out. Don Kessinger did it for me when I knew I was going to take  his place, and now I'm doing it for Bip."  </P> <P> Funny how winning spawns team unity. There was Carmelo Martinez getting two  more hits while playing for injured Chris James (hip flexor), finishing the  series five for 10 with five RBIs, and saying afterwards that if James is ready  to play today, he'll gladly step aside.  </P> <P> There was backup catcher Mark Parent going two for four with an RBI, and  starter Benito Santiago patting him on the back in the clubhouse.  </P> <P> There was Mark Grant, retiring 11 of 12 batters he faced in relief of Don  Schulze (2-0), and Mark Davis standing in the bullpen cheering for Grant to get  the final out for his first save since 1987. Instead, Grant gave up three  consecutive singles, and with the tying run on second, Davis was called upon to  face Jeff Treadway. Davis struck him out on three pitches, recording his  major-league high 28th save, extending his consecutive scoreless streak to 18  innings and feeling disappointed about doing so.  </P> <P> "We're playing like a team again," Gwynn said, "and everyone's pulling their  load. This is the first time I can say we're back in this thing, we're in the  race.  </P> <P> "If we can just keep playing like we are, and get to within five or or four  games by Sept. 1, look out."  </P> <P> Padre Notes  </P> <P> Padre pitcher Eric Show's back surgery Wednesday night, according to surgeon  Dr. Roger Thorne, "could not have gone any better." Show had the fifth disk in  the lumbar region of his back removed, along with three fragments that were  pressing against the nerves. Show is expected to be released out of Scripps  Clinic this weekend, and begin rehabilitation in 10 days. Show, who was placed  on the 60-day emergency list, should be completely recovered in eight weeks,  Thorne said.  </P></p>

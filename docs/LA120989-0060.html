			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILL PRESS' BROADCASTS  </P> <P> Why should Bill Press be required to resign his positions at Channel 7 and KABC  radio because he is publicly and actively engaged in an exploratory campaign  for public office? In fact, why should he resign once he officially becomes a  candidate? Indeed, why should he resign in the happy event he wins the  election?  </P> <P> I would urge Bill to follow through on his incisive view of civil  libertarianism by challenging state and federal laws that in any way restrict  the freedom of speech guaranteed in the Bill of Rights.  </P> <P> I'm confused in one small regard, however. Is Bruce Herschensohn, who handled  the same issue in the same manner, a civil libertarian like Bill?  </P> <P> GREG C. FAST  </P> <P> Oxnard  </P> <P>  Herschensohn, also a commentator for Channel 7 and KABC-AM, was in a similar  controversy in the 1986 campaign for the Republican nomination for the U.S.  Senate. Herschensohn resigned his posts after declaring for the office and then  returned to the jobs after losing the nomination to Ed Zschau.  </P> <P> </P></p>

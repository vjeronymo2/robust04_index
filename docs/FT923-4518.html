			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / National Power agrees to sell gas NATIONAL POWER, the electricity generator, said yesterday it had signed a deal with Bord Gais Eireann, the Irish Gas Board, to supply it with natural gas in the event of unexpected shortfalls, Neil Buckley writes. The generator is ready to supply BGE with up to 1.2m therms of gas a day at short notice in times of high demand. The five-year agreement - the first of its kind - will be in autumn next year. Gas will be supplied from National Power's portfolio of supplies using British Gas's transmission network to Moffatt, southern Scotland, from where it will be delivered through the interconnector pipeline being constructed beneath the Irish Sea. Mr John Baker, National Power's chief executive, said the value of international co-operation in energy supplies could be enhanced by increased liberalisation of energy markets. The deal is further evidence of increasing crossover between the electricity and gas sectors since the government's energy privatisation programme.</p>

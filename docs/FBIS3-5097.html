The government of the United States has decided to  reinstate the Super 301 clause through an Executive Order.  However, unilateral measures not in accordance with the dispute  settlement rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to be  established as a result of the conclusion of the Uruguay Round  are explicitly prohibited. At a time when we have essentially  agreed upon these new international trading rules, the  Government of Japan cannot keep silent its concerns over this  move to strengthen procedures enabling the United States to  initiate unilateral actions against another country in the  resolution of trade problems.    2. While it is necessary to closely watch what sort of  measures the United States will take based upon the provisions  of the reinstated Super 301 clause, the Government of Japan, in  recognition of the responsibility for the development of the  world economy that Japan and the United States, as the two  largest economies in the world, bear in striving to maintain  smooth bilateral economic relations, strongly hopes that the  Government of the United States will act in a sensible manner,  and for its part, recognizes the need for a restrained response.    3. In this regard, at a recent meeting of cabinet ministers  concerned with external issues at the ministerial conference for  economic measures, the Government of Japan reaffirmed its  intention to advance voluntary measures toward further market  opening. The Government of Japan is determined to make its  utmost efforts to strive for smooth operation of our external  relations, irrespective of the aforementioned moves in the  United States.</p>

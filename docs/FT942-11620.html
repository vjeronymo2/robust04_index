			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Menem scraps pension plan Argentina's President Carlos Menem has scrapped a controversial provision forcing the country's biggest bank, government-owned Banco de la Nacion Argentina (BNA), to offer dollar-linked pension funds. The government argued the change was needed to remove a big distortion from its pension reforms, but it has led to protests that Mr Menem is ruling by personal fiat. The provision was approved last year by Congress and the president's right to issue decrees was originally intended for use in emergencies only. On Tuesday Mr Menem decreed BNA need not provide a minimum dollar-linked return for retirement savings accounts it will administer on behalf of private savers. Argentina is just beginning to implement a private pension fund system to complement the bankrupt state pay-as-you-go system. Savers must choose between staying in the state system or picking companies to manage their individual retirement accounts. Mr Menem's Peronist government last year had to accept a Peronist demand that BNA offer dollar-linked pension schemes as the party's price for supporting pension reform. But rival pension managers complained this gave BNA an unfair advantage. However, Mr Jorge Matzkin, Peronist party leader in Congress, yesterday warned the decree was 'not the most adequate way of eliminating the guarantee. We will present a bill offering substitute guarantees better than those removed.' Pension reform will channel Dollars 200m a month into the capital markets but it has been dogged by poor organisation. The government only allowed fund managers to begin selling pension plans on Monday. They have until the end of July to sign up the 5m workers eligible for the system.</p>

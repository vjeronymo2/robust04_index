			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Christopher pledges backing for business THE US secretary of state-designate, Mr Warren Christopher, yesterday promised to give economic concerns and the promotion of US commercial interests overseas a much higher profile in his conduct of foreign policy. Economic competition, he told the Senate foreign relations committee in a confirmation hearing, was eclipsing ideological rivalry as an essential ingredient in world affairs. 'For too long, we have made economics the poor cousin of foreign policy.' He said US embassies needed more than just one commercial officer helping US companies. Equally, the former Soviet republics and the countries of eastern Europe should have greater US public and private commitment and expertise in order to facilitate their transitions into market democracies. Mr Christopher's prepared testimony, the delivery of which was delayed by opening and mostly complimentary statements by committee members, made much of the imperative to connect domestic and foreign policies. 'I have long thought the State Department needs an American desk - and I'll be sitting at that desk.' He offered no new doctrine to guide foreign policy, but spoke of three fundamental realities - pursuit of economic growth, maintenance of a strong and adaptable military, and a commitment to 'build democracy from the bottom up' around the world. The use of force overseas, he said, was 'a vexing question.' Its deployment should generally be 'discreet and careful' and the threat of its use 'credible'. The Cold War had been won by 'harnessing diplomacy and power together', he said. Mr Christopher added that the UN could not be an effective instrument unless it had full US support - and he promised that the US would pay its outstanding arrears. In his tour d'horizon, Mr Christopher also promised: Support for the reform process in Russia and other former Soviet republics and satellites, conditional on their acceptance of the principles of a market democracy. Collapse of the Russian economy 'could fatally discredit democracy'. Continued commitment to Nato while new security structures in Europe were evolving, hopefully to include eastern European nations. To do what was necessary to ensure 'a peaceful and broad transition to democracy' in China, which, he said, was economically booming but still created problems in its human rights and weapons sales policies and trade protectionism. Particular attention to Japan, with the purpose of ensuring together that regional trading blocs militating against global growth were avoided. 'Unswerving' commitment to the security of Israel and the Middle East peace process. At the end of his testimony, Mr Christopher also addressed one issue that has cast a minor cloud over his nomination: what he knew, while deputy attorney general in the late 1960s, of covert domestic surveillance by the US Army. He said he had no knowledge of the kinds of activities that emerged after he left office, he stood by his testimony to the Senate foreign relations committee in 1977, and would not tolerate such activities by his State Department.</p>

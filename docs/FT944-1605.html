			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of Sweden (11): Too much money; not enough borrowers  -Banking Two years ago Swedish banks had too little money and too many loans going sour. Today they have too much money and too few people wanting to borrow it. It is a striking recovery, if a rather lop-sided one. Healthy profits are being made again but only because there has been a sharp drop in the volume of the credit losses which crippled the sector two years ago. Underlying results have actually deteriorated because of low credit demand, narrower margins and reduced profits from bond trading. The pattern is clear from the results of two of Sweden's leading private-sector banks, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and Svenska Handelsbanken. SE Banken made a nine-month profit of SKr2.87bn, a huge improvement on SKr71m a year earlier, after credit losses shrank 44 per cent to SKr4.35bn. But the result before loan losses, after stripping out hefty capital gains, was down 17 per cent on 1993. Handelsbanken achieved a SKr3.18bn profit - a 148 per cent improvement on last year. This was because a 59 per cent drop in credit losses to SKr2.14bn offset a 19 per cent fall in underlying results. The drop in loan losses has been fuelled by Sweden's economic recovery and low short-term interest rates. As for the underlying performance, Sweden's banks are partly the victim of their own caution and partly of the general state of the Swedish economy. Having been brought to their knees two years ago by reckless lending to an overheated property sector, they are now controlling their risk exposures more carefully. At the same time, customers have shied away from taking out new loans because of weak private consumption, very high long-term real interest rates and reduced tax incentives. The problem is that the banks have never been in a better position to lend money. They have strong capital ratios after the recapitalisation programmes carried out last year and, due to high personal savings levels, deposits are accumulating all the time. This means that after being undercapitalised two years ago, they are now close to being overcapitalised. But if they are not to turn away deposits, they have to do something with their surplus liquidity. This has forced them to compete aggressively to lift market share  -hence the narrower margins  - and expand their investment portfolios at a time when the securities market has been turbulent. This strategy has had painful consequences, particularly because of this year's bond market turmoil. Bond trading profits are down sharply from last year's levels, and investment portfolios have been hit by the difference between market and purchase prices. The investment performance does not feed through directly into the profit-and-loss account - as it does in Denmark - but it does affect equity and capital cover. Results are expected to improve further next year. Credit losses should continue to fall, even though short-term interest rates are on the rise again. Loan demand should also increase, particularly because of higher investments by the country's big exporters. However, state tax increases and spending cuts to curb the country's budget deficit will again hit private consumption, curbing loan demand from the household sector. Banks are not just looking to more robust loan demand to boost their business. Services are being widened to include life insurance and more sophisticated banking products. SE Banken, for example, has bought the Diners Nordic credit card operation and set up an independent 24-hours-a-day telephone banking service. Handelsbanken has become the first Swedish bank to develop a flexible occupational pension scheme. But competition is increasing. One of Sweden's leading insurers, Skandia, has set up its own banking unit and the Post Office is offering a broader range of banking services. Competition within the Nordic region is also intensifying. Both SE Banken and Handelsbanken are building up their operations in Finland and Norway. Other Nordic banks are also planning to set up branches in Sweden. The increasing cross-border competition was the main reason that four of the region's top banks broke up a 10-year co-operation venture, Scandinavian Banking Partners, during the summer. The government has still not made any move to remove the blanket guarantee which it put on the entire banking system in late 1992 at the height of the banking crisis. There are several reasons for this. One is that credit losses, though falling, are still not back to pre-crisis levels. Handelsbanken's loan losses are still running at 1 per cent of total lending, four times the level in the late 1980s. In addition, Foreningsbanken, one of the main banks, is still not back in the black. Secondly, Swedish long-term interest rates are high, and they are likely to remain so until the markets are convinced that the government has got the state debt under control. Thirdly, the backing is supporting the banks' credit ratings. Finally, the support has helped to sort out the banking crisis debris. For example, when Securum, the state-owned entity set up to liquidate the failed loans of Nordbanken, arranged a SKr20bn refinancing in the autumn, its task was made easier by implicit backing from the Swedish state. The banking crisis cost the Swedish state about SKr65bn in cash support. Some of this will be recovered by the gradual dismantling of Securum, its sister Retriva (the 'bad bank' for Gota Bank), and the return of Nordbanken to the private sector. Nordbanken, which collapsed into state arms in 1992 as the biggest casualty of the crisis and has since been merged with Gota Bank, is due to be re-privatised some time next year. Securum's progress over the past year shows that the legacy of the crisis is likely to be much shorter than was at first expected. The unit, which has converted virtually all of its sour loans into assets, seems likely to complete its liquidation programme within 10 years, having already sold SKr9bn out of SKr51bn worth of assets. It would like to have returned at least SKr10bn to the Swedish taxpayer by the end of the process.</p>

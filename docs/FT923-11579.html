			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Bus strikers halt Athens traffic Traffic in Athens came to a standstill yesterday when striking public transport workers marched in protest against the sacking of 1,200 people by the state bus company, Reuter reports from Athens. Buses disappeared from the Greek capital and commuters who used cars or taxis were trapped in huge jams. The union representing the bus workers said its 6,000 members would continue to strike until the conservative government rescinded the sackings, aimed at cutting deficits at the heavily indebted company.</p>

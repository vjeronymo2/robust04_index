			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Vienna, April 9 (AFP) -- Austria has asked  France, Belgium and Germany to evacuate if necessary 15  Austrians living in the strife-torn Rwandan capital, Kigali, the  Foreign Ministry said Saturday [9 April].    The Austrian civilians would be flown out of the country,  where savage ethnic fighting has left at least 1,000 dead in the  last three days, along with citizens of the three other  countries, under the protection of French and Belgian troops.    Austria also has some 40 nationals serving with United  Nations peacekeeping troops deployed in Rwanda as part of a  transition scheme ahead of elections planned for next year.  [passage omitted]</p>

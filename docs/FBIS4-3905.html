			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Sun Jie (1327 2638)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 12 Mar (XINHUA) -- State Council Vice  Premier Zou Jiahua spoke at a national telephone conference on  chemical fertilizer production today, calling on leaders as well  as economic and trade commissions, chemical industrial  departments, and other relevant departments at all levels to  take immediate action to promote the production, transportation,  and supply of chemical fertilizers to ensure demand in the  agricultural sector.    He said: The party Central Committee and State Council have  decided that a bumper agricultural harvest is the major task for  achieving economic and national stability this year. China's  agriculture, grain production in particular, is by no means a  local issue, but a cardinal issue having a bearing on the  overall situation; it is not an economic issue in general, but  an economic as well as political issue of strategic importance.  Therefore, it is necessary to unify thinking, take concerted  action, and make a determined effort to develop and support  agriculture. At present, the shortage of chemical fertilizers  remains acute. Farm work is seasonal, so racing against time to  produce and supply more chemical fertilizers to ensure demand  has become an urgent task in production, as well as an important  matter having a bearing on this year's harvest.    He said: Chemical industrial departments and chemical  fertilizer enterprises should strengthen confidence to overcome  difficulties and go full steam ahead to produce more chemical  fertilizers. Despite a good momentum in chemical fertilizer  production and marketing since the beginning of this year, the  supply of chemical fertilizers has fallen short of demand.  Therefore, chemical industrial departments and chemical  fertilizer enterprises should summarize experiences, and master  and keep abreast of the law governing demand to guide production  and supply. Meanwhile, operation of the nearly 600 enterprises  whose production has been suspended should resume, and  enterprises not operating at full capacity should put into high  gear to produce more chemical fertilizers. Major enterprises  that are tasked with the production of chemical fertilizers  under unified state distribution should make a determined effort  to fulfill and strive to overfulfill the task. Although chemical  fertilizer enterprises are facing difficulties and problems in  production, the shortage of market supply has provided  enterprises with a good opportunity. Hence, all productive  enterprises must strengthen confidence and exert every muscle to  overcome difficulties and create production conditions. All  enterprises must strengthen management, strive to improve  quality and lower consumption and production costs, and mobilize  workers to launch campaigns to increase production and practice  economy, and to stop deficits and increase revenue. Chemical  industrial departments and chemical fertilizer enterprises  should do everything they can to mobilize and rely on cadres and  workers to fulfill this year's production and marketing plans.  They should take strong measures to strictly control and  stabilize chemical fertilizer prices to satisfy the needs of  agricultural production and farmers.    In his speech, Zou Jiahua also urged governments at all  levels and all relevant departments to take the initiative to  create a favorable external environment for chemical fertilizer  production. He said: In order to win a bumper agricultural  harvest this year, we must ensure the delivery of quality  chemical fertilizers in full amounts to farmers. To this end,  relevant government departments should take immediate action to  comply with this requirement, taking the initiative to create a  favorable external environment for chemical fertilizer  production and to help enterprises solve problems caused by  external factors. Energy, railways, transportation, commerce,  and banking departments should coordinate efforts to help  enterprises overcome difficulties in energy, transportation,  and, in particular, funds. Industrial and commercial banks  should expedite the processing of funds approved by the State  Council meeting for storing chemical fertilizers and pesticides  in winter and for resuming the operation of small chemical  fertilizer enterprises. Departments concerned should ensure  priority supply of coal, electricity, natural gas, and heavy oil  needed for production. Railways and transportation departments  should prioritize the delivery of chemical fertilizers and their  raw materials for production. To support the production of  chemical fertilizer, the state has decided to continue the  present preferential fare for transporting chemical fertilizers  and preferential charges for electricity used by small and  medium chemical fertilizer plants in their production. All  provincial, municipal, and autonomous regional governments  should actively support chemical fertilizer enterprises in terms  of funds, raw and semi-finished materials, electricity supply,  and transportation, continuing to implement the provisions of  relevant State Council documents, adopting preferential measures  in prices, taxes, and loans, and helping enterprises solve  production problems.    He emphasized: All localities should earnestly implement the  policy toward prices of agricultural capital goods and guard  against big fluctuations in market prices. Commodity price  departments should strengthen supervision and inspection,  resolutely checking unauthorized price rises and duly punishing  indiscriminate price hikes in violation of the price policy.    He said: At present, departments in charge of agricultural  capital goods should lose no time in trying every possible way  to find new sources of goods, to link production with  transportation and marketing, and to ensure timely supply of  chemical fertilizers. They should serve as the main channels for  not only procuring and supplying chemical fertilizers and  pesticides during the peak season but also procuring them in  good time during the off season so as to ensure normal  production of chemical fertilizer and pesticide enterprises.  Enterprises may directly supply chemical fertilizers not under  unified state distribution to grass-roots supply and marketing  cooperatives or farm households through direct sales or joint  and commissioned sales with grass-roots supply and marketing  cooperatives of agricultural capital goods.    Gu Xiulian, minister of chemical industry, announced  specific  plans for chemical fertilizer production to ensure demand during  the spring farming season.</p>

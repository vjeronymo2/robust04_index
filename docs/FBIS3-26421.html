Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, Feb. 8 (CNA) -- The Dalai Lama is expected  to visit Taiwan in May or October in his capacity as a religious  leader, an elder brother of the Tibetan spiritual leader  announced at a news conference late Monday [7 February].    Gyalo Thundup, who led a four-member Tibetan group here,  said  that the Dalai Lama will meet with President Li Teng-hui,  Premier Lien Chan, other ranking government officials, and  religious leaders during his stay in Taiwan.    The Dalai Lama, who has received a letter each from  President  Li and Premier Lien, admired Taiwan's political and economic  achievements made during the past four decades, Thundup noted.    A possible visit by the Tibetan spiritual leader has stirred  great interest here since Chao Tze-chi, chairman of the World  League for Freedom and Democracy, extended a formal invitation  in 1992.    On Beijing's possible reaction, Thundup said that the Dalai  Lama paid no mind to Mainland China's views toward his planned  visit to Taiwan, nor did Beijing express opposition to the  visit. Currently, he pointed out, the Tibetan  government-in-exile makes frequent contacts with mainland  authorities.    The Dalai Lama has headed the Tibetan Government-in-Exile  since 1959 when he fled Lhasa, Tibet's capital city. Communist  Chinese troops launched military campaigns against Tibet in 1949  and occupied the land in 1951.    Meanwhile, Thundup noted, Premier Lien has given the green  light to the establishment of a liaison office in Taipei by the  exiled government. The exact time for the office's opening,  however, has yet to be worked out, he added.    The soon-to-be-established liaison office, aiming to  strengthen cultural exchanges, will be similar to other offices  around the world, he said.    Thundup, who studied at National Chengchi University in the  1940's and speaks fluent Mandarin, left for home Tuesday morning.    Chang Chun-yi, chairman of the cabinet-level Mongolian and  Tibetan Affairs Commission, said that the government, while  welcoming the Dalai Lama's visit, is deeply concerned about the  Tibetans in exile.    Statistics show that there are 120,000 exiled Tibetans in  India, 20,000 in Nepal, 8,000 in Sikkim, and 4,000 in Bhutan.    "We hope to work out with the Dalai Lama a solution to the  problems facing the Tibetan exiles such as education and health  care," Chang stressed.</p>

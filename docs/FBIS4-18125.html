			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Kg." report: "DM3,000 Premiums for Part-Time Work </F> Planned"]    [Text] Bonn, 28 Mar -- The Federal Government and the  coalition groups are discussing financial incentives for the  promotion of part-time work. These deliberations are under a  time constraint because corresponding measures would have to be  included in the draft of the 1994 employment promotion law,  which is to be decided by 14 April. The committee discussions  have not yet been concluded. On Monday [28 March] government  spokesman Norbert Schaefer announced that the chancellor will  invite the top associations of industry and the trade unions for  a talk on expanding the supply of part-time jobs.    Over the weekend, FRG Labor Minister Norbert Bluem advocated  providing financial aid of about 3,000 German marks [DM] per  part-time job, thus winning over employers for the creation of  such jobs. A one-time investment is economically more useful  than the expenditures for a jobless person, who costs about  DM2,000 per month, Bluem said. However, considerations do not  just revolve around the DM3,000 premium for the companies.  Rather, the intention is to pay the same amount to employees if  they change from full-time work to part-time work. The  unemployed are also to receive a premium of DM3,000 if they  accept a part-time job and not a full-time job. In practice,  the creation of a part-time job or the division of a full-time  job could require three times the premium of DM3,000 -- for the  employer, for the employee, and for the unemployed person hired  in addition. The premiums are to be paid by the Federal  Employment Office.    Chancellor Helmut Kohl seems to support these conditions,  because the government spokesman expressly "indicated additional  incentives to create more part-time work." The chancellor let  it be said that a "part-time offensive with imagination" is  needed. The Federation of German Employers' Associations (BDA)  and the trade unions are discussing how more part-time jobs  could be mobilized by means of a joint campaign. BDA Main  Manager Fritz-Heinz Himmelreich said that the employers'  associations are very interested in such an initiative.  However, Himmelreich was skeptical regarding material  incentives to promote part-time work. There is the danger of  follow-up effects. It would probably also be difficult to  persuade a former full-time worker who gets unemployment  benefits to take a part-time job.</p>

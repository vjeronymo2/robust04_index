			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Arts: The Libertine THIS is a bold, welcome staging by The Ten Trumpets Theatre Company of the first Don Juan play to reach the English stage. Thomas Shadwell's work was last performed in 1740 and it is easy to see why it has been resting for more than 250 years; and easier to see why it should be staged again now. Although it lacks dramatically, the 1990s make fertile ground for its issues: misogyny and men's self-deceit. The tragi-comic story is familiar enough. The Don's women turn either to doe-eyed devotion or wide-eyed anger. His sidekicks wallow in his miscreancies; all of them have a taste of hell - and the chance to repent - before the statuesque dinner guest hauls them off. The Don John character holds the play together, principally because Shadwell wrote no other substantial part. Jim McKechnie in the title role gives a remarkable performance. He manages to be consistently vicious and libidinous, in touch with his conscience long enough to enjoy ignoring it. Marcus Goodwin's direction speeds the plot; and there are good cameo pieces from Lia Zografou and Eddie Marsan. Pentameters Theatre, Hampstead (071) 435 3648, to 19 July</p>

			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Books: The days of a maverick - The life and times of a great eccentric YOUNGHUSBAND: THE LAST GREAT IMPERIAL ADVENTURER by Patrick French HarperCollins Pounds 20, 440 pages Francis Younghusband was one of the great eccentrics of the later British Empire, a large club which included Gordon, Baden-Powell, Meinertzhagen, and many more. Patrick French has given him an enthralling, well-written, revelatory and flawed biography. I am not sure about the sub-title - was Younghusband really the 'last great imperial adventurer'? (What about the Arabian gang, including TE Lawrence?) But he was certainly a great and maverick character whose invasion of Tibet in 1904 was only one episode in a dramatic life. 'Journalist, spy, guru, geographer, writer, staunch imperialist, Indian nationalist, philosopher and explorer' are listed by French (leaving out soldier and geriatric lover), and he adds: 'How had a blimpish colonialist managed to end up as a premature hippy?' Younghusband's exploits in Asia have of course been recorded before, most recently by Peter Hopkirk and Anthony Verrier, and before that by Peter Fleming and Jan Morris. The value of Mr French's book is that he tells us so much about the rest of the life: indeed, he has the wit to argue that the Tibetan adventure was merely 'a formative part of an extraordinary journey of personal discovery and development'. After 1908, when Younghusband retreated from India to Britain, he recedes from our history books; yet he became author, public figure, president of the Royal Geographical Society, founder of the 'Fight for Right' patriotic movement in 1915, commissioner of the Jerusalem anthem, promoter of the first Everest expeditions, forerunner of the 'Gaia' theories which are today favoured by Professor James Lovelock and the New Age movement, stalwart of the Travellers Club, mystic ('a religion of atheism' said his friend Bertrand Russell), supporter of Indian independence, philosopher, crank - and (Mr French's most delicious discovery) the passionate 76-year-old lover of Madeline, Lady Lees, with whom he published a marriage manual and to whom he wrote, 'The woman in you makes great appeal to me and rouses all the most manly in me. You are a remarkable illustration of the essential Creative Spirit of the World . . .'; he thought Lady Lees might be the Messiah (he had had a cold and unhappy marriage). Well might the biographer ask, after 300 pages, 'Was he barking mad?' To which the answer must be, not quite. Younghusband was a product of post-Mutiny Anglo-India and Clifton (where he acquired a lifelong friend in Sir Henry Newbolt and a habit of cold baths, which he continued to indulge at 20 degrees below in the Karakoram). The young Army officer with an Evangelical background and an interest in Buddhism began to have mystical experiences in the high mountains, and his colleagues must have been aware that a certain instability might accompany the compulsive risk-taking and extreme physical stamina - as the colonial phrase would put it, he tended to 'go bush'. He made an early name for himself on a crossing of the Gobi Desert and then as a young participant in the Great Game, in the remote region where Russia, China and British India met. It was Younghusband who, when sent to tame the Mir of Hunza in 1889 - 'I knew that he was a cur at heart, and I have no doubt he was impressed by my bearing' - encountered the Tsar's forward agent Grombtchevski; he deliberately mis-directed the Russian, almost to his death, an episode which surely must have inspired the scene in Kim, though Mr French does not mention it. The subsequent career was by no means smooth. Younghusband only got the Tibet expedition in 1903-4 because he was a chum of Lord Curzon. Mr French enjoys telling the story of this last round of the Great Game, without forgetting that the invasion was an unnecessary failure - the Viceroy and Younghusband sincerely believed that the Russians were in bed with the Tibetans, and were wrong. The advance on Lhasa was never intended by Balfour's government, and Younghusband, not so unfairly, was to be a scapegoat. That should not have surprised anyone: Younghusband was usually out of his depth in the world of diplomacy, whether in the Himalayas or in his mysterious, and still obscure, involvement in the Jameson Raid in 1895 Transvaal. Ninety years on, with the Chinese more than ever the imperial masters of Tibet, that useless British exercise looks even shoddier, less justifiable than ever. There is one serious flaw in this enjoyable read (apart from the inadequate maps, whereas the photographs are good). Mr French has chosen to tell this splendid tale in the framework of his own recent travels in the region 'to follow his trail'. There is surely something - well, immodest about this in the context of such superhuman exploration. Who cares about the young Mr French's stopover impressions of Kabul Airport? Who cares that he failed to follow the route of the 1903 invasion, failed to find the letters to the adored Mrs Douglas, fell ill in Calcutta, and overdramatises his own minor skirmish with the Indian Army in Sikkim? But to set against this we have a frequently happy turn of phrase - for example, of the west's fascination with the east, 'conquest and wonder dancing hand-in-hand' - and an eye for the apt quotation, as when Younghusband writes to a married lady he fancies, 'You would make a splendid Colonel of a Cavalry Regiment if you were a man . . .' Those were the days.</p>

			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASSEMBLYMAN HILL'S VOTE COSTS COLLEAGUE $3,600;  </P> <P> LEGISLATURE: THE AUTHOR OF A NO-FAULT AUTO INSURANCE MEASURE RENTS A PLANE TO  WHISK FRANK HILL OF WHITTIER TO THE CAPITOL FOR A VOTE ON THE BILL.  </P> <P> How much is one vote worth at the state Capitol?  </P> <P> In the case of Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier) last week, the answer was  more than $3,600.  </P> <P> That's how much one Democratic assemblyman paid to rent a private plane so that  Hill could show up to vote at the state Capitol on a controversial no-fault  auto insurance measure.  </P> <P> At the expense of Assemblyman Patrick Johnston of Stockton, Hill was whisked  Wednesday morning from an El Monte airport in a twin-turbo prop plane to a  landing strip 30 miles east of Sacramento -- a location selected to avoid the  low-lying winter fog. Once on the ground, Hill was greeted by a legislative  sergeant-at-arms, who promptly drove him to an Assembly committee meeting to  cast a vote for Johnston's no-fault bill.  </P> <P> Hill quickly left the room, was driven back to the foothill airstrip and hopped  on the plane back to Southern California, where he is running to fill a vacancy  in the 31st Senate District, which covers portions of Orange County and the  Southeast cities of Whittier, La Mirada and La Habra Heights. Then, Hill  delivered a noontime speech, got on a commercial airplane and once again flew  to Sacramento late Wednesday afternoon.  </P> <P> Despite Hill's extraordinary trip, Johnston's no-fault insurance bill was  defeated by one vote.  </P> <P> Johnston said he decided to fly Hill up to Sacramento because a preliminary  head count showed the vote on the bill would be close. Johnston said he wanted  to make sure all his supporters -- including Hill -- were present.  </P> <P> The cost: $3,645, paid out of Johnston's campaign fund.  </P> <P> "It was painful to expend the money, I assure you. But it was in the pursuit of  a governmental purpose," said Johnston.  </P> <P> Hill conceded that his morning flight on Wednesday was "unusual" but it was for  a good cause.  </P> <P> "It was a big bill," he said.  </P></p>

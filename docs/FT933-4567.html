			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Revival in demand lifts Headlam to Pounds 1.13m A REVIVAL in consumer demand has boosted the profits of Headlam, the acquisitive fabrics and flooring distribution group, in the first half of 1993, writes Tim Burt. Backed up by increased efficiency and tight financial controls the pre-tax profit climbed from Pounds 313,000 to Pounds 1.13m on turnover up by 78 per cent to Pounds 43m (Pounds 24m). Mr Ian Kirkham, chief executive, said the group was not planning further acquisitions in the near future but concentrating instead on improving the 'motley collection of (eight) businesses' purchased since January 1992. Mr Graham Waldron, chairman, said the profit growth mainly reflected the success of the floor covering division, particularly through demand for Aquatex, the industrial walkway product. Difficult trading conditions, however, had kept its footwear sector only at break-even levels; while the contribution of the fabric divisions was expected to be enhanced by the past year's acquisitions. Earnings per share increased from 0.86p to 2.88p and the interim dividend is stepped up from 0.75p to 0.85p.</p>

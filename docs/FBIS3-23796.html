			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Narek Mesropyan under the heading "Tight Spot": </F> "There Is No Alternative! Has There Ever Been?"]    [Text] We are, for all that, an amazing people. We were  constantly complaining that the factor of the absence of  statehood had over many centuries so strongly influenced our  minds that we harbored toward all authorities, if not a  scornful, then at least not exactly a respectful, attitude.  Gevorg Emin once wrote a poem on this subject: You need to  operate with care in our parts, he said, because each Armenian  is a tsar. Not potential. In the literal sense. He meant,  possibly, our historical past, when there were always too many  pretenders for the royal throne, and their number would grow  with menacing speed.    And so we lived, lived, and finally lived to see the day  when  there are once again very many potential tsars, but the social  consciousness sees just one on the throne.    At all street corners the talk is the same.    "Yes, Levon Ter-Petrosyan has not justified the trust. But  who, pray, could be put in his place?"    And after an agonizing search and mental thumbing through of  all the possible candidates, the conclusion is: There is no  alternative!    To explain this phenomenon by poverty of intellect and a  servile devotion to a created idol and the traces of the  totalitarian consciousness is to say nothing, even if the older  generation of those alive today, which sobbed bitterly the day  Stalin died, is, of course, very directly related to all these  phenomena of social behavior. Nonetheless, even they, who were  once capable of thinking in all seriousness of personal  assistance to the revolutionary movement of the peoples of  Africa, could not be lured into a revolution now.    And, then, what kind of revolution or radical  transformations  or restoration of social justice could be dreamed of by a  people, 70 percent of whom plainly state, as a sociological  survey showed, their desire to leave their homeland? And people  should not be reprimanded for a lack of patriotic spirit here.  Armenians are leaving not Armenia but Levon Ter-Petrosyan and  his hapless team, who have made the blessed motherland a segment  of the seventh circle of hell. Reproaching the emigres would  mean antedating a curse on ancestors who in the past abandoned  Ani, which was sold, incidentally, initially to the Byzantines,  and then, to the Seljuks.    Of what alternative could a people which, if they do not  steal and do not profiteer, have earnings equal to the cost of  two eggs be thinking? And as for a search for the truth, when  the voracious survival instinct has begun to speak at the top of  its voice?    Our mentality is such that we seek a possible alternative  merely among those who have had or who now have at least some  relationship to power. The earlier ones are out of the question:  If there are, indeed, potential saviors among them, they are so  thoroughly concealed that scraping away the camouflage would  take too much time, which, incidentally, neither we nor they  have. The president is dispatching the present ones, however,  with savage economy: Four premiers in less than three years are  obvious testimony to this. Not to mention all the others who  come and go, but who never mature to the level of real  alternative to the president. And real power, meanwhile, is  concentrated in the hands of people who would never ascend to  the highest rung of the state hierarchy other than by way of a  military or police coup. And the more the popular wave  undermines their reputation, the dearer they become to the  president's heart.    There is nothing new in the leader's attitude toward his  immediate entourage here, of course. All has been well known,  unfortunately, since ancient times, in which our country has  experts enough. As a result an ideology of futility, which is  harmful for all except those who are assiduously feeding this  ideology by their actions, is engendered. Thanks to them, we  have had no alternative in any period of our life, virtually. I  shall not list by name all the former leaders of Armenia in past  decades but the older generation would, most likely, confirm  that not one of them formerly was, seemingly, an alternative,  but as soon as a new one appeared, the heavens did not open and  the grass continued to grow, and if there was no bread in the  stores, it was only for several days.    There is, however we all may be fooled in this connection,  an  alternative, even when there is no choice.</p>

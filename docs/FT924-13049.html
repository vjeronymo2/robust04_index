			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Holy videos] It's your chance to be the caped crusader VIDEO game enthusiasts will soon be able to put themselves in Batman's shoes to exchange blows with the Penguin or cuddle with Catwoman. Or they could choose to make a music video using film footage of popular rock musicians. Sega, the Japanese electronic games manufacturer, this week unveiled a compact disc-based video games system which will allow users to interact with characters in Hollywood films as well as with popular bands on video. The system is the first to bring realistic, digitised video film games to the consumer market. The videos and films that Sega will incorporate into its new games will initially come from the libraries of Hollywood studios, such as Warner Brothers, and music video publishers, including Sony Electronic Publishing, with which the company simultaneously announced a strategic alliance to develop CD-based games. 'Up to this point video games have been animated characters. Sega CD allows players to control real actors. It's like being in a movie theatre and controlling the actors on the screen,' says Mr Doug Glen, group marketing director. Sega has also set up a multimedia studio in Redwood City, California, and is filming a game alongside Steven Spielberg, on the set of his film Jurassic Park. The game will be launched at the same time as the film. Video games are increasingly expected to be based on CDs, which offer better sound quality, graphics and greater storage capacity and manipulating power than the games cartridges currently in use. Nintendo, Sega's main competitor, announced this week it would launch a CD-based games system in the US and Japan in August 1993. Sega will launch its new system in the US next month at a suggested retail price of Dollars 299 (Pounds 173.80). Digital's bright dawn, Page 11</p>

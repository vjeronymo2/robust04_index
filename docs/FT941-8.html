			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Greece sees crisis in Italy soon Greek European Affairs Minister Theodoros Pangalos has predicted impending political crisis and instability in Italy following this week's general election, Reuter reports from Athens. Mr Pangalos, known for his frank, outspoken manner which in the past has upset some of Greece's European Union partners, was speaking in an interview with state television channel ET2 which was held on Tuesday and made available to Reuters. 'We are entering a period of crisis, of instability in Italy. This is very unpleasant not only because we are neighbours of this great country with which we have traditionally had good relations, but also because we will have among us, especially in the European Union, a government with no power,' he said. He said the victory of the Freedom Alliance, in which tycoon Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party has the most seats, was based on the 'magic of the media and populist preachings on morality, happiness and the liberation of citizens from taxes'. 'This populist alliance won the election,' Mr Pangalos said. 'It is indeed an extreme example of how the law of the media rules.' He said he could not see how Berlusconi's group of parties could form a solid majority. The Italian election result showed Europeans 'tend to turn to dead-end solutions' when faced with social, economic and cultural impasses.</p>

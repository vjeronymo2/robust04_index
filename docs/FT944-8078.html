			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Labour presses for regulation of gas salaries The Labour party is to try to extend the role of the gas industry's regulatory regime to cover excessive salary increases for top executives. Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow trade and industry secretary, told the Commons last night in the resumed debate on the Queen's Speech that Labour would try to provide the additional powers through an amendment to the government bill to increase competition in the gas industry. He underlined the challenge the amendment would provide for Conservative backbenchers who had criticised the 75 per cent salary rise - to Pounds 475,000 - for Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas. He said the salary increases were a 'scandal' and condemned Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, for lacking the courage to oppose them. Mr Heseltine insisted that since privatisation British Gas had improved its competitiveness and profitability. He told jeering Labour MPs that it was the success of the government's privatisation policy that had forced them to abandon threats of re-nationalisation. Mr Heseltine recalled that Mr John Major, the prime minister, had stressed that the government believed it was necessary for executives to exercise 'restraint' in awarding salary increases. Such increases would also be subject to judgment by the market and by shareholders. Downing Street said, however, that although Mr Major would not comment on the particular case of British Gas, he felt 'very strongly' about excessive pay rises. A spokesman said that if shareholders in a private company felt pay rises were excessive, they could take action to curb them. Mr Jeremy Hanley, the Conservative party chairman, added his voice to criticisms of the pay shake-up when he told Channel 4 News: 'I think that it is insensitive and there is no doubt at all that there will be much criticism of that decision.' Meanwhile, Mr Brown yesterday insisted he would have earned Pounds 400,000 under his old pay deal, which included bonuses. Now he will just receive the basic pay. He added: 'I have got nothing to do with setting my salary at all. Non-executive directors decide what they think is fair remuneration; they decide my salary.'</p>

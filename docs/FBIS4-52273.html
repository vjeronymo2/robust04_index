			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 9 (YONHAP) -- Short-term credits for  exports worth up to 20,000 U.S. dollars will no longer be  subject to government approval, regardless of whether they are  made on a documents-against-acceptance or payment basis,  starting next year.    Under the eased trade rules announced by the Ministry of  Trade, Industry and Energy on Monday, exports and imports of  goods worth up to 10,000 dollars -- instead of the current 5,000  dollars -- will be exempt from after-export and -import controls  on traders regarding whether they meet the conditions set down  in the export and import permits.    At present, only letter of credit-based exports of goods  worth up to 20,000 dollars can be made without the government's  approval.    Documents-against-acceptance and payment bills are means of  receiving payment for export shipments: While the former  requires the delivery of shipping documents to importers when  they accept the bill of exchange, the latter demands the handing  over of documents in exchange for payment of the bill.    The new rules also provide that exports on a sight-bill  basis, that is, a bill of exchange payable when presented to the  importer, shall be made without a government permit, regardless  of the exports' amount.    Exporters of industrial plants and machinery will be allowed  to acquire necessary materials and equipment locally in the  importing countries and be exempt from the requirement to  contribute to the export promotion fund.    Moreover, imports of research and development equipment in  relatively small demand can be made from any market. At  present, importation of all research and development equipment  from certain markets is prohibited.</p>

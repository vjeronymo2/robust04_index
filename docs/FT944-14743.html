As Russia's President Yeltsin ponders more unrest among his ministers, he must occasionally cast envious glances at the growing business career of his predecessor, Mikhail Gorbachev. Gorbachev is currently starring in a German ad campaign for Apple Computer and features as a fearfully busy pin-striped executive who will not accept anything but the very best when buying computers for his Green Cross International environmental organisation. 'The more freedom Mikhail Gorbachev has in his work, the better,' purs the glossy advertisement. For his part, Gorby says: 'One is either part of the solution or part of the problem. I decided on the first.' Presumably he is talking about his computer rather than his abbreviated political career.</p>

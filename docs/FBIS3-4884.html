			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] To get to the bottom of the issue concerning Prime  Minister Hosokawa's borrowing 100 million yen [Y] from Tokyo  Sagawa Kyubin Co., the House of Representatives Budget Committee  has recently decided that, in accordance with Article 104 of the  Diet law, it will exercise the right of investigation in  relation to government to call on such organs as the Tokyo  District Public Prosecutors Office to submit documents retained  from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co. However, the government has  indicated it will reject the call. In response, the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] has strongly reacted to the government's  attitude. Regarding the government's attitude as "a serious  infringement on the right of investigation and an act of  overriding the Diet's authority," the LDP plans to persistently  call on the government to turn in documents. At the same time,  if the government rejects the call, the LDP plans to increase  its call for summoning Mr. Masatoshi Fukayama, former official  secretary of the prime minister, to appear in the Diet. Since  the Diet adopted the third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993,  which the government believes will contribute to boosting the  domestic economy, the LDP intends to demand a thorough  investigation of suspicion attached to the prime minister during  the course of Diet deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget bill.    In addition, with regard to the issue concerning the  father-in- law of the prime minister's suspected dealings in a  large quantity of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone [NTT] Corp  stocks, the LDP thinks that "one person who greatly profited  from NTT stocks transactions might have been the prime minister  himself." For that reason, the LDP plans to take up this issue  and call for summoning an investment consultant allegedly  involved in the transactions in addition to Mr. Fukayama, the  prime minister's former secretary.    On the issue of the prime minister's pecuniary relation with  Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co., attention has been focused on whether  the prime minister really returned Y100 million to Sagawa  Kyubin. In this connection, at the last extraordinary Diet  session, the prime minister submitted to a board of directors of  the Budget Committees of both the House of Representative and  the House of Councillors six "related documents proving that the  money was all returned." However, the LDP said that "it is hard  to believe that the submitted documents are real documents," and  called on the government to submit the originals, which the  Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office confiscated from Tokyo  Sagawa Kyubin Co., in accordance with Article 104 of the Diet  law which allows the Diet to "demand the government and public  agencies submit reports or documents." Although the ruling  parties first indicated it would reject the LDP's demand, an  agreement was eventually reached via mediation of Yamaguchi,  House of Representatives Budget Committee chairman (who belongs  to the Social Democratic Party of Japan), between the ruling  parties and the opposition camp at the House of Representatives  Budget Committee session held on 22 February on exercising the  right of investigation in relation to government.    In response, however, the Justice Ministry has shown its  intention not to accept the Budget Committee's demand on the  grounds that "since the case involving Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co.  is under trial, submission of documents will impede further  investigations." Justice Minister Mikazuki told a news  conference held after a 25 February Cabinet meeting that  "documents have been gathered in accordance with the Criminal  Procedures Act, and submitting them may impede further  investigations, affect trials, or disturb the privacy of people  concerned," thus indicating a stand of rejecting the demand.    Such a reaction of the Justice Ministry has invited the  LDP's  objection. The LDP stresses that "we cannot accept such a  manner which infringes the Diet's right of investigation in  relation to the government." The LDP views that "the ruling  parties must have known that the government would reject the  call, and with this in mind, they have agreed on exercising  Article 104 of the Diet law." In this way, the LDP is  increasingly dissatisfied with the ruling parties' manner. For  that reason, within the LDP, there has emerged a hardline view  saying that "at Diet sessions on the fiscal 1994 budget bill,  the LDP should not cooperate in promoting deliberations on the  bill until the Diet summoning of Mr. Fukayama is held"  (according to a senior Diet Affairs Committee member).</p>

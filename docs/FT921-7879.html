			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Gradually increasing strength in Australian and other wool values during the previous two weeks continued to develop this week. The Australian Wool Corporation's market indicator passed through the 600 cent mark, a record since the free market was resumed just 12 months ago, and by February 19th was at 619 cents, with every sign of moving higher. Clearances are good and price rises now apply throughout the range, including finer merinos which have for a long time shown relative and often actual softness. The wool market's rise is accompanied by heavier stockpile sales in Australia, with nearly 56,000 bales sold last week.</p>

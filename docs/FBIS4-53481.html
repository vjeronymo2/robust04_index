			<p>BFN     [Text] Pusan, May 17 (YONHAP) -- All 22 South Korean  fishermen returned to Pusan Tuesday from a Chinese port, where  they were taken after being seized by Chinese patrol boats in  the East China Sea for alleged violation of Chinese waters late  last month. The return of the fishermen and their boat, the  Taehung-ho No. 27, follows an agreement reached between South  Korean and Chinese officials last Friday in the southern port of  Shanghai. The fishermen, all of whom appeared healthy despite  their long detention, said they left Shanghai for Pusan last  Sunday, 16 days after being seized.    The Pusan Maritime Police are questioning the fishermen to  ascertain the situation at the time of the seizure.    Eleven fishermen from the Songkwang-ho No. 2 were whisked  away by a Chinese patrol boat around noon on April 29 in waters  220 miles southwest of Mosulpo, Cheju Island, where they were  drifting due to engine failure, the fishermen said.    The Chinese patrol boat was initially tugging the fishing  boat but it cut the tow rope when the Songkwang-ho No. 1 gave  chase, they said.    About half an hour later the same day, the Taehung-ho No. 27  was seized by another Chinese patrol boat in waters 175 miles  southwest of Mosulpo when the fishing boat also suffered engine  trouble, they insisted. All 11 fishermen on board were taken  away.    China had demanded a fine of 100,000 U.S. dollars for  violating Chinese waters and illegal fishing. They later  lowered the amount to 13,728 dollars, covering the price of fish  allegedly illegally caught by the South Korean boats and the  fishermen's living expenses during their detention.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] We continue to update you with the situation on the  Tajikistan border. This is what our correspondent Valentin  Nikulin has told us:    [Nikulin] The situation on the Tajik-Afghan border remains  complicated. Almost daily the Russian border guards have to  repel provocations from armed detachments of the Tajik  opposition which is based in the northern provinces of  Afghanistan. The leaders of the opposition, aware of the large  military potential of the border guards, as well as of the  15,000-strong contingent of peace-keeping forces that have  arrived to support them, have resorted to the very wily tactics  of silent infiltration across the border by small, well-armed,  and trained groups instead of a massive spring-summer offensive.  Their aim is to set up bases and arms depots on the territory  of Tajikistan, as well as to carry out acts of sabotage.    The movements of the bands and formations are under the  close  observation of the Tajik special services. As a result of a  recent three-days operation carried out jointly with the Russian  border guards, about 30 transgressors were destroyed, a  Pakistani military advisor among them. A depot containing 200  nonguided missiles and antiaircraft guns was destroyed, as well  as a lot of other arms.    A dozen attempts to violate the almost 1,200km-long border  have been foiled. In particular, in one of the sectors of the  border in the Pamir mountains, border guards' fire stopped 25  armed transgressors from illegally crossing the border. By the  way, 10 of them were of Arab origin, according to military  intelligence. This fact proves once more that the claim of the  Tajik opposition leaders that no foreign mercenaries are taking  part in their fight against the present regime in Tajikistan is  false.    And one more scandalous fact from life on the border which  was related to us at a press conference by Lieutenant-General  Anatoliy Chechulin, commander of a group of Russian Federation  border troops. On 8 June an explosive device was discovered and  deactivated here by a Russian border guards detachment. It had  been placed by unknown persons on a barge that transported  refugees returning home from Afghanistan. The resolute and  skillful actions of the border guards averted the death of 242  persons, mainly women and children. A day later, at 0610 on 9  June, the 11th outpost of the Moscow border guards detachment  suffered concentrated shelling from the territory of  Afghanistan. Twenty-six missiles were fired directly at it over  a short period of time. As a result of this action one  serviceman of the Tajikistan Defense Ministry was killed, and  another was wounded. Both of them were serving in a subunit of  the republican Defense Ministry, which was sent to reinforce  border security.</p>

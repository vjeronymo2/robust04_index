			<p>BFN     [Text] President Sam Nujoma of Namibia made a brief  stopover in Accra this morning on his way to Belgium for a state  visit. He was met at the airport by the vice president, Mr.  K.N. Arkaah.    President Nujoma told newsmen that Belgium played a key role  in Namibia's struggle for independence. He recalled that in  1972 and 1986, SWAPO [South West African People's Organization]  organized international conferences to solicit support from the  international community for the liberation struggle and Belgium  readily came to her aid. According to the Namibian leader, he  is going to Belgium to meet friends and consolidate their  relationship. He said Namibia has a lot of raw materials while  Belgium has technology. Both countries can, therefore, enter  into viable ventures.    President Nujoma said Namibia will also consolidate her  relationship with South Africa to ensure regional economic  unity. He noted that South Africa is a big country with a large  population and will be expected to play a major role in  consolidating African economic community. On Rwanda, President  Nujoma said the tragedy in that country calls for international  intervention. He stressed the need for the United Nations to  cooperate with the OAU to restore peace.</p>

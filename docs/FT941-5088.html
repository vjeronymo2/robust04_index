			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / International Company News: Turnround at Finnish metals group Outokumpu, the Finnish mining and metals group, achieved a FM297m (Dollars 53m) profit before extraordinary items in 1993, ending a three-year run of losses despite weak market conditions. The result, a sharp turnround on 1992's FM360m deficit, was helped by the weaker Finnish markka, restructuring, reduced exchange losses and lower interest rates. However, the group will again pay no dividend, partly because of the uncertain market outlook. Mr Jyrki Juusela, chief executive, warned conditions would remain difficult in early 1994 although 'demand for metals and metal prices are expected to improve moderately during the next few months'. He promised further restructuring of the group's copper products division, which remained in the red in 1993 with a FM502m loss before extraordinary items. The group's three other divisions, base metals, stainless steel and technology, all reported profits, although low metal prices meant the base metals surplus sank to FM152m from FM404m. Best performer was the stainless steel division which lifted profits before extraordinary items to FM708m from FM349m. Group sales expanded to FM15.8bn from FM15.1bn, thanks to the improved trend within stainless steel and technology. Operating income amounted to FM846m, against FM604m, while net financial expenses fell to FM644m from FM1.06bn. Group debt has fallen and equity has risen following the disposal of OM Group of the US and two share offerings. The Finnish government is looking to reduce the state's 50.1 per cent ownership of Outokumpu as part of its broader privatisation programme. Parliament has already authorised a reduction in the state holding to 33.4 per cent. Metra, the Finnish world leader in diesel power units, yesterday reported a profit after financial items in 1993 of FM472m, a sharp rebound from a loss in 1992 of FM 40m. The group also announced the launch of two convertible capital note issues of up to FM300m each to reduce borrowings. Net debt stood at FM4.6bn at the end of 1993, down from FM5bn, and the gearing ratio stood at 2.05. Metra, which has its main businesses in diesel engines, sanitary ware and security products, said it was raising the dividend to FM2.80 per share from FM2.00.</p>

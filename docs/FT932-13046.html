			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Yeltsin heads for victory on key poll issue MR BORIS Yeltsin was last night heading for victory on a key issue in the Russian referendum with early results showing a clear majority of voters declaring trust in him as president. However, his attempt to achieve the degree of backing which he requires to force new parliamentary elections was in the balance. The delayed struggle between president and parliament is likely to resume, in heightened form, as both sides interpret the referendum differently. If the early results are confirmed, Mr Yeltsin will claim a mandate for sweeping economic and constitutional change while parliament will insist that his failure to win the majority of the 106m electorate has deprived him of authority for radical action on any issue. A Russian television exit poll in 16 cities across the country showed Mr Yeltsin winning 75 per cent support in the vote of confidence, the first of the four questions being asked yesterday. Both the first and the second question, which asks Russians whether they support economic reforms started in 1992, require only a 50 per cent majority of those who voted. An exit poll of just over 5,000 voters by the Russian Centre for Public Opinion and Market Research found 56 per cent backing market reforms: parliament insisted on the question and a resounding No might have been expected, given the hardship caused by the reforms. The third and fourth questions, on early presidential and parliamentary elections, require a majority of the electorate. The first results, from the Koryak autonomous district, from some districts in the city of Magadan and from the town of Anadyr, all in the far east, showed around 70 per cent of those voting answering Yes to the question on trust in the president - which Mr Yeltsin had identified as the most important to him. There were lower majorities supporting economic reform. High percentages voted for re-election of the parliament in many areas. But, according to the pro-Yeltsin Public Headquarters for the Referendum, low turnout meant this was not enough to secure the 50 per cent majority of the total electorate required by the Constitutional Court for early elections. In the far eastern city of Khabarovsk, only 25 per cent of the eligible electorate supported early parliamentary elect-ions. Mr Yeltsin has already indicated, however, that he would consider a simple majority enough to dissolve the parliament and push through a new constitution which the old-style Congress of People's Deputies has resisted. In the preliminary Magadan results, 60 per cent of the total electorate supported new parliamentary elections. In the president's own home town of Yekaterinburg, this figure was more than 50 per cent. The turnout was reported by local representatives of the president to be averaging 60 per cent or a little over - not high by Russian standards, but higher than feared by some of the president's aides, especially in good weather which tempted many to their country houses. By mid-afternoon, it was clear that over 50 per cent had voted - the qualifying mark for the referendum to be valid.</p>

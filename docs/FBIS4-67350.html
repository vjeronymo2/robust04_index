			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wang Shabin [3769 1421 1755] and Su Weihan [5685 </F> 4850 3466], Ecological and Environmental Research Center, CAS,  Beijing: "Nitrous Oxide Emission Levels in China"; manuscript  revised 24 Nov 1992]    [Excerpts] Abstract -- The sources and magnitudes of  nitrous oxide emissions in China are described and analyzed. The  annual emission of nitrous oxide in China is 950 gigagrams (as  nitrogen), equivalent to about 6 percent of the world total.  Natural sources account for 71 percent of the total and human  sources for 29 percent. The primary natural source is the sea,  and the most important human source is the combustion of coal.  It is calculated that in the next few years the rate of increase  of N2O emissions will be 6 gigagrams per year (as  nitrogen)    Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an important atmospheric  trace gas which both contributes to the greenhouse effect and  can destroy ozone in the stratosphere. Atmospheric  N2O levels have increased greatly from their  pre-Industrial Revolution levels, reaching 310 ppbV in 1990, and  the annual rate of increase is now between 0.2 and 0.3 percent.  Although N2O makes a major contribution to global  environmental change, there are still difficulties in  identifying and quantifying its sources. It was formerly  believed that the use of agricultural fertilizers and the  combustion of fossil fuels were the factors causing global  N2O levels to rise. But recent research has shown  that the results of earlier calculations were overstated, and as  a consequence, more detailed efforts to identify N2O  sources and to forecast N2O concentrations are being  made.    Because N2O levels vary from region to region and  from country to country, any limits imposed on its emission must  take account of the particular conditions of each country.  Calculated country-by-country or region-by-region emission  figures are of great importance in the development of  appropriate control policies in each country and are also of  great reference value in calculating the global N2O  budget. Since China is a large, developing nation, the trace  gases emitted by its industry and agriculture may constitute an  important fraction of total global emissions of greenhouses  gases. Wang Mingxing [3769 2494 2502] has made an estimate of  methane emissions in China, but there have been relatively few  efforts to determine the emission sources of other trace gases  in China. In this paper, using domestic statistics and following  the most recent OECD methodology for calculating trace gas  emissions, we analyze domestic N2O sources and their  relative contributions.    Nitrous oxide emissions can be classified as natural and  manmade. Among the natural sources, we shall concentrate on  emissions from soil and water. Table 1 gives statistics on  N2O emissions in China, classified by source.  <H5>  Table 1 </H5>   3. Annual Change in N2O Emissions    Human activity has altered the global environment and is  producing a great effect on atmospheric N2O levels.  Changes in the natural environment and the development of  industry and agriculture have caused fluctuations in emissions  by various N2O sources. Below we shall present crude  estimates of the changes in N2O sources that are  likely to result from various factors in the next few years  (Table 2).    In China, housing construction, desertification and other  land-use factors are causing a gradual decrease in the arable  land area, which may cause a decrease in N2O  emissions from the soil. It is estimated that an annual decrease  of 5 million hm[.sup]2[/] in the area of arable land and  grassland will result in an annual decrease of 3.0 Gg  (gigagrams) in N2O [here and below, all figures for  nitrous oxide are expressed as nitrogen]. But with accelerated  economic development, the consumption of fossil fuels will rise  steadily, producing an increase in N2O emissions.  The combustion of coal, oil and natural gas in stationary  facilities will cause increases of respectively 2.8, 0.3, and  0.03 Gg of N2O per year, for a total of 3.1 Gg.  Similarly, the total N2O emissions from mobile  sources will increase by 0.3 Gg. An annual increase of 1.4 x  10[.sup]8[/] kg in fertilizer use will cause direct release  of 1.6 Gg N2O from the soil, together with the  emission of 1.6 Gg of N2O from groundwaters. The  burning of straw from crops will produce an annual increase of  2.3 Gg N2O per year; but this is an upper limit:  because the energy structure of agriculture is changing and  fossil fuels are gradually replacing plant fuels as an energy  source, in the next few years N2O emissions should  increase by about 6 Gg.  <H5>  Table 2. </H5>   4. Conclusions. Our analysis indicates that the total amount  of N2O emitted in China is 950 Gg per year (as  nitrogen), with natural and manmade sources accounting for  respectively 71 and 29 percent of the total. It is reported that  the total world emission of N2O is 14 to 15 Tg  (teragrams). Thus, China's N2O emissions account for  about 6 percent of the world total. The calculations show that  China's N2O emissions are primarily from natural  sources, chiefly marine sources. Because China burns very large  amounts of coal, this source represents a rather large fraction  of manmade N2O emissions. Owing to changes in  various factors, in the next few years the net annual increase  in N2O emissions will be 6 Gg N2O.</p>

			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'VINELAND' ENDS THOMAS PYNCHON'S LITERARY SILENCE, BUT NOT MYSTERY  </P> <P> "I just needed a vacation from my life. You never heard of that?" -- From  Thomas Pynchon's "Vineland"  </P> <P> One of the longer literary silences of modern times will come to an end this  week with the release of 100,000 copies of "Vineland," Thomas Pynchon's eagerly  awaited and closely guarded new novel.  </P> <P> In "Gravity's Rainbow," his 17-year-old previous effort -- still touted by some  high-powered fans as quite possibly the greatest American novel of the century  -- there's a metaphor that explains what will happen: "A screaming comes across  the sky."  </P> <P> That, in one of the most famous first sentences of American literature since  "Call me Ishmael," is how the novel begins, with the descent of one of Hitler's  V-2 bombs onto London.  </P> <P> But these rockets travel faster than the speed of sound: If you can hear a V-2  coming in, that means it must already have landed elsewhere, and you're safe.  Whereas if you hear nothing, you may soon be dead.  </P> <P> First, as one critic put it, the annihilation. Then the warning.  </P> <P> So it is with "Vineland."  </P> <P> No galleys were issued to reviewers or foreign publishers, the first time  anyone can remember this being done with a novel. Everyone will be making their  minds up at the same time.  </P> <P> That, at least, was the way it was supposed to be.  </P> <P> Yet, as sometimes happens with these things, samizdat (clandestine) manuscripts  are surfacing. At least three unauthorized readers -- all real Pynchon buffs --  profess themselves disappointed, meaning either their expectations were too  high or that it's not an easy task to follow up what is quite possibly the  greatest American etc.  </P> <P> Perhaps more damning is the fact that none of the three had finished it yet.  </P> <P> "A lot of it seems to be trying to send up contemporary California culture,  which is a topic that's certainly been done and done and done," says one of  these fans. "The Pynchon I like best is very highly wrought, multilayered,  embedded with puns and metaphors. Everything has more than one possible  meaning, which is where the paranoia comes from. But 'Vineland' seems lacking  in that ambiguity and wit, with too much of his hep-cat attitudinizing."  </P> <P> Others disagree.  </P> <P> "It's a book that isn't comparable to much of anything," says David Willis  McCullough, one of the Book-of-the-Month-Club judges who chose it as a main  selection. "I think we're far enough away from the '60s now that even people  who aren't nostalgic are curious. It's sort of, 'What did you do in the great  '60s, Daddy?' And 'Vineland' seems a marvelous farewell to that era."  </P> <P> The title comes from mythical Vineland County in Northern California, scene of  much of the action.  </P> <P> In a roundabout way, this is a novel about the war on drugs, although it  probably won't do much to brighten Drug Czar William Bennett's Christmas.  Everyone wants to ice thuggish federal prosecutor Brock Vond, and for Vond --  who deploys the largest assemblage of paramilitary forces this side of Tom  Clancy -- the feeling is mutual.  </P> <P> Zoyd Wheeler is the hero. He's an off-beat type who once each year jumps  through a Vineland storefront window, just for the hell of it, and spends much  of his free time obsessing "about his wife -- he never would get too  comfortable with 'ex-wife' -- and managing to bum out everybody inside a radius  even these days considered respectable."  </P> <P> He used to play the lounge piano for Kahuna Airlines, a very deregulated  operation where the passengers arriving in Honolulu weren't always the same as  those departing Los Angeles. Yes, it's that kind of novel.  </P> <P> "Why should things be easy to understand?" Pynchon once supposedly asked a  friend, but in "Vineland" he seems to have succumbed to the urge. You can  already hear the reviewers sniffing wounded prey. Thomas Pynchon's long-awaited  novel wasn't worth the wait. . . .  </P> <P> Yet even if the critics vote thumbs down, those 100,000 copies will still sell  on the mystery of the man himself. The betting in the literary community is  that, no matter how good or bad "Vineland" is, it will be the season's  fashionable novel -- the one to leave strategically on your coffee table and to  casually mention at cocktail parties.  </P> <P> It's the appeal of the concealed. In an age when everyone sooner or later shows  up on "Nightline" or "Donahue," Pynchon has achieved the remarkable trick of  becoming progressively less visible.  </P> <P> As long ago as his first novel, "V." (1963), he was a fuzzy, blurry, barely  discernible image, one who led Life magazine photographers on a fruitless chase  through the wilds of Mexico.  </P> <P> Now he's gone off the screen entirely.  </P> <P> The last published picture is in his 1953 high-school yearbook; the most recent  personal details date from the mid-'70s. In the 1980s, not one verifiable fact  has materialized.  </P> <P> Is it true he has no possessions and sleeps on the floor at the homes of his  friends and agent? That he will spend hours or days researching, say, the best  kind of brick, and will visit the river bank in Philadelphia where the clay  comes from just so he can refer to it with assurance? That he once stocked his  kitchen not with groceries but empty Hills Brothers coffee cans? That, back in  the '60s, he made off with writer Jules Siegel's wife, as Siegel complained at  great length in the pages of Playboy? Or that, when you take away being a great  writer, there's almost nothing interesting about him? And just why the heck is  he this way, anyway?  </P> <P> Add all the rumors up and you have a picture of an obsessive, cunning,  determined writer, one who not surprisingly has chosen paranoia as his chief  subject.  </P> <P> Pynchon doesn't want to be traced and has gone to every effort to make it  impossible to do so.  </P> <P> If his life can't be known, however, it's still possible to measure his shadow.  </P> <P> This story, then, isn't so much about Pynchon as his effect on John Calvin  Batchelor, one of many awaiting the new book, one of a number of novelists  influenced by the last.  </P> <P> The career of Batchelor, respected but little known, began with a series of  articles in an obscure New York weekly back in 1976 and '77. The thesis: Thomas  Pynchon was and always had been a pseudonym for the second most-secretive  writer in America, J.D. Salinger.  </P> <P> In a Cuban restaurant near Columbia University, Batchelor picks up a copy of  "Gravity's Rainbow," which even in paperback is the size of a couple of bricks.  One clue, he notes, involves the poets Emily Dickinson and Rainer Maria Rilke.  </P> <P> "Both are Salinger's heroes, and both are in here," he says, pointing to the  copyright page, where the only two writers acknowledged are Dickinson and  Rilke. "Salinger saw himself as retiring up there in New Hampshire, the same  way Dickinson had. It all clicked."  </P> <P> It makes a certain amount of sense.  </P> <P> When Pynchon published his first two stories in 1959, the already-reclusive  Salinger was in an extremely uncomfortable position: sought out by his adoring  fans while simultaneously strafed by the critics.  </P> <P> "A nom de plume," Batchelor wrote in the Soho News, "now afforded Salinger the  anonymity he had sought but failed to find as Caulfield's creator. It was the  perfect cover."  </P> <P> And there was Salinger saying sometime after he published a long story in the  New Yorker in 1965 (still his last printed work) that "he was writing fine,  don't worry about him, he was writing about his war experiences. And it just so  happened that 'Gravity's Rainbow' was about the same kind of war experiences  Salinger had. This is very creepy, but Salinger was a member of a four-man  counterintelligence squad, and his job at the end of the war was to interrogate  German soldiers. He was looking for SS and Gestapo and other outlaws. And in  'Gravity's Rainbow' one of the things that is done is to interrogate a former  German officer."  </P> <P> There's much more, but this no doubt is enough. "Sweet, but crazy," was one  reporter's verdict on Batchelor at the time.  </P> <P> Keep in mind, though, that Salinger hadn't been heard from in a decade, that  exactly nothing was known about Pynchon, and that stranger things have  happened. Moreover, Batchelor, fresh from Scottish divinity school, had the  virtue of sincerity.  </P> <P> "At no point did I not think I was right," he says. "That's how inside the  story I was. I proceeded with gravity. Soberly. I talked to all parties again  and again. I told them what I was doing. I wanted them to tell me I was wrong.  No one would."  </P> <P> As a device for finding out facts about Pynchon, it also worked well.  Batchelor's articles revealed more than any up to that time. He found the  novelist's editor, his publisher, agent, and the judges who voted to give him  the National Book Award, the Faulkner Prize, the Pulitzer, the Howells Medal  (given to the most distinguished work of fiction to be published in a five-year  period).  </P> <P> It was the first writing Batchelor had done. He didn't even have a phone. He  called people such as New York Times book reviewer Christopher Lehmann-Haupt,  high-brow critics Elizabeth Hardwick and Benjamin DeMott, and New Yorker editor  William Shawn (whose secretary blocked the call) from a pay phone in the  street.  </P> <P> "They didn't know," Batchelor says, then corrects himself: "Well, sometimes  they did. I had to drop in another dime."  </P> <P> When "Nightline" wanted a successful but poor writer a couple years ago to put  on opposite Stephen King, Batchelor was chosen.  </P> <P> Now 41, he looks ascetic, determined, a 24-hour-a-day writer, although in truth  he recently got married to a minister and they are expecting a child.  </P> <P> His novels share the same baroque, fertile mind-set that could conceive of and  believe in Salinger and Pynchon being one.  </P> <P> First was a satirical jape on Halley's comet; his second can be explained by  the title, "The Birth of the People's Republic of Antarctica." The third,  "American Falls," is a Civil War tale that the Washington Post, in a front-page  Book World review, called "unusual, brilliant and compelling."  </P> <P> "It must have been the times," Batchelor explained in a letter. "In '73, Nixon  was swinging hard. The year started like a farce gone black and blue. In  January, Solzhenitsyn risked everything again, agreeing that the YMCA Press  should publish 'Gulag.' Tass called him anti-Soviet and pro-Tsarist. Three  weeks later, L.B.J. died and the court passed down Roe vs. Wade and Kissinger  announced the Vietnam peace accord. . . . In spring, Pynchon issued "GR" in a  $15 (!) hardback edition. Then John Dean took the stand. In the same week in  October, the Saturday Night Massacre and our yellow alert for the Yom Kippur  War. Then the Mets came from behind to take the division, pennant and almost  the Series. Tug McGraw said it best, 'Ya gotta believe.' "  </P> <P> Batchelor, and many others, believed in Pynchon after "Gravity's Rainbow."  </P> <P> But faith wasn't rewarded.  </P> <P> "I took a lot out of him. That old bugaboo about 'write what you know' -- he  made it 'write what you imagine,' " says Batchelor. "Tom Pynchon was a great  hero to me, and then he wandered off. He could have helped us. We've had a  tough time the past 17 years writing books. What is the satisfaction if you  don't have a fraternity?"  </P> <P> By not publishing any fiction for 17 years, Batchelor argues, Pynchon cut  himself off from the generation of novelists who had grown up with him.  </P> <P> Pynchon was 35 when "Gravity's Rainbow" appeared; he's 52 now.  </P> <P> "That's an enormously prolific period for any novelist. In Pynchon there's a  lot of immaturity, and he would have been able to work it out. But now, it's  like Nixon's 18-minute gap. You know what should be there, but you don't feel  it."  </P> <P> Perhaps it was Pynchon's own belief in himself that faltered. The new novel,  with its anti-yuppie bias and reference to the Ronald Reagan era, seems to have  been composed in the last few years.  </P> <P> What happened to the books he was supposedly writing in the mid-'70s, one a  novel about the Mason-Dixon line and the other involving Japanese monster  movies?  </P> <P> Batchelor's theory -- and it makes as much sense as anyone's -- is that  Pynchon, a man who has been writing at least since high school, simply got  lost. He fell too deep into the dream.  </P> <P> It's something Batchelor, after three years in the mid-'80s working on a novel  about the Russian moon program that featured exclusively Russian characters,  knows all about.  </P> <P> "I see," he says of his still-unpublished book, "that what I did was go so far  into the dream that there was nobody else with me. It's something you have to  be careful of."  </P> <P> The same thing happened with the Pynchon-Salinger fantasia. In summer, 1977,  Batchelor got a letter from Pynchon, written on Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer stationery  and containing the only public encouragement the writer has ever given to those  seeking him out: "Some of it is true, but none of the interesting parts. Keep  trying. I had never heard of your paper, and one needs news."  </P> <P> This is assuming, of course, that the letter wasn't someone's idea of a joke.  </P> <P> Batchelor says he compared it with other Pynchon signatures (there are only a  few) and it checks out. Either way, it caused him to stop believing Pynchon was  Salinger. "I was back on Planet Earth. It was 1977, and I had been to a  wonderful place, and I had been the only one there."  </P> <P> Pynchon's new novel, published by Little, Brown, is outside the dream too, in a  way that "Gravity's Rainbow" wasn't.  </P> <P> Seven hundred and sixty pages long, "Rainbow" has several hundred characters  and hardly any plot.  </P> <P> One of the most appropriate critical comments came last fall from a sophomore  at Princeton, Drayton Nabors. "It's the weirdest book I ever read," he told a  reporter after a marathon reading. "I love it. Someday I'll even finish it."  </P> <P> Readers of "Vineland" shouldn't have similar problems.  </P> <P> Batchelor, for one, is looking forward to it. "I hope," he says, "that it means  he's going to write again."  </P> <P> After the troubles with the Russian moon book, Batchelor is also publishing.  His upcoming novel, "Gordon Liddy Is My Muse," is his most accessible, one that  touches on subjects of both perennial interest (unrepentant Watergate  conspirator Liddy, Hollywood devouring writers, writers devouring other  writers) and contemporary headlines (the German problem, the Soviet problem).  </P> <P> When he thinks about Thomas Pynchon now, the image that remains is from the  slide show that Mr. and Mrs. Richard Farina Sr. gave him in their Queens home  back in 1977.  </P> <P> They were the parents of Richard Farina, the more-than-promising writer who was  killed in 1966, two days after the publication of his first novel, "Been Down  So Long It Looks Like Up to Me." The colorful Farina and the more reserved  Pynchon were best friends back at Cornell. The dedication of "Gravity's  Rainbow" reads simply: "For Richard Farina."  </P> <P> The slides were from Farina's wedding to Mimi Baez, sister of Joan, in 1963.  "They were color slides, Kodachrome," Batchelor remembers. "She was loading  them one at a time in this little tiny room. The only sound was the humming of  the fan. Seeing Pynchon, she would say, 'Oh, there's Tom! There he is, and  there's Dick.' "  </P> <P> Pynchon was this very tall, ungainly-looking young man, who was at the wedding  of his glamorous friend, Dick Farina, who was marrying into the glamorous  Baezes in a very hip California house overlooking the coast.  </P> <P> In the early '60s, you couldn't get more fashionable than this. Every leftist  cause in California centered in this home.  </P> <P> But Pynchon was just this young man, hanging around at the wedding. He had a  coat and tie on, tried to look proper, was humble and modest. He was not larger  than life, not a legend, not even a legend-to-be.  </P> <P> "It was the first time I had ever seen a picture of him," says Batchelor.  "Before that, he was so far away I couldn't glimpse him. I could feel being  there -- to be nobody in a party of very big somebodies. I could feel what it's  like being outside the hip, and wanting to know if I mattered, too. It made me  like him. I saw how you could get to 'Gravity's Rainbow' from a place like  that. You didn't have to come up with some enormous theory of genius at birth.  It was hard work, but it didn't come from nowhere."  </P></p>

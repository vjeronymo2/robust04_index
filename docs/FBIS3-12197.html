In a statement to AL-JUMHURIYAH published today,  'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur said that this outrageous massacre  shows the impossibility of coexistence between the Palestinian  Arab people and the Zionists who usurped their land.    The NPPF secretary general called on the political forces  and  parties and human rights committees in the Arab homeland and the  world to denounce and condemn this crime which the Zionist enemy  would not have dared to perpetrate without the colonialist U.S.  collusion with the Zionist enemy, and the continued U.S. support  to enable it to carry out aggressions against the Palestine  question, people, and civilization.    'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur hailed the glorious sacrifices  of the Palestinian Arab people, and expressed pride in the  righteous martyrs and victims of the criminal act which was  perpetrated by the Zionists against Palestinian worshipers at  the Ibrahimi Mosque in the blessed month of Ramadan.    He noted that the escalation of the intifadah in the  occupied  Arab territories and the Palestinian people's continued  confrontation of the colonialist Zionist schemes inside and  outside the occupied territories constitute the only way to  achieve the Palestinian people's national and inalienable  objectives, and not the capitulatory framework in which the  Zionists and colonialists have found their defeated dreams of  entrenching their occupation of Palestine.    Concluding his statement, the NPPF secretary general  stressed  the support of Iraq, the NPPF parties, and the Iraqi people,  under the leadership of President Saddam Husayn for the  Palestinian Arab people's struggle to restore their national  inalienable rights in their homeland.</p>

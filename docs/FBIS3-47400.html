			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A source of the International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA] said North Korea and the IAEA are likely to hold the  third round of their official contacts to negotiate over the  nuclear inspection issue on 13 January.    Regarding this, IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said that North  Korea had not informed the IAEA of a date for the next contact,  but he expected that they will have another contact in the  weekend, at the latest.    As the North Korean position and the inspection targets  demanded [sachal yogu hangmok] by the IAEA were clearly  expressed to each side in writing during the first and second  rounds of their contacts, they are expected to hold intensive  negotiations to narrow the differences between the two during  the third contact.</p>

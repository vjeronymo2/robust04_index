			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] La Paz, 18 Mar [date as received] (PL) -- Vice  President Albert Gore's 12-hour flash visit to Bolivia was the  subject of more expressions of rejection by the country's  leading peasant and workers organizations.    Felix Santos, top leader of the Sole Peasant Workers  Confederation of Bolivia (CSUTCB), condemned Gore's visit,  because he believes the vice president is coming to press for  the forced elimination of coca plantations and the complete  privatization of the country's economy.    There is reason to fear he is coming to promote violence  against peasants who grow coca, a leaf with natural benefits  which is also used to produce cocaine, Santos added, referring  to the growing tension between narcotics police and peasants  over the last few weeks. The peasants are afraid the soldiers  will come to flatten their crops.    Washington has conditioned its aid program of the Bolivian  balance of payment, which totals $40 million per year, to the  fulfillment of coca plantation reduction goals.    Toribio Hinojosa, secretary general of the Bolivian Workers  Federation (COB) [Central Obrera Boliviana], has said the  organization has decided to declare Al Gore's visit as non  grata, adding the visit demonstrates U.S. concern over the  peasants' determination to resist the elimination of the coca  leaf.    The government and the coca leaf growers are on the verge of  an agreement that conditions coca plantation reduction plans to  the development of alternate activities to provide farmers with  new means of survival, thus reducing tension.    During his stay in Bolivia, Gore will meet with Bolivian  President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and other national  authorities, under strict security measures.</p>

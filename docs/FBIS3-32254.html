			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>   [Text] The strike announced by the National Transportation  Coordinating Board [CNT] is starting to lead to violent  incidents promoted by angry travelers, particularly those living  in and around the capital where people have had to resort to  riding in pickups, cargo trucks, and other types of vehicles  that are not considered safe for passengers.    At the entrance to Villanueva, groups of people stoned  several buses as a way of protesting against the strike called  by the owners of intercity buses, which has left hundreds of  passengers on the streets. These people were unable to reach  their workplaces because of the lack of mass transit buses.    At the time of the attack on the buses, which were severely  damaged, several people were injured, including children who  were assisted by municipal and volunteer firemen who quickly  arrived at the scene. Policemen at the scene arrested three men  caught stoning the buses. The detainees were taken to the  National Police station in Villanueva and turned over to the  courts.    Similar incidents of violence were reported in Boca del  Monte, Villa Canales, San Miguel Petapa, and other  municipalities that were adversely affected by the  transportation strike.    We can also report that a bomb threat took place at La  Quinta  Shopping Center this morning in Zone 7 of the capital. The  offices of the CNT and other associations are located in this  shopping center, and it is believed the false bomb threat was  aimed at the bus owners who decided to go on strike starting on  1 February.    Firemen and National Police patrols arrived at the scene  where they proceeded to search the place very thoroughly without  finding anything. Normal activities at the shopping center were  suspended while the authorities conducted the search. As is  already known, the CNT, among other requests, is demanding that  the government enact an intercity bus service law, approve a law  to regulate the operation of shipping companies that operate in  the country, approve an increase in cement transportation fares,  authorize higher fuel transportation rates, and keep border  customs offices open at night.    CNT President Miguel Angel Luna said the strike currently  has  the support of 80 percent of the CNT's members. He added that  some attacks against several members of the transportation  sector have already occurred, especially in Villanueva.</p>

			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / UK Company News: All eyes on a regional success - Midland Independent Newspapers' flotation plan Midland Independent Newspapers, which publishes the Birmingham Post and Mail, is hoping to raise more than Pounds 100m in a flotation planned for March. Although no price has yet been set, the hope is that the regional newspaper group taken over in a management buy-out in 1991 will be capitalised at more than Pounds 150m. The announcement today of the flotation by way of a placing and public offer covering more than 50 per cent of the shares, will be accompanied by results for the year to December showing group turnover on continuing operations of Pounds 70.7m, up from Pounds 65.2m previously. The group will also report operating profit on continuing operations before exceptional expenses (mainly interest on the MBO finance) of Pounds 15.2m, compared with Pounds 13m. The management team of six which, led by Mr Chris Oakley, the chief executive, organised the buy-out from Ingersoll Newspapers, will share equally in 7.5 per cent of the equity. The stake could rise to 17.5 per cent, depending on performance until June 1996. The flotation will almost certainly create six new newspaper industry millionaires, at least on paper. The flotation, the first totally regional newspaper group to come to the stock exchange for a number of years, is likely to focus attention on the regional newspaper industry. Although sales of regional newspapers have been in gradual decline - total sales dropped from 17.4m in 1981 to 13.8m in 1992 - well managed companies have been increasing profit margins. Despite the recession, MIN for instance has increased operating profit margins on continuing operations from 8.9 per cent in 1991 to 21.4 per cent. All six members of the management team at Birmingham have worked in newspapers all their lives and had often felt constrained in trying out new ideas while working for other groups. 'We knew what to do to get costs down, but we also thought we knew what to do to build revenues and sales given the right policy. We were at it from the first day (of taking over),' says Mr Oakley. The group has also pursued a strategy of expansion into the East Midlands, so that it can offer advertising coverage of the entire region. Last year it acquired 20 free weeklies from Thomson regional group, ranging from Derby to Northampton. The papers had been losing Pounds 2m a year. 'We made them profitable from the week we owned them,' says Mr Oakley, who came from the Birmingham Post as editor in chief and soon after became managing director. MIN's main titles mostly lost circulation last year, but the fall was below the industry average of between 3 and 4 per cent. The Evening Mail at 205,000 was down just under 3 per cent for the year, the Birmingham Post circulation rose nearly 1 per cent to 26,000, the Sunday Mercury lost 2.5 per cent to 150,000 and the Coventry Evening Telegraph dropped just under 2 per cent to 88,000. Apart from cutting costs, setting tough advertising targets and pushing ahead with geographical expansion throughout its region, the MIN management has developed a range of new publications from What's On titles to county magazines. 'We are locking up our market place. What we are trying to do everywhere is to have a whole range of products to give advertisers a choice,' the MIN chief executive explained recently. The choice includes being able to deliver leaflets, catalogues and sometimes even products such as chocolate bars to every home in the region. James Capel, broker to the issue, which is being sponsored by Morgan Grenfell, is publishing research on the regional newspaper industry this week. It forecasts substantial profits growth in the short term as the cyclical recovery in advertising, particularly classified, gets under way. The stockbroker believes that in the longer term the sector remains attractive, despite growing competition from the electronic media, because barriers to entry are high and competition though fierce is rational. On MIN itself James Capel says the company enjoys a dominant market position in Birmingham and Coventry and 'is a good way of getting exposure to the UK regional newspaper industry.' Mr Oakley is already looking beyond the flotation and considering expansion outside the Midlands, if he can find the right acquisitions. 'We believe we could go to Swindon, or Darlington or York and produce 20 per cent-plus profit margins,' he says.</p>

			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Mayor Coleman A. Young, citing Detroit as the nation's chief victim of racist  abandonment, told the NAACP its pursuit of freedom faces challenges as strong  as when it was founded 80 years ago. Young, elected Detroit's first black mayor  in 1973, said blacks who poured into Detroit to fill the automobile plants were  "seeking jobs and freedom." Now, he said, jobs are moving out of the country  and "freedom is being undermined by the Supreme Court" and by policies of  former President Ronald Reagan. Gov. James J. Blanchard told the Detroit  convention Michigan will continue affirmative action and set-aside programs  despite adverse decisions from the high court.  </P></p>

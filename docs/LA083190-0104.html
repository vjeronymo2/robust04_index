			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> OCC COMEDY 'GOD' HAS ITS MOMENTS;  </P> <P> IT ISN'T WOODY ALLEN AT HIS BEST, BUT THE CAST KNOWS WHEN TO PLAY IT FOR  LAUGHS.  </P> <P> There's a line in Woody Allen's "God," a paraphrase of an old Hollywood maxim,  that goes like this: "Theater is for entertainment. If you want to deliver a  message, call Western Union."  </P> <P> That's Woody being glib, of course.  </P> <P> Allen, after all, has throughout most of his career been the main man of the  big-brain set, a comic who does deliver messages, along with the entertainment.  </P> <P> But that crack makes sense for "God," one of his earlier efforts apparently  designed solely for yuks. Or, when it sinks in the corn, yucks.  </P> <P> This frantic one-act isn't great Woody, but hey, even God got to rest on the  seventh day.  </P> <P> It has some moments, though, which the Orange Coast College Repertory Theatre  Company tries to take advantage of in its outdoor on-campus production.  </P> <P> The nervy, enthusiastic actors know they're hamming it up -- it's even  acknowledged in the program, where everybody thanks "The William Shatner School  of Acting" -- and the fun they have can be catching every now and then.  </P> <P> All the horseplay is pretty self-indulgent, but since the comedy lasts only  about 45 minutes and the sunny alfresco setting can be so pleasant, it's  reasonably bearable.  </P> <P> Director Eric Person keeps everything moving along, which helps, even when the  cast almost speed-reads over the lines.  </P> <P> Anyway, the plot, centering on a chaotic play within a play that features  ancient Greeks with names like Trichinosis and Hepatitis as well as appearances  by Stanley Kowalski and Blanche DuBois, welcomes a speedy, elbow-in-the-ribs  treatment.  </P> <P> 'GOD'  </P> <P> An Orange Coast College Repertory Theatre Company production of Woody Allen's  one-act comedy.

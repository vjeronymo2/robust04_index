			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> The NHL Board of Governors, meeting in Rosemont, Ill., did not reach a decision  on the proposed move of the Minnesota North Stars to the San Francisco Bay  Area, but passed an amendment to the league's bylaws that could make it easier  for any team to change cities.  </P> <P> Previously, NHL rules stipulated that a unanimous vote of the board of  governors was needed to relocate a franchise. The change would allow a team to  move with simple majority approval under certain circumstances.  </P></p>

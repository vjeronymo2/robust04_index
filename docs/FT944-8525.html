			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Firecrest to raise Pounds 1.1m from offer for subscription Firecrest Group, which has interests in advertising, sales promotion, media and leisure related businesses, is to raise Pounds 1.1m before expenses from an offer for subscription. The offer, of up to 3.67m ordinary shares at 30p, is being made by Gerrard Vivian Gray, part of Gerrard and National. The shares are dealt under Rule 4.2 and assuming full subscription, the group will have a market value of about Pounds 5.5m. No existing shareholders are selling shares. Directors forecast pre-tax profits of not less than Pounds 402,000 for 1994 and consider that not less than Pounds 917,000 can be achieved in 1995. Mr Roy Capper, chairman, pointed out that the profit projections took no account of any positive or negative revenue from the proposed launch of 'Collect'. This project is due to be launched in 1995 and is based on a smartcard points-based loyalty system, which has been developed in partnership with a large media group. The latest date for receipt of applications is December 9.</p>

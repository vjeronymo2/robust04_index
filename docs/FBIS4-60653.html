			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Salih Abu-Bakr Bin-Husaynun, </F> Yemeni Socialist Party Central Committee member, in London, by  Bashir al-Bakr, in Paris, on 15 May]    [Text] [Al-Bakr] It seems that the military battle's direct  objective of occupying Aden has failed. Do you believe the  battle will continue and what are its objectives?    [Bin-Husaynun] The direct objective of the battle has  actually been foiled after one week of fighting thanks to our  forces' steadfastness. Today, the 15th of May, the forces of  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih who ignited the war are in a difficult  position. All their supply lines are being cut from the rear.  These forces will be besieged and will be forced to either  surrender, or be destroyed.    'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's dream of occupying Aden and the  southern and eastern governorates are sick dreams. He knows  more than anyone else that this will not take place during his  time, and that the logic of annexation and occupation is  rejected even if this will cost us our lives. The question is  not confined to within the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] but is a  general popular feeling. The people are ready for sacrifices to  shake off hegemony and despotism and to defend their interests.    The battles show that his forces which tried to reach Aden  have been routed. The forces are now intermingling in the  [former] border areas. Salih's forces are now in a position  that is not to be envied. He and the military from the  Al-Ahmar family are fully responsible for the military and  civilian casualties because they were the ones to launch a war  on the Yemeni people on 4 May. The people will not forgive this  gang and it will be taken to account sooner or later.    [Al-Bakr] But the communiques Sanaa continues to issue still  speak about military victories and about trying the YSP leaders.  What do you have to say to this?    [Bin-Husaynun] As the military offensive has failed in  attaining its objectives, the psychological war and the military  communiques will also not serve the operations room that runs  the war. If we review the military communiques issued over one  week and the statements made by the civilian generals like  Basindwah and al-Iryani, we find that they have captured Aden  more than 20 times.    I will reveal a secret. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and the gang  that launched the war are preparing to escape from Yemen.  However, we will not permit them to do so. He will have to pay  for what he has committed. We will stalk him wherever he goes.    [Al-Bakr] Does this mean you are preparing to enter Sanaa?    [Bin-Husaynun] Sanaa is a must even if the journey is a long  one because it is the capital of Yemen and cannot be given up.    [Al-Bakr] And do you view this as a victory if it takes  place? What is the use of entering Sanaa? The president says  that his objective is to enter Aden and you answer him with the  same logic while the war destroys the country's economy and  kills people?    [Bin-Husaynun] We do not claim victories. From the first day  of the war that was launched on us, we said we will exercise  positive self-defense. What can we do when we find ourselves  facing a bloodthirsty suicidal gang? The only solution is to  eradicate this gang which obstructs development, prevents  stability, and makes the people go backward. This war was  imposed on us and on all the good forces. That's why  confrontation is inevitable. We have to admit that the people  pay a prohibitive price for this, but what can we do?    [Al-Bakr] You toured the United Arab Emirates [UAE],  Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. What was the objective  of this tour? What are the positions of the Arab leaders whom  you met on the ongoing war in Yemen?    [Bin-Husaynun] We met with [UAE President] His Highness  Shaykh Zayid, who cares for Yemeni unity, and with His  Excellency President Husni Mubarak, who, along with us, worked  to prevent the war option. We also met with His Excellency  President Hafiz al-Asad, who is known for his unionist  positions, and with His Majesty King Husayn, who sponsored the  signing of the document of pledge and accord, and also with His  Majesty King Fahd, a neighbor and a brother who cares for  sparing Yemeni blood.    We briefed the brothers on the ongoing unfair war which is  spilling Yemeni blood and threatening Yemen's unity and  stability. We also conveyed messages from brother 'Ali Salim  al-Bid, deputy chairman of the Presidential Council and  secretary general of the YSP. These messages cautioned against  the serious regrettable events planned and carried out by 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih and the military clique of the al-Ahmar family.  We also carried an initiative by the brother secretary general  to spare blood. We sensed both a response and care for sparing  blood, for halting the destructive war, and for safeguarding  Yemen's unity and people.    [Al-Bakr] What are the points of the initiative you carried  to the Arab leaders?    [Bin-Husaynun] In brief, the initiative calls for an  immediate cease-fire and the return to the negotiating table in  order to resolve all problems. Our Arab brothers promised us to  provide everything needed to stop the bleeding and help the  Yemeni people circumvent their ordeal. We now express the YSP  leadership's satisfaction with this attitude and these genuine  and responsible positions.    [Al-Bakr] It is noted that you were received at the highest  level. Does this mean the Arab brothers do not recognize the  decisions made by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, which ousted  you from the government?    [Bin-Husaynun] You may come to this conclusion. I would  like to point out that all Arab leaders, whom we met, felt that  there is a real crisis which cannot be summed up in such terms  as legitimacy and outlaws, terms which Salih used as the themes  of his war. The Arab leaders believe that dialogue is necessary  and that the decisions made should be canceled, so the two sides  could resolve the problem.    I would like to pose a question to 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih: If  the southern leaders are secessionists and outlaws, then with  whom was the unity achieved? Is unity not concluded between two  parties? Moreover, what is meant by legitimacy? Does legitimacy  mean the legitimate cancellation of one party in favor of  another party?    [Al-Bakr] What is your comment on a statement made by  [Yemeni Planning and Development Minister] Dr. al-Iryani that  the north would continue the war to finish off the YSP, even if  it takes 100 years to do so?    [Bin-Husaynun] If he can do so, let him do it. However, I  would like to tell al-Iryani that our ability is twice his  ability and we will defend our ideas, principles, and the Yemeni  people in the south and north for 200 years.    Furthermore, I would like to blame al-Iryani because we  wanted him in the ranks of modernization and peace in view of  his known high culture. We, however, find al-Iryani today  wearing a military suit and making conflicting and shaky  statements.    [Al-Bakr] Has oil been affected by the war?    [Bin-Husaynun] The oil installations have not yet been  affected by the military operations, and the oil production and  exportation are continuing as before in the oil fields of  Ma'rib, Shabwah, and Hadhramaut. However, the exploration and  survey operations came to a halt, and a large number of experts  departed.    [Al-Bakr] If we assume that fighting stopped today and that  you returned to dialogue, what project would you propose? Would  you continue the unity or search for a new formula?    [Bin-Husaynun] Our direct objective is a cease-fire. This  would facilitate the search for appropriate options. We demand  an unconditional cease-fire and a return to dialogue. When we  made an initiative in this regard we were careful and governed  by a sense of responsibility toward our people. We did not make  this initiative out of fear or weakness.    [Al-Bakr] Thus, the opportunity for dialogue with President  Salih still exists, despite everything?    [Bin-Husaynun] Dialogue is necessary, whether with Salih or  others. This is because Yemen does not lack the forces of good  will.</p>

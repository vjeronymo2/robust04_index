			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Qualified, but little hope of a job: The consumer Pat Smith, an art and design teacher from Mansfield, Nottinghamshire. 'I think everybody is frightened. I am very worried about the future and my job prospects. I have just qualified as a teacher but I can't get a job. In my field there just haven't been many openings nationwide. 'Before I went to university, I did some keyboarding, so now I am temping. It's pretty menial work. I haven't been spending at all recently. The last big purchase I bought was my coat. 'I am most definitely spending less this Christmas, but luckily I have relatives who are not very materialistic - they won't be presenting me with a list of things I can't afford. 'For the sake of everybody else, not so much for me, I would like to see the government building things up again, going back and starting again. More money needs to be spent on the fundamentals, on education and housing. 'My own biggest worry is not having somewhere nice to live. I'm living with my parents at the moment, which is not a good idea, but there is absolutely no way I can think far enough ahead to buying my own flat, let alone other big purchases. 'I am trying to save, but it is not very easy. Right now I only think of getting myself more qualifications.'</p>

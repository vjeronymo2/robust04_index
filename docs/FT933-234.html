			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Short time for steel: Japanese steelmen to be asked to stay away JAPAN'S leading steelmakers are expected to ask workers to stay at home for two to three extra days per month to cut costs, in a move likely to set a standard for other troubled industries. Nippon Steel, Kawasaki Steel and NKK, three of the largest makers, confirmed yesterday they were considering the reduction in work hours, which would be subsidised to a maximum of Y9,410 (Dollars 89.60) per day by the Japanese government. Manufacturers are looking for new ways to reduce labour costs, which rose last year for all industries by an average of 5.8 per cent, even though sales for most products fell as the economic downturn worsened. The tradition of lifetime employment in Japan means companies have tried to find ways to reduce costs other than laying off workers. Most have already cut their graduate intake and plan to trim workforces through natural wastage. But Japan's economy is continuing to weaken and manufacturers are likely to follow the steel industry's lead. The Labour Ministry has approved steel industry subsidies for 'employment adjustment', meaning retraining or just keeping workers at home. The steelmakers will need approval from company unions, which may also be asked to accept pay cuts in the longer term. A senior official said manufacturers and unions would come under government pressure to accept a pay cut. Six years ago Japanese steelmakers cut working hours, as the industry was hit by yen appreciation and declining domestic sales, but the rapid growth of the late 1980s encouraged companies to hire workers to meet demand. The companies have just announced profit revisions, with Nippon Steel, the world's largest maker, expecting a Y15bn pre-tax loss in the year ending in March.

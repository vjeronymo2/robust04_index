			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUESTIONING 'FAITH'  </P> <P> The correct term for the plight of the runaways in Livingston, Mont., is  spiritual abuse. Unfortunately, Americans have so little language for spiritual  realities other than that provided by institutional religions that spiritual  abuse goes unrecognized not only in this extreme case but in millions of  American homes.  </P> <P> If it were adults who were being forced into the spiritual practices described,  it would be grounds for revolution. But because they are young adults, they  forfeit our collective protection. Perhaps some good can come from this if test  cases do result, and the pain of spiritual abuse for children is exposed and  made conscious. At the very least, the state must stop enforcing the obedience  of children to parents who are spiritually violating them.  </P> <P> DIANA QUINN ROSE, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE GLEN HAS JUST ENOUGH  </P> <P> Daren Wilkinson used to think a lot about what he had to do this year.  </P> <P> Everybody was wondering, asking, whispering. Could this guy really become  Orange Glen's starting quarterback and successfully replace Cree Morris, who  led California in passing last season?  </P> <P> Well, the answer is yes, but not in quite the same spectacular fashion as  Morris. Take Orange Glen's 7-6 victory Friday night over host Poway in front of  about 1,500. Wilkinson finished 10 for 12 passing for 110 yards. But the trick  for Orange Glen was a balanced effort, both offensively and defensively.  </P> <P> There was Ryan Strathearn, Orange Glen's powerful fullback, who carried 29  times for 116 yards.  </P> <P> And there was Orange Glen's defense, which stood tall with less than five  minutes remaining. Poway linebacker Chris Rzewuski had just recovered a fumble  to give his team first and 10 at the Orange Glen 34. Three plays later, Poway  had only advanced to the 31. Greg Brown's 48-yard field-goal attempt was short,  and Strathearn's running carried Orange Glen the rest of the way.  </P> <P> So Wilkinson has a little help. And he doesn't worry about comparisons with  Morris. What's past is past.  </P> <P> "During the beginning of the year, it was tough," Wilkinson said. "Everybody  was wondering if I could fill Cree Morris' shoes."  </P> <P> Of course, he wouldn't mind getting a few more opportunities to pass.  </P> <P> "At first, I didn't like (the balanced offense)," he said. "But I have to  accept it because we're getting victories with it."  </P> <P> Orange Glen is 4-1, 2-0 in Palomar League play. Poway is 3-2, 1-1.  </P> <P> Orange Glen's defense has allowed just 41 points in five games. A typically  alert play came early in the fourth quarter when Poway appeared to be on its  way to scoring. On third and nine from Orange Glen's 45, Poway quarterback Tom  Fischer threw for Aaron Kelly, but defensive back Gabriel Munoz dove to tip it  away.  </P> <P> "The defense won the game for us," Orange Glen Coach Rob Gilster said. "They've  been playing good all year long."  </P> <P> Orange Glen's scoring drive was as smooth as they come. It happened on the  first possession and covered 80 yards in 12 plays. First, Strathearn did his  thing, running through small gaps in the line and then running over an  assortment of tacklers. He had the ball in his hands on the first six plays of  the drive, running five times for 22 yards and catching a seven-yard pass from  Wilkinson.  </P> <P> Wilkinson passed for 11 yards to Noel Toloumu and 14 to Ryan Gustine to keep  the drive moving before Toloumu went nine yards for the touchdown.  </P> <P> Poway wasted little time retaliating. Fischer found a play that worked -- a  keeper around left end-and used it several times successfully until running  back Chris Quiseng went off tackle to the right side to score on third and six  from the Orange Glen 13 with 30 seconds left in the quarter. A bad snap  prevented the extra point, which proved the difference in what turned into a  defensive game.  </P></p>

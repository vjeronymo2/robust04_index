			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Boeing was about to warn on older 747s before El Al crash BOEING was about to warn all airlines operating older versions of the 747 jumbo jet to inspect engine fixtures just before the El Al 747 cargo aircraft crashed in Amsterdam on Sunday after losing two engines. The US manufacturer yesterday said airline customers had been notified before the Amsterdam disaster that an inspection request was pending. The issue was also discussed at a meeting of 747 operators called by Boeing last month. But formal notification asking airlines to inspect the fuse pins connecting the engine struts to the wings was only sent on Monday night, after the Amsterdam crash, to the 69 operators of 747-100, 747-200 and 747-300 jets powered with Pratt &amp; Whitney or Rolls-Royce engines. The El Al aircraft was a 747-200 with Pratt &amp; Whitney engines. Last night, rescue workers had recovered 15 bodies from the rubble of two adjoining apartment blocks hit by the aircraft on Sunday. The official estimate of the number of people killed is more than 250. Civil aviation officials said it was too early to speculate on precise causes of the crash. They said it was unclear whether the crash was caused by an uncontained explosion in one engine which damaged the second or whether a structural failure occurred in the engine mounting. The aircraft's flight recorder has not been found. Last night, a Boeing investigator said it could have been destroyed or 'rendered unusable' by the intense heat generated by the crash. Airlines yesterday began checking pins on more than 500 older 747 aircraft. The pins are designed to enable an engine to break away from the wing in the event of a failure. Boeing, the world's biggest airliner manufacturer with about 60 per cent of the world commercial airliner market, stressed that its formal request for inspection was a 'precautionary measure'. It added that the causes of the El Al crash and a similar accident of a China Airlines 747 cargo aircraft in Taiwan last year were still unknown. It added that there was 'no evidence' that the pins, which measure 4 inches by 2 1/4 inches, were implicated in either the Amsterdam or the Taiwan disasters.</p>

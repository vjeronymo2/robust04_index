			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / International Company News: CBS reported to be offering deep discounts CBS, the loss-making US television network, is believed to be offering deep discounts to US advertisers in an effort to fill advertising slots for the winter Olympic games, which begin next weekend in Albertville, France. Mr George Schweitzer, senior vice-president of marketing, said he would not comment on pricing policies, nor on a report in Advertising Age, the US trade publication, that yesterday quoted buyers who estimated that CBS was offering prime time advertising slots for as much as 40 per cent below normal Olympic rates. Some prime-time slots that originally sold for Dollars 250,000 were being offered for as low as Dollars 150,000, according to Advertising Age. Mr Schweitzer said he expected all of CBS's slots for the Olympics to be sold shortly. Over the past year, CBS has had a string of problems related to its sports coverage. The network wrote off Dollars 282m last year because of losses on its baseball and other sports coverage. In the third quarter of 1991, CBS wrote off Dollars 322m pre-tax on its baseball and football contracts, resulting in a Dollars 169.1m loss. Ms Jessica Reif, an analyst at Oppenheimer, yesterday termed the network's sports strategy 'pathetic' and said CBS had seriously overpaid for both the baseball and Olympic US television rights. CBS paid Dollars 243m for the winter Olympic rights.</p>

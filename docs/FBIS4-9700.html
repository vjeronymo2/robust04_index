			<p>CSO     [Text] In an effort to save the policemen who patrol the  neighborhoods, blocks, and villages, the National Police  yesterday officially launched the Community Participation  Program, which is essentially designed to integrate the  community and the police.    The plan was announced by General Carlos Alberto Pulido  Barrantes, director of community participation, at a press  conference, where he explained the scope of the official  strategy for improving the police's image.    The official indicated that one of the most important  aspects  of the program is the selection of the personnel who will serve  as patrol officers and whose job will be to interact with the  community in their assigned areas.    The patrol officers will be selected very carefully,  according to the police plan, to make sure that only qualified,  well-mannered people with a strong civic spirit are chosen.    "We will no longer take people," said Pulido, "who have  nothing to do, who have been rejected elsewhere. The selection  process will involve background checks, and the best high school  graduates from each community will be identified."    For now, the police academies will train the first 400  patrol  officers, who will begin working in the underprivileged  districts to determine the needs of these communities.    The program requires that the activities of the patrol  officers will be monitored constantly to make sure they adjust  to the needs that arise in the districts where they are working.    "The police," said General Pulido, "are willing to do  whatever is necessary to reach out to each citizen. The police  officer will get to know the people on his beat and will offer  them service and friendship."    The general explained, however, that this will not be an  easy  task, since "we need more men," but he said that if the  population cooperates with the program, it will become stronger  and there will be participation.    In this regard, the patrol officers assigned to the program  will participate in police campaigns to encourage courtesy and  proper treatment to project a new image in the community.    The strategy is designed "to respond to people with our  efforts," stated General Pulido, "helping people solve their  problems, entertaining children, and showing support for the  community as it deals with its problems."    Under the plan, in each village, municipality, and  neighborhood in the country there will be a community  participation office, a clearinghouse for complaints and claims,  an information office, and a help line that will allow the  people to voice their concerns.  <H5>  All for One </H5>   To further the objectives of the program, the police will  launch a campaign to involve patrol officers in disaster  prevention, ecological projects, rescue operations, drug  addiction prevention, literacy, and child protection.    In addition, the officers will be trained to work with the  community on projects to build schools, rest homes, sports  centers, housing, and the reconstruction of parks, roads, and  sewage systems.    On another front, the police want to strengthen the Civic  Police Force to contribute to the development of educational  efforts to raise people's awareness of basic rules of safety and  courtesy.    "We want the service to be as pure and transparent as  possible, to make our work visible and get trade unions,  industrial plants, Indians, black people's associations,  universities, women's groups, and other social groups involved  in our work," stated Salgado.    The high-ranking official also stated that as the patrol  officers work in their respective communities, people's trust in  that institution will be renewed.</p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Karlsruhe's sound ruling POSSIBLY THE most remarkable feature of the European Community's Maastricht treaty is the profusion of contradictory opinions it inspires among both backers and detractors. The plan at the centre of the treaty, for economic and monetary union by the end of the century, was once vilified by a British cabinet minister as 'a German racket designed to take over the whole of Europe'. Yet the same plan is opposed by a majority of the German electorate, according to opinion polls, on the opposing grounds that it represents a ploy by Germany's EC partners to take over the D-Mark. Yesterday's approval of the treaty by the Karlsruhe constitutional court clears the way for Germany to become the final EC state to ratify Maastricht. Since Germany is not only the EC's largest member, but also possesses its hardest currency, any worthwhile form of Emu cannot take place without its participation. The main uncertainty amid the many ambiguities of the Maastricht process - whether Emu will take place at the end of the 1990s, or at all - has, as expected, not been resolved. The court made clear that Emu's original 'irreversibility' - a notion to which Chancellor Helmut Kohl himself at one stage gave some support - is no longer credible. 'With ratification of the (European) union treaty, Germany is not subordinating itself to an unclear and automatic mechanism towards currency union which it cannot steer,' the court said yesterday. Since hopes that Emu could take place according to the Maastricht timetable had already been set back by recession and currency unrest, this ruling, however, was little more than a juridical statement of the obvious. Democratic principles Considerably more important - and greatly to be welcomed - is the court's clarification of the procedures under which Germany would transfer to planned supranational institutions some elements of decision-making which at present are held nationally. These procedures relate in particular to the extension to the proposed European central bank of the monetary powers wielded by the Bundesbank. Such a shift, the court ruled, could be made only under conditions which conform to the democratic principles of the German constitution, under which state power is held to emanate from the German people. The German parliament has already made clear during ratification that, before the D-Mark could be subsumed into a single currency, it would closely vet the conditions. This examination, it now appears, will relate not simply to the ability of Emu applicants to meet the Maastricht economic performance criteria, laying down which states should make the first move towards a single currency. More widely, parliament will be under the obligation to ensure that European integration meets standards of legislative transparency and accountability which the German people legitimately require to be upheld. Focus of discord How these safeguards will be maintained remains unclear. The proposed participation in European law-making of the Bundesrat, which represents the interest of the German Lander, could become a focus of discord with Germany's EC partners. Mr Kohl has long urged increased powers for the European parliament as part of his original demand - rejected at the 1991 Maastricht summit - for monetary union to take place in step with the much more vague concept of political union. Although yesterday's ruling rejected any formal linkage between monetary and political union, the issue of giving the Strasbourg parliament more muscle will remain firmly on the German government's agenda. The main message from Karlsruhe is that the process of European integration will suffer further setbacks unless it retains the consent and consensus of European electorates. The unpopularity of the Maastricht treaty displayed in opinion polls and referendums around the continent during the last 18 months illustrates how this consensus has been in short supply. By reminding the Community of the need for democratic and constitutional checks along the route to European union, the Karlsruhe court has not made the path any easier. But it has given politicians strong and wise guidance on how eventually to reach the destination.</p>

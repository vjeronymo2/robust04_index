			<p>CSO     [Text] Medellin -- Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela and Jose  Santacruz Londono, presumed "capos" of the Cali Cartel, have  three court days to appear for questioning before the Office of  the Regional Prosecutor of Antioquia. This action is connected  with the investigation of the explosion of a car bomb in front  of the Monaco Building, owned by the late Pablo Escobar Gaviria.    Through a citation order posted at 0800 yesterday, in the  prosecutors' common secretariat, the Prosecutor's Office  summoned Rodriguez and Santacruz to submit to questioning as  presumed intellectual perpetrators of the car bomb. Its  explosion occurred at dawn on 13 January 1988, in front of the  building in which the "capo" was residing with his family.    The citation order was posted in Medellin, Cali, and  Mariquita, and its terms will run from the time that the  document is posted in the two latter cities. According to  official spokesmen, if, within the next three days, the pair  accused of this terrorist act fail to appear for questioning,  implementing their submission to justice, the process will  follow its normal course and court-appointed attorneys will be  named.    Killed in the attack on the Monaco Building were Miguel  Angel  Espinoza and Javier de Jesus Tamayo Perez, guards of the  property. After the explosion, the authorities discovered inside  the building a valuable art collection containing such works as  paintings by Botero, Dali, Grau, Obregon, and Dario Morales. It  also included one of the seven copies of Rodin's "The Thinker"  existing in the world, Chinese vases of the Ming Dynasty, and  pre-Columbian works.    Moreover, they found in the Monaco Building's basement eight  antique vehicles, a collection of motorcycles, and a completely  armored Mercedes-Benz limousine.    The explosion destroyed three nearby houses and seriously  damaged several adjacent buildings, causing losses in the  millions.    Furthermore, yesterday the authorities extended the  questioning in the Antioquia Regional Prosecutor's Office of  Valentin de Jesus Taborda, one of Pablo Escobar's aides,  arrested in Itagui, and Luis Eduardo Fernandez Bedoya, alias  "Lucho," ringleader of the people's militias in Valle de Aburra.</p>

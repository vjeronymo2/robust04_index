			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata will meet U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor on Friday  in Marrakech, Morocco, where they are attending a ministerial  meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT),  government sources said Tuesday. Hata and Kantor will meet for  about two hours over breakfast to seek a breakthrough in  resuming the failed trade "framework" talks and also discuss  multilateral issues, the sources said.    Relations between Tokyo and Washington have soured over  trade  following the collapse of the trade negotiations in February  when Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill  Clinton met.    Hata's trip to Marrakech will formally be decided in a  buck-slip cabinet meeting Wednesday morning, they said.    The foreign minister is to leave Japan on Wednesday noon for  Morocco and return to Japan on Sunday, according to the sources.  Hata was originally scheduled to leave Tuesday but was delayed  due to the political turmoil following Hosokawa's sudden  announcement last Friday that he will resign .    Hata, also deputy prime minister, is tipped as a strong  candidate as the successor to Hosokawa.    On Monday, the Japanese Government sent Nobuo Matsunaga, the  government representative for external economic affairs, to  Marrakech in case Hata cannot attend the four-day GATT session  that wraps up Friday.    Also in Marrakech, Hata will meet Australian Trade Minister  Bob Mcmullan and Leon Brittan, the European Union's trade  commissioner, separately Thursday, the sources said.    Hata may also meet U.S. Vice President Al Gore if possible,  the sources said.</p>

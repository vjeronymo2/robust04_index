			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin stressed  that it is not yet necessary to use monetary measures to curb  inflation because the Bank of Thailand is still able to ensure  the inflation rate does not exceed 4.5 per cent this year.    In an interview with THE NATION, Tharin responded to an  International Monetary Fund (IMF) suggestion urging the Thai  government to cautiously deal with possible high inflation.  Tharin said that the Bank of Thailand is still able to "fine  tune" the economy. Moreover, the Finance Ministry has  maintained discipline in government's spending, he said.    He said that he got an assurance from the Bank of Thailand  that the inflation rate would not exceed 4.5 per cent by the end  of this year. Although the inflation rate in the first quarter  was 4.8 per cent, Tharin said that the rate increased by only  3.7 per cent over the past 12 months. In the first quarter of  1993, the inflation rate rose by 3.3 percent over the previous  year.    Tharin attributed the 5 percent inflation rate in January to  the rise in farm prices. The central bank has already informed  him that farm prices will be soon reduced, he noted.    "The IMF suggestion came as result of the brief observation  from two or three IMF staffers who visited Thailand only for a  few days. At any rate, the Finance Ministry and the Bank of  Thailand have been particularly aware of the inflation rate," he  said.    Tharin said that the inflation was largely caused by  inadequate good supply, not the government's excessive  expenditure. "I still believe Thailand will be able to control  the inflation rate at 4.5 per cent, while the real economic  growth rate should be 8 per cent on an annual basis," he said.  Tharin added that he expects the private sector will  participate more in the investment sector in the near future.    "My prime concern, instead, is slower growth in domestic  savings," Tharin said. He said that he has assigned the Bank of  Thailand to find out the cause of the marginal growth in  domestic savings; whether money was transferred to other types  of investment such as mutual funds and has not been brought back  into the system.    Tharin stressed that the Finance Ministry will keep the  government's expenditure below Bt[baht]715 billion in 1995.  Although the government has to spend Bt32 billion on a salary  rise for civil servants, Tharin said the pay rise is unlikely to  cause inflation problems. [passage omitted]</p>

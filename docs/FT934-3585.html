			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Delors to oppose labour deregulation Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, will tell European Union leaders at their summit starting on Friday that cutting wages and wholesale labour market deregulation are not the ways to beat the jobs crisis and strengthen Europe's competitiveness. Cutting wages and pruning welfare payments to price Europe's unemployed into jobs would be 'socially unacceptable and politically untenable', and would 'only worsen the crisis by depressing domestic demand', according to the Commission white paper on growth and jobs. This strategy document, circulated yesterday to member governments, is intended to be the centrepiece of the summit. The Commission's approach contrasted sharply with the call yesterday from Unice, the EU employers' confederation, for a comprehensive reduction in labour costs and the privatisation of welfare systems. Unice's report, Making Europe more Competitive, is timed to gain employers a prominent voice in the summit debate. The report wants: To reduce Europe's high non-wage labour costs, especially social security contributions for the low-paid and young workers. Real wage increases to be kept below rises in productivity. Higher wage differentials, especially by cutting minimum wages and marginal tax rates. The Euro-employers also want relaxation of rules on working hours, easier hire-and-fire laws, lower unemployment benefit and more limited access to the social security system. Unice also wants a general roll-back of the public sector and a review of EU legislation with a view to scrapping regulation which implies costs for industry. The central employment section of the white paper emphasises lifelong training, lifting non-wage costs off low-skilled work, job-sharing and more part-time work within companies rather than as a national scheme. It envisages a push to develop services for work-seekers. 'Unemployment benefits can only be reduced so far before the poverty line is reached,' the white paper says, adding: 'These limits have already been reached in several countries.' A senior EC official called the approach 'readjusting regulation to fit the present situation'. EU urged to catch up, Page 2</p>

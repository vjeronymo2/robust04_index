			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Malta (7): Could 0.03% impose veto? - European Union application If membership of the European Union were solely a question of European pedigree, then Malta would have few problems in joining. Possessing some of the first significant traces of civilisation from megalithic times and the Norman conquest, Malta has ample European credentials, including the Knights of Malta's valiant defence against the Turks and the islands' heroic role in the second world war. But this is not enough to ensure an easy passage for Malta as a full member of the EU. The Maltese application is caught up in circumstances largely beyond the islands' - and the Nationalist government's - control. Through the avis of last October, Brussels accepted Malta's 'indisputable European calling', and talked of the need to send a 'positive signal' to encourage the islands to meet the required criteria for an open market economy. The avis envisages no real difficulty for the EU budget. Malta would be a net beneficiary receiving some Ecu60-70m in structural funds and paying in up to Ecu30m a year. But the avis is cautious about timing. Some of Malta's long-standing allies including Britain have warned that the application will depend on institutional reform of the EU and the outcome of enlargement discussions with Austria and the Nordic countries. The application is likely to move slowly - even if negotiations begin this year. The current Greek presidency of the EU will seek to push matters forward because they see Malta's application linked to that of Cyprus (the Greek side), and the Greeks are anxious that the latter's application should prosper. Both pose similar problems as small islands with limited populations, though in the case of Cyprus there is the complicating factor of the Turkish presence. The main difficulty that Malta must overcome is the resistance of EU members to extending the current principle of the veto in voting to such small entities. (Malta's GNP is 0.03 per cent of the EU). The Maltese claim a concession on size has already been made in the case of tiny Luxembourg. But of course the Maltese recognise its membership circumstances are different; and the citing of Luxembourg is a form of short-hand for insisting that a way can be found to admit them. The Nationalist party has been consistently pro-European, in contrast to the Labour party which was responsible for nailing Malta's colours to positive neutrality and the non-aligned movement. Indeed, the amendments in 1987 to the constitution enshrined Malta's neutrality and the policy of non-alignment. Perversely, this occurred at a moment when the concept of non-alignment was fast losing its rationale with the end of the cold war and the collapse of super-power rivalry. The present government is now willing to subscribe to the common foreign and security policy of the EU. Nevertheless, this will not be easily done without amending the constitution. This would require a three-quarters majority in parliament. And if the constitution is not amended at least notionally this would be incompatible with article five of the Maastricht Treaty. Malta's existing relations with the EU are governed by an association agreement which came into force in 1971 as a result of a Nationalist party initiative. However, the agreement was never more than partially implemented, having been stalled by the 1971-87 period of Labour party power. It was left to the Nationalists in 1990 to apply for full membership against the backdrop of a Labour party less implacably opposed to a deal with Brussels. Given the hostility of the Labour party to integration with Europe, the Nationalists had to start virtually from scratch to align economic policy and trading practices. The degree of change required was underlined by the avis: 'The reforms which imply Malta's adoption of the acquis communautaire affect so many different areas (tax, finance, movement of capital, trade protection, competition law, etc) and require so many changes in traditional patterns of behaviour that what is effectively involved is a root-and-branch overhaul of the entire regulatory and operational framework of the Maltese economy.' The avis then adds: 'These reforms are nevertheless indispensable, not only to spare Malta a transition period that would be so drawn out as to be tantamount to constituting 'special membership' of the Community; but above all to enable its economy to take advantage of all the opportunities provided by accession.' On the fiscal side, draft legislation has been drawn up for the introduction of value added tax in 1995. Until now governments have depended heavily on duties on imported goods; and when customs duties and import levies are both taken into account, the rates of protection are extremely high, on occasions being 100 per cent. The introduction of VAT and the gradual elimination of import levies will encourage the transition to a fully liberalised market. The government is pledged to do this, regardless of what happens to accession negotiations. As part of developing a financial centre, the government is committed to introduce financial and tax legislation that will be in harmony with the EU this year. More complex will be the position of Maltese industry which has enjoyed a high degree of protection. The islands' electronics businesses stand to benefit from an opening up of the EU market since their rationale is export-oriented. But the small companies involved in such activities as construction and furniture making, which account for 70 per cent of industrial employment, hide behind stringent tariff and non-tariff barriers. The sensitive shipbuilding/repairing sector, which provides almost 5 per cent of total employment and a central part of Malta's historic calling in the Mediterranean, is heavily subsidised. To meet competition rules, shipbuilding would require substantial restructuring  - something which the government has already initiated, but it is still at an early phase. On the institutional side, the avis notes that Malta through the official use of English would be able to avoid the introduction of another EU language. This is clearly a plus. Against this, it highlights the limited number of senior public officials with sufficient international experience to 'play a full part in the decision-making processes of the Community institutions'. (Malta's diplomatic corps mans some 15 embassies and consulates worldwide). Brussels' message to Malta is that these difficulties are not insurmountable. Between now and the inter-governmental conference in 1996 when the issue of enlargement is to be addressed, substantive negotiations are unlikely. Nevertheless, the Maltese can help their case by demonstrating their determination to align themselves with the broad criteria for accession. This is being done, even in some of the less expected areas. The government seems to have taken to heart criticisms in the avis directed against 'unsustainable bird hunting' practices. The authorities last month clamped down on the Maltese habit of firing at anything and everything, including rare birds of prey. This led to furious protests from the hunting community, who have carried out a series of spray-can attacks on signposts and the walls of public buildings.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] In Yemen, the civil war is raging and there is  extremely violent fighting at this very moment between  government troops and rebel forces, the northerners and the  southerners, near Aden. [passage omitted]    Here is an exclusive interview with Admiral Jean-Luc  Delaunay, a top officer in the French Navy in the Indian Ocean.  He spoke to Fabrice Le Quintrec from the ship Le Var:    [Begin recording] [Delaunay] We evacuated 300 people from  Aden today and 200 people from Al Mukalla, a small port 500 km  from Aden, including a group of French tourists. We have four  ships taking part in the operation: A repair ship, an oil  tanker, a landing craft, and a dispatch boat, which we have  brought from the Persian Gulf. All this is taking place without  any panic because the harbor authorities in the aforementioned  ports are making things easy for us. Meanwhile, the French Army  evacuated about 250 people from Sanaa, whom they sent to  Djibouti.    [Le Quintrec] Admiral, how many French or foreign nationals  remain to be evacuated from Yemen?    [Delaunay] We believe that there are very few French  nationals and European nationals in Aden. We believe that there  are about 30 French nationals, whom we will evacuate tomorrow  morning.    [Le Quintrec] Are you going to stay in the area for a long  time?    [Delaunay] No, it will mainly depend on the number of French  nationals. If we manage to evacuate these last French nationals  tomorrow -- and only the French consul in Aden will be able to  tell us -- there is no reason why we should prolong our stay  beyond then since we will have accomplished our mission.

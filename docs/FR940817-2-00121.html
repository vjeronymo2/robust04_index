The purpose of the proposed refuge is to protect, enhance, and manage a valuable wetland area known as the Big Branch Marsh, which is threatened by urban expansion from the city of New Orleans. A Draft Environmental Assessment and Land Protection Plan for the proposed refuge has been developed by Service biologists in coordination with the State of Louisiana, the Northshore Coast Watch, the Coalition to Restore Louisiana, the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation, the St. Tammany Sportsmen's League, and the St. Tammany Police Jury. The assessment considers the biological, environmental, and socioeconomic effects of establishing the refuge. The assessment also evaluates three alternative actions and their potential impacts on the environment. Written comments or recommendations concerning the proposal are welcomed and should be sent to the address below. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Land acquisition planning for the project is currently underway.

It is bordered by Cane Bayou on the west, Lake Pontchartrain on the south, and the Southern Railway trestle on the east. The northern boundary runs along several parish roads and bayous which separate the marsh from residential development south of U.S. Highway 190, an east-west highway that runs from Slidell to Mandeville, Louisiana. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rufuge would consist of up to 12,000 acres of land acquired in fee title from willing sellers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The major wildlife values are the numerous species of shorebirds, wading birds, neotropical migratory birds, and wintering watefowl. Raptors include the osprey, northern harrier, peregrine falcon, and bald eagle. White-tailed deer, mink, raccoon, and river otter are among the many species of mammals dependent on the area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The entire area serves as an important nursery for fish, shrimp, and crabs and represents one of the better fish production areas on Lake Pontchartrain. The estuaries, ponds, and bayous provide a diverse mix of brackish and freshwater habitats for many species of saltwater and freshwater fish of both recreational and commercial importance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: August 2, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> James W.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has stated that steps  are being taken toward a new Middle East -- politically,  economically, and socially -- and added that Turkey will  continue to contribute in that direction. Cetin departed for  Egypt to participate as an observer in the Gaza-Jericho  agreement signing ceremony in Cairo.    In a predeparture statement at Ankara's Esenboga Airport,  Cetin said that the agreement is a historic turning point with  regard to formulating the structure of Palestinian self-rule in  Gaza and Jericho. Pointing out that peace is a process which  needs time and patience, Cetin explained that there have been  difficulties since the Declaration of Principles agreement was  signed in Washington. Stressing that peace-loving countries in  the region made great efforts, Cetin added:    [Begin Cetin recording] The personal contributions of  Egypt's -- friend and brother Egypt's -- President Husni Mubarak  expedited the signing of the agreement. Turkey, from the start,  contributed to the Middle East peace process and stated that  only by negotiations and dialogue can peace be achieved in the  Middle East. Within this framework, Turkey participated in all  the multilateral meetings -- five working groups -- and  perpetuated its contributions toward the peace process.    From the beginning, Turkey supported the five working groups  and was an active participant in these multilateral meetings.  As a matter of fact, Turkey used its historical, brotherly, and  cultural relations with the Arab world and its good relations  with Israel, as the only Muslim country which recognized it from  the beginning, positively. Turkey always used its relations  with Israel and with brotherly and friendly Arab countries  toward peace. The point reached today is historical. [end  recording]    Expressing great happiness at being able to participate as  an  observer at such an important agreement, Cetin said that Turkey  will continue to contribute to the peace process in the  restructured Middle East.    Cetin will return to Turkey after the Gaza-Jericho agreement  signing ceremony.</p>

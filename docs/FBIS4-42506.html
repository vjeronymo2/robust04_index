			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["hjh" report: "Kanther To Check Constitutional Faith of </F> Republikaner; Right-Wing Radical Party Excluded From Landtag  Election"]    [Text] Following the banning of the Republikaner from the  Saxony-Anhalt Landtag elections on 26 June, there are increasing  calls for stricter state sanctions against this radical  right-wing party. CDU [Christian Democratic Union] and SPD  [Social Democratic Party of Germany] politicians have agreed to  petition Interior Minister Kanther to check whether the conduct  of the Republikaner conforms to the Constitution. Nevertheless,  calls for a ban on the Republikaner are controversial. Rudolf  Krause, chairman of the Republikaner in Saxony-Anhalt, refuses  to accept his party's exclusion. An objection can only be  considered after the elections. Should the objection be  granted, the election result would have to be declared void.    At a meeting on Wednesday [1 June], the Landtag Election  Committee of Saxony-Anhalt decided by four votes to three to  exclude the Republikaner from the elections. The reason it gave  was irregular procedures when formulating the election list.  Several Republikaner members had complained about the fact that  the choice of Halle as location for the party's candidate  nomination congress in March had been kept secret, as a result  of which they could not attend this congress. Even so, Paul-Uwe  Soeker, election manager for Saxony-Anhalt, recommended that the  Republikaner be permitted to run in the elections, saying that  similar procedures for drawing up election lists had been  approved in Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein. Rudolf Krause,  land chairman of the Republikaner, described his party's  exclusion as a "dagger thrust against democracy" and announced  judicial measures. Soeker said on Thursday evening that he  would ask the Landtag Election Committee to reconsider its  decision.    Meanwhile, there were increasing calls from the Bonn  factions  to deal with the Republikaner more harshly. Horst Eylmann  (CDU), head of the Bundestag Legal Committee, said he has  serious doubts whether the Repubikaner are a democratic party.  Eylmann referred to the latest resignations and accusations  among the party leadership, as well as the findings of the  Office for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV]. If it  transpires that the Republikaner have tolerated acts of violence  or even actively supported them, that will be the right time to  file an application to ban the party, said Eylmann. Ulrich  Maier, the man responsible for domestic policy among SPD  chancellor candidate Rudolf Scharping's election staff, said  that placing the Republikaner in the category of a right-wing  extremist party is long overdue. Party chairman Schoenhuber's  image is "similar that to the National Socialist Democratic  Workers' Party," said Maurer. Nevertheless, he opposed a ban on  the party because the necessary process might take many years.  Johannes Gerster, acting chairman of the CDU/CSU Bundestag  group, also said that a ban would make little sense. A lot of  time would pass before the Constitutional Court decided to  impose a ban, and until then the Republikaner might develop an  image as martyrs. SPD politician Peter Glotz said that a ban  might be legally possible, but would not serve anyone's  interests. Both Gerster and Glotz said that the Repubikaner  should be combated by political means.    According to the BfV, there is a "series of legally valid  criteria" suggesting that the Republikaner are developing into a  extremist right-wing party. Ernst Uhrlau, chief of the Hamburg  BFV, said in SAARLAENDISCHER RUNDFUNK that the Republikaner had  expressed "subdued pleasure" with acts of violence, particularly  in 1991 and 1992. "A hatred of foreigners and anti-Semitism are  expressed quite openly and extolled in smaller circles," he  said. "The Republikaner and other right-wing extremist groups  consider themselves a national political camp."    Republikaner chief Franz Schoenhuber denied that he had  called for a "hunt to seek out and destroy fractious party  members." This accusation had been expressed by Udo Boesch,  head of the Republikaner federal organization, who quit this  week. Boesch spoke of threats against his person and against  Martina Rosenberger, federal secretary of the party, who also  quit this week. Both Boesch and Rosenberger attribute their  resignations to the Republikaner's increasingly extremist way of  thinking and to Schoenhuber's dictatorial style of leadership.</p>

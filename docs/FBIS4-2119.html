			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanjing, April 5 (XINHUA) -- Farmers' cash income in  East China's Jiangsu Province increased by 206.2 yuan on average  last year, a record provincial high for the 1990s.    In 1993, farmers in Jiangsu, one of China's richest  provinces, registered a per capita net income of 1,266.9 yuan,  an increase of 19.4 percent over the previous year. After  deduction of price rises, average income grew by three percent.    Last year was the first year for the market economy to be  introduced into every economic sector of the province.    Township enterprises contributed the bulk of the increased  income.    Last year, township enterprises in the province reported an  industrial output value of more than 40 million yuan, an  increase of 5.4 percent over that of the previous year and  accounting for about 75.5 percent of that of the province's  entire rural economy.    In 1993, one out of every five local farmers worked in  township enterprises or worked as transient laborers in  wealthier provinces.    Statistics show that more than half of local farmers' added  income came from township enterprises.    Brisk markets are creating more sources for cash income for  farmers.    In the past, Chinese farmers relied almost entirely on  farming for cash income, and their income was mainly in the form  of crops and grain.    In 1993, cash income accounted for 70.3 percent of a Jiangsu  farmer's total income, a slight increase over that of the  previous year, while his cash income from selling grain  decreased.    The facts indicate that farmers are profiting more from  industry, commercial ventures and the service sector.    In addition, some farmers have started investing in treasury  bonds and stocks.</p>

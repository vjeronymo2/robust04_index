			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Coming to terms with Europe's late payers - Exporters need a strategy for collecting overdue bills The arrival of the single European market - and more recently sterling's exit from the exchange rate mechanism - has encouraged more British companies to think of exporting to the Continent. But what awaits the British exporter across the Channel? One answer is even longer delays before payment than they currently endure in the UK. This may surprise smaller British companies who believe they already wait an inordinate length of time at home and are lobbying the government for a statutory right to interest on overdue bills. But Italian companies, for example, settle their bills on average after 130 days - compared with payment terms in the UK of 60-90 days. French companies, Europe's second slowest payers, settle after 121 days, according to the Association of British Factors and Discounters. Both countries' payment records have deteriorated over the past year and even the Germans, usually considered among Europe's promptest payers, are making their suppliers wait longer. By contrast, UK companies paid their bills this year in 59 days compared with 62 days last year, says the ABFD. Exporters to Scandinavia, Switzerland and the Netherlands are most likely to be paid on time. According to the ABFD some continental European customers offer to pay on time only if their suppliers accept discounts. In Spain and Italy these discounts have reached as high as 20 per cent. There are, however, ways in which the exporters, usually the slowest to collect, can reduce the risk of late payment. Finding the right distributor is essential, although smaller companies with limited management resources inevitably find it difficult to discover who is likely to pay on time and who is not. One solution is to use a factoring service to help vet distributors' credit-worthiness and manage the sales ledger. Eighteen months ago late payment by Italian customers was hampering the rapid expansion of Micra Instruments, a small Luton-based manufacturer of surgical instruments which exports most of its production. The company turned to Alex Lawrie, a Lloyds Bank subsidiary, which immediately helped Micra to change some of its distributors and rapidly improved its cash flow. Alex Lawrie also formalised credit controls and introduced a discipline Micra previously lacked. 'We have learnt about the realistic establishment of credit limits,' says Peter Richardson, managing director. 'Anyone can ship product and not get paid for it.' Foreign customers are now allowed a tightly controlled amount of credit. 'You have to be ruthless. As much as this might hurt your business it is better not to supply than not to get paid.' Factors argue that their services are particularly useful to companies like Micra Instruments which are growing rapidly and need to increase cash flow. A factoring facility is 'dynamic' in that it allows a company to raise more cash as its sales ledger grows - it will typically be advanced up to 80 per cent of the value of its invoices, depending on their credit-worthiness. An overdraft limit, by contrast, will generally not grow as sales increase. Factoring does not have the best of names. It is still frequently seen as a service required only by banks' poorest credit risks. But Michael Hulme, managing director of Naturaldata, a Lancaster-based company which writes software to help companies control the cost of factoring, says it is particularly suited to exporters. 'Sales-based companies are often not very good at managing credit control,' Hulme says. 'Factoring companies help on the credit control side.'</p>

Nasirullah Babar, federal home  minister, has announced that all foreigners including Arabs  living here will be deported. The home minister told the news  reporters in Peshawar about his government's decision that all  foreigners who took part in the Afghanistan jihad will be  deported from Pakistan. The truth is that this action is being  taken under U.S. pressure. Calling the Arab nationals living in  Pakistan terrorists and instigators is inappropriate and an  extreme action. These people support an Islamic form of  government and are those who took part in the Afghanistan jihad  against the Russian aggression. The service they have provided  to the Muslim world and Pakistan by leaving their far away  countries to participate in the Afghanistan jihad cannot be  forgotten. These are the mujaheddin who protected Afghanistan  and Pakistan from the oppression of communism and the Soviet  Union. They participated in the Afghan jihad side-by-side with  the Afghan brothers without any racial or regional prejudice,  and made many sacrifices. They still have great courage and are  ready to help the Muslim world wherever brutalities are  committed against them. The truth is that these Arab nationals  are an asset to Pakistan. They can be used in the jihad in  Kashmir.    They are ready to go to occupied Kashmir to help our  Kashmiri  brothers in their struggle for independence just like they  helped in Afghanistan. India and its ally, the United States,  are worried about it. The United States does not want the  movement of Kashmiris to become like the one in Afghanistan.  Therefore, it wants them expelled from Pakistan by accusing them  of terrorism. The Government of Pakistan should not play into  U.S. hands at all!</p>

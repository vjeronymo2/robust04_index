			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / National Lottery consortium to make only partial bid Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of the Rainbow consortium, has decided to make only a partial bid to run the National Lottery. The consortium, which also includes Mr Richard Wheatly, chairman of Leo Burnett, the advertising group, has decided that it wants to run only the instant - or scratch card - part of the lottery. This could account for anything from a quarter to a third of the lottery revenues - more than Pounds 1bn. Rainbow will apply for the main operator's licence - but its bid will indicate that it intends to sub-contract the main part of the lottery - the on-line network of computer terminals. Rainbow said yesterday that Mr Peter Davis, director-general of the National Lottery, had confirmed that such an approach was possible under the rules. The consortium did, however, have to make its intentions clear about the on-line part of the business. Sir Patrick, chairman of BAT industries, said yesterday that splitting the on-line part from the instant games would generate competition and help increase the overall sum raised for the five causes that would benefit - arts, charities, heritage, the millennium fund and sport. Mr Wheatly said yesterday: 'We don't believe it would necessarily be in the public interest to see the lottery simply fall into the hands of a single, all-embracing consortium.' Monday is the deadline for the submission of bids for the main operator's licence and at least eight consortia are expected to submit bids. Rainbow conceded yesterday that it has no agreement with any other consortium to run the main on-line business or any agreement that it should run the instant part of anyone's else's operation. 'We wish to differentiate ourselves and play to our strengths,' said Sir Patrick, who conceded that detailed talks with large corporations to back a bid to run the entire lottery had come to nothing. Leo Burnett has considerable experience in marketing charity lotteries and lotteries in other countries and believes that different skills are needed to run instant games. As many as 40,000 outlets are being planned and retailers will be able to pick up packs of cards from cash-and-carry outlets. As many as 4m prizes a week would be available through the scratch cards with a top prize of at least Pounds 75,000. In addition, main prize winners could become eligible for a prize that could be as much as Pounds 1m a month. Meanwhile IBM UK, the technology partner in Mr Richard Branson's UK Lottery Foundation bid, said yesterday that it would offer an early launch date and could launch an on-line lottery as early as this November.</p>

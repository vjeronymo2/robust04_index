			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Arts: Alarm bells for real - Off the Wall AFTER more cries of wolf than even Dracula could manage, arts organisations throughout the UK could finally be in real trouble in the next few weeks. The local authorities give over Pounds 300m a year to the arts, more than the Arts Council, and in recent years many have started to be proud of this expenditure. Glasgow, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds are just some of the cities that have spent heavily on the arts to raise their profile to draw in business investment and tourist expenditure. But remorseless cuts in government funding, and the need for local authorities to concentrate resources on front line activities like housing and welfare, mean that the arts could suffer real damage in 1993-94. The final decisions will not be made for a month or so but the alarm bells are ringing furiously around the land. London seems certain to be badly hit, with the boroughs of Brent, Hounslow, Lambeth, Camden and Hammersmith giving most cause for concern. It is the arts centres receiving over Pounds 100,000 a year, like the Tricycle Theatre in Brent and the Watermans in Hounslow, which are biting their nails. The Young Vic in Lambeth and the Greenwich Festival are also in the frame for cuts. They are unlikely to lose all, but reductions of up to 30 per cent could decimate their activities. The Arts Council has made clear that it cannot increase its 1993-94 grants, which it has already announced. Nor can the London Arts Board. There is talk of the loss of one major arts venue in the next few months. Outside the capital, the Victoria Theatre in Stoke, the Octagon in Bolton, the Crucible and Lyceum theatres in Sheffield, and the Bristol Old Vic are thought to be vulnerable to reduced grants. In Manchester the council seems to have singled out the Library and Forum theatres, and Liverpool is in its usual knife-edge state. The Bournemouth Orchestra is very concerned, and even the famed arts of Birmingham are not regarded as immune from the Council's declared cuts in its budget. Perhaps the greatest devastation will occur in towns like Harlow and Milton Keynes where the necessary cost savings could only be achieved by halving or eliminating altogether arts expenditure. Activities like theatre in schools are an obvious candidate for the chop following reductions in the education budget in Greater Manchester and elsewhere. What makes the situation much more serious this year is that alternative sources of funding are just not there. The Arts Council has pegged its grants to an average 2.5 per cent rise; commercial sponsorship is much harder to come by; and box office revenue is falling virtually everywhere. There is also the knowledge that the Arts Council faces an actual reduction in its grant for 1994-95. Many arts companies, and local authorities, feel that if the situation is likely to deteriorate further, it is hardly worth trying to struggle through this year. The combination could lead to closures. But its more insidious effect will be to make theatres, orchestras, dance companies, and opera houses play safe, presenting traditionally popular works for longer periods and avoiding the new and the challenging. It is a short term solution which will lead to a long term disaffection with the arts. All this is just one more headache for the Heritage Secretary Peter Brooke who so far has shown himself to be a lack lustre defender of the arts, in thrall to his civil servants. If he could promise to restore cash growth in 1994-95 the will to live would be stronger. As things stand the Arts Council might well avert its gaze if a flagship arts company goes to the wall, in the hope that a first rate crisis will force the government to take funding the arts more seriously. ***** On March 21 Radio 3 is transmitting The Hammer, a gothic thriller presented by the touring drama company Red Shift Theatre. Independent productions have started to infiltrate the very soul of BBC Radio. This is partly a matter of cost saving; partly an attempt to widen the creative input. It is strange that with all the new plays appearing on the Fringe, or even in sizeable theatres, few get a radio airing. If anything the flow has been the other way. Howard Barker's Scenes from an Execution started on the radio before being fleshed out by Glenda Jackson at the Almeida last year, and the Traverse in Edinburgh will soon play host to Tom Courtney in Moscow Station, a Radio 3 production of last summer. The Hammer, which stars Martin Jarvis and Bill Nighy, is produced by Essential Productions, which sees radio as wide open for independent producers. And not just in drama: coming up shortly is Radio 3's first independent music series, Re-wind, hosted by singer Robert Tear. What has slowed the process is the lack of experience of working in radio by theatre and music directors. But the situation in the UK is paradise compared with American radio which is totally monopolised by music, usually from the pop charts. A few years ago a group of Hollywood actors set up LA Theatre Works in an attempt to create a domestic radio drama industry. Naturally they looked to the BBC for advice and commissions and a succession of movie names, like Richard Dreyfus, periodically quit LA for a week or so to record in London. This month Walter Matthau makes his radio debut at the age of 72 in a Fay Weldon play, The Hole in the Top of the World. ***** Like many other businesses the Edinburgh Festival is currently in thrall to the slump in sterling. Its fall has raised the cost of some planned events by 20 per cent and makes it difficult to confirm whether visits from overseas companies are financially viable. But Edinburgh has boldly announced the bones of the 1993 Festival, the first in which the hand of new director Brian McMaster is visible. No surprise that there is no one big overwhelming theme, and no surprise that opera is prominent, which reflects both McMaster's taste, and research suggesting that opera pulled in visitors who then added on other events. A highlight is 'Verdi - from first to last', starting with his first, very rare Oberto, ending with Falstaff, with three in between. There is also a Schubert meets Janacek theme, and anticipated visits by 14 major orchestras bringing in their train Tennstedt, Schiff, Lott, Donohoe, and more. In theatre directors are named but not their plays. They are an impressive international quartet - Peter Stein, Robert Lepage, Klaus Michael Gruber and Robert Wilson. In dance the Mark Morris group makes a swift return after its 1992 success and also from the US there is a debut by the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Company.</p>

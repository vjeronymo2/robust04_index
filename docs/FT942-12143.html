			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / Survey of Clocks, Watches and Jewellery (4): Clocks begin to tick - Demand is rising and bargains getting fewer The past year or so has seen time hang heavily on the auction trade in clocks; move more briskly for some watches; and positively buzz along for jewels. But there are signs that the era of low, indeed bargain, prices for higher quality antique clocks in the saleroom might be about to pass. Demand has been brisker at recent auctions, and this should tempt on to the market some of the good clocks which have been waiting for the higher prices to return. Many people like the idea of owning an antique clock, an impressive 18th century longcase ticking away in their hall, but are deterred by their ignorance and fears about the condition and conservation of such mature specimens. They need not worry. At its last auction, Sotheby's offered 41 longcase clocks dating from the 1720s to 1900 and sold all but one at prices ranging from Pounds 800 to Pounds 10,000. A decent Georgian clock can be acquired in the saleroom for under Pounds 2,000. A restorer might charge Pounds 350 to put the mechanism in working order and repairs might also be needed to the case. But, for less than Pounds 3,500, you can have an attractive working antique. Of course the big names - Tompions, Knibbs, Grahams and Delander - cost much more. Any serious - and rich - collector of antiques should have a clock by the father of British clockmaking, Thomas Tompion, on their buying list. His appeal is international. Working in the late 17th and early 18th centuries he commands a premium over all other makers. In 1989, a rare blonde wood Tompion sold for Pounds 880,000. This was at the peak of the antiques market but even in the doldrums of last June Christie's offered some Tompions and they all made good prices, with a tiny, 6 1/3 in high, silver mounted ebony bracket clock, probably made for King William III, selling for Pounds 441,500, and a table clock for Pounds 298,500. Since then, no important clock has appeared at auction, and the sluggish demand of recent years has made a simple clock by Tompion (almost) affordable. No Tompions are on offer at the important June auctions in London, but a top dealer such as R A Lee, (now part of Aspreys) could probably supply one for less than Pounds 100,000 and a routine bracket clock by Tompion might be acquired for as little as Pounds 40,000. Prices are low mainly because dealers have run down their stocks and are unwilling to start buying again - yet. French clocks, with a wider range of collectors, are a slightly firmer market, but a 19th century carriage clock can still be bought for Pounds 1,000. There is greater interest in the elaborate French Empire mantel clocks, the more unusually decorative the better. Here prices have edged up in the past year or so, but an excellent example should cost less than Pounds 4,000. There are many people who just cannot cope with the antique, with the problems of maintenance. They want the finest craftsmanship, but they want it to be contemporary. There is at least one British clockmaker still working in the traditional way, with virtually every component made in house. Sinclair Harding, of Cheltenham, makes no more than 20 clocks a year and, at the Basle fair introduced a new model, a skeleton sun and moon clock, plated in gold and priced at around Pounds 8,000. Watches have become the great fashion accessory, a palpable sign of wealth and taste. They are now traded regularly in the salerooms, a service to sellers who want to cash in expensive watches that might seem, to them, dated: or they might have been given a newer model. You can acquire a recent Breguet, Rolex, Cartier, Audemars Piguet or Patek Phillipe watch for perhaps half its retail value. An older watch would be even cheaper. A good solid pocket watch, a hunter, made in the late 19th century by the celebrated Charles Frodsham, can still be bought for less than Pounds 4,000, and will prove a reliable friend and an agreeable heirloom. In the past year, jewels have become second only to Impressionist and modern art as a money spinner for Sotheby's and Christie's. In 1993 Sotheby's brought in Dollars 475m from jewels sales and Christie's Dollars 358m. In 1970 jewels were an insignificant sector. The great majority of the trade is in stones, mainly diamonds, with a few rich dealers, especially the Saudi Arabian Sheikh Ahmed Fitaihi, buying the most expensive stones, including the Dollars 11.88m he paid for a 100-carat diamond at Sotheby's in November. Most of the buyers are Arabs, followed by Chinese and Latin Americans, and there is an undoubted investment element behind the competition of the last two years. But high prices for stones has a knock-on effect on jewellery. Salerooms have done their best to promote their involvement, stressing that as well as glitzy events at Geneva and St Moritz they also hold auctions, such as the evening 'Colonnade' events at Sotheby's, the sales at Christie's South Kensington, Phillips and Bonhams, where lots usually sell for Pounds 2,000 or less. More private buyers are daring to take on the dealers in the saleroom and are acquiring jewellery, from 19th century to contemporary, at modest expense. Although the auction houses offer clocks, watches and jewels at wholesale prices many people still prefer to collect with a dealer holding their hand. Good dealers are keen to offer impartial advice; they guarantee the authenticity and condition of the goods, which is so important with antique clocks; and they will often agree to buy them back. A specialist clock dealer, such as Anthony Woodburn, of Tunbridge Wells, Kent, also often has its own sources of supply, and can offer a year-round service. While English furniture has generally ridden out the recession well, clocks have remained in their specialist ghetto. Why people keen to acquire 18th and 19th century tables and chairs, dressers and desks, should baulk at buying an antique clock is not clear. Perhaps their sheer size counts against substantial late 19th century longcase (grandfather) clocks, but bracket clocks, carriage clocks, mantel clocks and lantern clocks and chronometers provide charm and utility. It is probably the mystery of the inner workings that deters potential collectors. But there has never been a better time to acquire an antique clock, either in the euphoria of the auction house, or after careful consultation with a dealer.</p>

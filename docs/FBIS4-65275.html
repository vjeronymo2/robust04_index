			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl has  announced a deregulation offensive in the European Union [EU]  under the German presidency in the second half of 1994.  Decisions should be made in Brussels only if they have to be  made there, Kohl today told a conference of the Central  Federation of German Commercial Travelers' and Brokers'  Associations in Bonn.    At the same time, the chancellor again supported European  unity. It is essential not only for the German economy. Europe  is also insurance against a relapse into chauvinism, ethnic  conflicts, and religious fanaticism, which are present not just  in the Balkans.</p>

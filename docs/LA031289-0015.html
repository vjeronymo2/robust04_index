			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUND &amp; VISION: LIVING ON VIDEO;  </P> <P> NEW CLIPS BY ROY ORBISON, THE TRAVELING WILBURYS, HANKS JR. (&amp; SR.)  ENSHRINE THE DEARLY DEPARTED  </P> <P> You're an executive at a record company and you're pleased as punch because one  of your artists has a hit record about to break in a big way. The next step is  to make a video for the song.  </P> <P> You've only got one problem: The lead singer is dead . . . and, it goes without  saying, unable to make your shooting schedule.  </P> <P> So how do you create a clip around a star who has breathed his last "120  Minutes"? That was the dilemma facing three companies when it came time to  shoot videos for current singles: Roy Orbison's "You Got It," the Traveling  Wilburys' "End of the Line" (which features Orbison as one of several lead  vocalists) and the "duet" between Hank Williams Jr. and his very late daddy in  "There's a Tear in My Beer."  </P> <P> In all three cases, directors managed to find a creative and satisfying  solution to the problem of dealing with the dearly departed.  </P> <P> Those three video eulogies are among the clips featured in this month's Sound  &amp; Vision, where current pop videos are rated on a 0-100 scale.  </P> <P> Clips Picked to Click:  </P> <P> Elvis Costello's "Veronica." (Director: Evan English.) It's not flashy, but it  just may be one of the best pop videos ever. At its beginning and end, Costello  is in a nursing home talking about his late grandmother, wondering if rather  than suffering from senility or forgetfulness, she had "gone to hide" in the  recesses of her memories. Then it's off for a trip through the decades in that  very full mind, set to Costello's bouncy but dramatic ditty, as the aged  Veronica flashes back through an entire lifetime -- girlhood swims, adult  passions, marriage, the war, tears, arguments, joy.  </P> <P> Whenever the video cuts back to Costello in the nursing home, we actually hear  him on the sound track quietly singing along to his record. Thus we get the  benefit of the song's full production and a sense of the gentle sadness  Costello must have had when writing the tune. Even if "Veronica" didn't stand  out for interrupting the non-stop juvenilia of MTV with the reality of the  elderly, its supremely emotional juxtaposition of lyric and image might still  be enough to send chills down your spine. Bravo. 97  </P> <P> Michael Jackson's "Leave Me Alone." (Director: Kim Blashfield.) Jackson has  always seemed so out of touch with the world that it's a surprise to see him in  such a reflexive mode in this surreal video journey. Against the paranoid  sentiment of the song's lyric, Jackson allows the visuals to take a wittier,  possibly even self-mocking, turn. Amid the computer-graphics maelstrom are a  blur of real-life tabloid headlines, including one about his relationship with  Elizabeth Taylor and another about his reported attempt to buy the bones of the  Elephant Man. What do we see next but a weirdly disembodied Liz herself,  followed by a hilarious shot of Michael dancing alongside the skeleton of an  elephant? To quote one of the many songs that Jackson owns, turn off your mind,  relax and float downstream. 79  </P> <P> Karel Fialka's "Hey Matthew." (Director: Brad Langford.) The point of view here  is from the inside of a TV set, from which we view the concerned face of father  Fialka and the blank, impressionable one of his young son Matthew as they  switch channels. By clip's end, it's easy to identify with Fialka's parental  worries: What chance do the professions of doctor, lawyer, policeman or fireman  have in young Matthew's mind, pitted against the glorified images of Rambo and  the A-Team? 78  </P> <P> Worth a Look and a Listen:  </P> <P> Hank Williams Jr.'s "There's a Tear in My Beer." (Director: Ethan Russell.) One  dark and stormy night, Hank Jr. is recording one of his legendary pop's  unreleased compositions when lightning strikes the studio. Suddenly, a  silhouette is seen on the glass of the door and the voice of Hank Sr. joins his  son's. The junior Williams opens the door, and there's his long-dead daddy,  complete with his '50s band, in glorious black and white. Hank Jr. steps in and  father and son happily duet to the finish.  </P> <P> Since this recently discovered song was recorded only as a demo by Hank Sr.,  you might well wonder where they got this sterling footage of the long-gone  crooner singing the tune with a band. Simple (almost): Director Russell dug up  kinescope footage of Williams singing another song on TV and superimposed  someone else's lips singing "Tear in My Beer." Then came the superimposition of  Hank Jr. as well. This video is creepy in more ways than one -- not the least  of which might be its bizarre, ultimate wish-fulfillment for the obsessive Hank  Jr. 69  </P> <P> The Traveling Wilburys' "End of the Line." (Director: Willy Smax.) Roy Orbison,  who died in December, is but one of the lead singers of this life-affirming  ditty, along with George Harrison, Jeff Lynne and Tom Petty. When the Lonely  One's verse comes along, the director cuts to a shot of a chair with Orbison's  guitar, rocking all by itself. Simple, but as effective as possible given the  circumstances. 67  </P> <P> Roy Orbison's "You Got It." (Director: Leslie Libman.) Orbison had sung this  current hit during a European TV appearance filmed before a live audience.  Rather than use a straightforward rendering of that film, the director chose to  capitalize on Orbison's mysterious, almost ghostly image by projecting the  footage onto billowing curtains. 65  </P> <P> Gamma Ray Rot:  </P> <P> U2's "Angel of Harlem." (Director: Richard Lowenstein.) If U2 is the band of  the '80s, then why hasn't the group made a single good video? This disastrous  visual mishmash, which accompanies a terrific single, is no exception. On the  one hand, it's a souvenir travelogue capturing the Irish quartet attending the  many premieres of its recent film, "Rattle and Hum," replete with flashbulbs  and adoring fans. On the other hand, it's a tribute to the song's subject, the  late Billie Holiday, replete with shots of poor black folks. Is U2 trying to  ironically contrast its incredible success with Holiday's tragic fate, or do  the four lads just like shots of themselves getting out of limousines? Either  way, this is truly asinine. 30  </P> <P> House of Lords' "I Wanna Be Loved." (Director: Jim Shay.) "I just wanna be  loved by a girl like you," sings hairy frontman James Christian, even though  the abundance of scantily-clad members of the shapelier sex ought to force a  plural reading of girl. Among the countless lasses by whom our hero wants to be  loved are a blonde and brunette glimpsed during a kinky party scene sharing a  riding crop -- an instrument that would be put to much better use by these  silly soft-metal boys' mamas on their sonnys' behinds. 0  </P> <P> Sheena Easton's "The Lover in Me." (Director: Dominic Sena.) Ever since Prince  got hold of her, Sheena has been suffering from an acute bout of Olivia  Newton-John Syndrome -- that tragic disease that causes harmless easy-listening  queens to turn into disco divas who wield sex as a weapon. But Olivia never  sank this low. In this clip, Sheena is once again the lady in red, on stage in  a nightclub where other barely dressed young ladies lie on the bar and allow  male patrons to splash buckets of water over their nubile bodies,  "Flashdance"-style. (Places like that are just a dime a dozen in L.A., aren't  they?) On stage, Easton pruriently pouts, teases and entices until, finally,  one understandably red-blooded fellow rushes the stage -- only to be carted off  by bouncers as Sheena looks shocked. You can look -- look a lot, please,  insists Sheena -- but you better not touch, or even come within nine yards.  What a role model this gal is. 0  </P></p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of US Communications (3): Roadblocks hinder free flow  -The complicated regulatory maze on the US highway A great number of road blocks need to be removed before the information superhighway stretches unhindered across the US. At present, an immensely complicated regulatory and legal maze restricts competition between the various industries trying to secure a place on the highway. And the federal government has to establish public policy goals to ensure reasonable access to the network for all Americans. The central difficulty is that the framework governing America's communications industries reflects a world which in many respects is becoming anachronistic - where telephone lines were scarce resources and the industry was viewed as a 'natural monopoly'. For much of the past century that monopoly was embodied in American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, which provided local telephone services across much of the US (though other phone companies, notably GTE, provide services in a patchwork of other regions) and linked the nation together with its monopoly long-distance service. This settled framework began to change in the late 1960s and early 1970s when a small, upstart phone company called MCI Communications began to challenge AT&amp;T's hold on the long-distance market. The conflict that developed between them played a large part in prompting an anti-trust investigation of AT&amp;T which in 1984 led to the court-ordered break-up of the group. AT&amp;T was required to spin off its local operations into seven separate 'Baby Bell' companies. Fearing that these would use their monopoly profits to compete unfairly in other markets, the court banned them from the long-distance market, the manufacture of equipment and information services. This left AT&amp;T with: its long distance business, which had to compete against rivals such as MCI on a much more level playing field; its Bell Laboratories research arm; and its equipment manufacturing operations. In 1991, the Baby Bells managed to get the courts to lift the ban on them providing information services. However, they - and every other telephone company - remain barred under 1984 legislation from owning and delivering a cable television service in the area where they operate a conventional telephone service. The cable companies, which are regulated by some state agencies and many municipal franchising authorities, have thus been able to remain de facto monopolies until now. Over the past few years market forces and technological change have begun battering at this 1984 framework. State and federal regulators have allowed small, nimble rivals to cream off a little of the Baby Bells' business traffic, and MCI is now threatening to enter this area and bring to the local market the same competition it introduced into long distance. Cable television companies are also threatening to provide alternative telephone services to domestic customers. The Baby Bells, for their part, are getting into the cable business. In a landmark court case, Bell Atlantic last year won the right to compete against cable companies in its own operating area, after successfully arguing that the 1984 cable act infringed its right to free speech. Several other Baby Bells now have similar cases pending before the courts. The Bell companies are also redoubling their long-time campaign to be allowed into the long-distance market. Ameritech, the Chicago-based local operator, is making this a quid pro quo for it opening up its entire network in the state of Illinois to competition. BellSouth is arguing before the courts that AT&amp;T should not be allowed to complete its Dollars 12bn takeover of McCaw Cellular - the largest cellular phone operator in the US, and a wireless competitor to many Baby Bells - until the Bell companies are allowed to compete in long-distance and equipment manufacturing. However, this sniping on multiple fronts may be subsumed this year by comprehensive legislation now before Congress, which has the broad backing of the Clinton White House, though it may propose some modification to the two bills. Vice-President Al Gore, a long-time expert on telecommunications matters, has made the creation of the 'information superhighway' an important plank of government policy. The administration does not intend to finance this itself, but it wants to clear away the road blocks to private sector investment. One bill, the so-called Markey/Fields legislation, would give new competitors, including the cable operators, the right to compete with local telephone companies and use their facilities on a non-discriminatory basis to interconnect with consumers. The bill would also allow the federal authorities to over-ride the myriad state laws and regulations which govern the telephone industry and might impede this goal. In return, the phone companies would be free to set up video services in competition with cable, though they would still be barred from buying local cable operators. The aim here would be to preserve two suppliers of multi-media services, rather than creating one new and yet more powerful local monopoly in each area. The second bill, the so-called Brooks/Dingell legislation, would allow the Baby Bells to escape their chains and enter the manufacturing industry after a one-year wait and the long-distance market after five years. But while most interested parties are agreed that this is a sensible, broad framework for legislation, there are going to be many fierce battles over the fine print, as the protagonists fight for advantage. One important issue is how to fulfil a commitment to 'universal service' - allowing anyone to have a phone service in their home at reasonable cost, no matter how remote their location - which has been embodied in US legislation since the landmark Communications Act of 1934. The local telephone companies have achieved this by subsiding their residential rates by overcharging business and long-distance customers. But they can no longer do this when they have lost their monopoly power to impose higher prices on business customers. At the same time, new local competitors will not be keen to pick up the universal service mantle, since their natural instinct will be to focus on the most profitable customers. There is general agreement that a mechanism has to be found which ensures that all providers of basic services share proportionately in the cost of subsidies. MCI, for example, has suggested that each carrier should contribute a percentage of its total telecommunications transmission and switching revenue. The money would be pooled and administered by an independent third party, which would allow customers to 'spend' their universal service benefit with the local service provider of their choice. But even defining what should constitute universal service in an interactive multi-media age could prove troublesome. Simply limiting it to a basic phone service would risk turning densely populated urban areas into information 'haves' and rural areas into 'have nots'. Yet until it becomes clearer what consumer demand really exists for the new services, it will be hard to decide what should be universally available. And these ideas are bound to change as services yet undreamt-of are added to the system.</p>

According to our correspondent  in New York, Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's special  representative in Cyprus, has asked for the team. The team  which will depart Monday [28 February], comprises one legal  adviser and one official on issues of public administration. A  third expert from the International Civil Aviation Organization  will come to Cyprus later.    Our correspondent reports that the duties of the three  experts will be to assist Feissel with the technical details of  the various aspects of the confidence-building measures. The  legal adviser will basically assist with the terminology of the  text of agreement. The work of the official in charge of public  administration issues is related to the planning of the  organizational structure of the UN administration of the fenced  area of Famagusta and Nicosia Airport. The third expert's duties  are related with the operation of Nicosia International Airport,  flight control and other related issues.    Our correspondent reports that the experts will not prepare  new reports, nor does their presence mean there will be an  effort to change the reports prepared by the two teams of  experts for Famagusta and Nicosia Airport.    Our correspondent also reports that another UN expert, Peter  Taylor, will leave for Cyprus Monday.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vientiane, March 30 (KPL) -- Lao PDR [People's  Democratic Republic] National Assembly President Saman  Vi-gnaket, on March 28 evening, hosted a banquet in honour of  his Malaysian counterpart Tan Sri Datuk Mohamed Zahir bin Haji  Ismail and his party.    At the banquet, the Lao National Assembly president and the  speaker of the Malaysian House of Representatives exchanged  speeches describing the growing Lao-Malaysian relations. Other  Lao National Assembly members and senior government officials  attended the function.    In his speech, Saman Vi-gnaket expressed his belief that the  successful visit to Laos by the high-level delegation of the  Malaysian House of Representatives would further strengthen the  friendly traditional relations between Laos and Malaysia as well  as between the two legislative bodies. He said the result of  the visit is a gain of the common effort by the people of the  two countries, and the personal effort of the Malaysian speaker  of the house.    He also said: Laos and Malaysia are in the same region, and  have always mutually supported and enjoyed good relations of  friendship and neighbourly cooperation. The people of the two  nations have shared similarities in their characters and  languages. They love peace, freedom, progress and justice, have  no wish to interfere in other countries' affairs. Malaysia is a  country within the Nonaligned Movement that observes the  principles and goals of the movement. This has made the people  of the two countries understand and trust one another.    Saman Vi-gnaket was pleased with the achievements the  Malaysian Government and people have scored in their national  development, and thanked them for their support, assistance to  Laos in the task of national salvation in the past as well as  that of national development at present.    The speaker of the Malaysian House on Representatives  reciprocated by saying in his speech that he was impressed by  the Buddha images, especially the earthen one of the sixth  century, he saw while visiting the Emerald Buddha Shine. They  served as an evidence of Laos' capability in art works, as well  as its long history and civilization.    He said that they were pleased at seeing that the two  countries had enjoyed a close relationship and we had tried to  help one another. He added that Malaysia was ready to provide  education and training opportunities in Malaysia for Lao  students.    He also said that Laos was implementing its five-year  development plan for 1991-95 and that the Constitution endorsed  in 1991 guaranteed commercial production, private properties and  private investment by both locals and foreigners. Besides  hydro-power and mineral resources, he said, Laos was abundant  with other natural resources. All the potentials will lead the  country to a bright future, he added.    The head of the Malaysian delegation also said that in the  next few weeks, the prime minister of Malaysia will make his  first visit to Laos to further strengthen relationship and  friendship between the two countries. The prime minister's  delegation will include many Malaysian businessmen, who will  identify economic investment in Laos. He hoped this visit would  help bring the two people closer to each other. He also invited  the Lao National Assembly president and its members to visit  Malaysia soon.</p>

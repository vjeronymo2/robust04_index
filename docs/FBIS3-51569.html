The  demonstrators are protesting against an increase in  transportation fares and the sales tax, although the application  of the latter at the consumer level was postponed until 28  February, media sources here reported.    Disturbances started near the Central University of  Venezuela  (UCV), in the strategic east-central Caracas area, where hooded  students burned a soft drink company truck, and in secondary  schools and higher education institutions in central and  southwestern Caracas.    Capital city firefighters showed up to extinguish the fire  caused by the truck torching at the UCV and members of the  metropolitan police special brigade fired tear gas at the  students, who responded with rocks.    The disturbances spread to the Fermin Toro Secondary school  in downtown Caracas and to the Caballero Mejias Higher Education  Center, in the populous area of La Yaguada, in the southwest,  where residents joined the action to protest utility problems.  The students protested against an increase in public  transportation fares, especially the student fare, and against a  sales tax although its implementation was postponed.    On 18 January the increase in transportation fares led to  violent student demonstrations in Puerto La Cruz, 220 km east of  Caracas, where classes at universities were suspended in the  wake of looting that led to the arrest of 100 persons, and in  Charallave, 50 km to the south. The student protest, which was  characterized by the burning of tires and closure of streets,  spread to Cumana, 350 km to the east, Maturin, 400 km to the  east, and to the Andean city of San Cristobal, 648 km to the  southwest.</p>

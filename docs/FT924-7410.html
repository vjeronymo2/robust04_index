			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Minister urged on technology grant THE British Radio and Electronic Equipment Manufacturers' Association has urged Mr Edward Leigh, technology minister, to reconsider his opposition to the European Commission's proposed Ecu850m (Pounds 691.5m) subsidy to television broadcasters. The association has written to Mr Leigh asking him to support the Commission's plan to help fund broadcasters' transition to wide screen and high definition TV production in order to kickstart Europe's high-definition television programme. Mr Leigh expressed strong opposition to the subsidy plan at a meeting of telecommunications ministers this summer.</p>

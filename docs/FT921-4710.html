			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Arts: Winning portraits - The John Player National Portrait Gallery award THE PORTRAIT Award came into being in 1980, when Imperial Tobacco and the National Portrait Gallery came together with a view to doing something to stimulate the practice of portrait painting, thought at that time to be in some decline, and to encourage young artists. So it was that an open competition for artists aged 40 years and under was proposed and agreed, with the winner to be commissioned to paint the portrait of a distinguished sitter, which the company undertook to present and the gallery to accept. Some 12 years on, we can see that it was this last consideration that was the masterstroke. The John Player Portrait Award established itself immediately and prominently in the annual fixture list, regularly attracting a large initial entry and a strong and varied final exhibition. Clearly young artists were active and positive in their response, if only to the prospect of winning a sizeable sum of money. There had been in fact no actual decline in the art of the portrait, but it was true that while the interest in the figure and figurative subjects in general was flourishing, there was some inhibition about the portrait qua portrait, as though it were a specialised and exclusive mystery. Not least of the Portrait Award's achievements has been the bringing back of the portrait itself into the normal run of the figurative painter's preoccupations, a problem or interest to be addressed like any other. John Player rounded off its sponsorship in 1989 with the tenth running of the Award, passing it on to British Petroleum under which it continues to prosper. But portrait commissions take time to accomplish, and the last of those that followed upon the 1989 competition, when two artists shared the prize, has only lately been completed and accepted into the collection. This last unveiling, of Tai-Shan Schierenberg's large portrait of the barrister and writer, John Mortimer, concentrated a few minds; the result is an exhibition of the commissions of the full ten years of John Player's involvement arranged to coincide with the acceptance of the new portrait (National Portrait Gallery, St Martin's Place WC2, until March 15). The useful catalogue summarises the competition year by year. With those last joint-winners, there were 11 winners in all, five of them women. It is remarkable how young so many of them were, one or two even still at art school. Two, admittedly, were in the last year of their eligibility, yet even so the average age was 28. Any survey of 11 is narrow enough, yet my own feeling is that it reflects the broader truth of the matter. The students and young artists in the submission were ever evident in strength, and it is no surprise at all that they should have come through. The prize was encouragement and the prospect of winning not too remote, for it soon became clear there was in the judging no hint of favouritism or 'buggin's turn'. But while such cash would seem a wonderful windfall, the full implications of the consequent commission might take a little longer to sink in. For here was the artist put very much on his mettle, with a distinguished personage to be confronted in the certain knowledge that the result would be come to rest in a permanent national collection. The challenge is one no true artist would refuse, but it is daunting and can inhibit. Not all the commissioned portraits are thus as fresh, perhaps, or as bold and striking, as the portraits that actually won the prize. Not a single artist has baulked at the undertaking, cut and run: all the works are thorough-going, honourable and effective - the National Portrait Collection, after all, was never one of masterpieces but of images of the great and good. Yet one does feel at times that a second run at it might have done the trick, or an essay on a smaller scale - the modern conventional acre of canvas holds true for the portrait as for painting of any other kind. That said, it is all the more gratifying to find this very last of the John Player commissions as strong and brave a work as any of them. Tai-Shan Schierenberg has indeed taken a large canvas and a bold, ambitious composition, with John Mortimer seated to the front before him, in the corner of the studio, and his own image, a presence looming and imprecise, in the large mirror that tilts off the wall behind the sitter's chair - a respectful nod towards Velasquez. The handling is openly expressionist, free and confident, even casual in certain passages, yet every element in the working and composition draws the eye to the subject's head and face, that comes clearly into focus in an admirable likeness. It is a great success.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Anglo-American attire no indication of sound links ANGLO-AMERICAN ties may be on a sounder footing, but this was not apparent from the politically conscious and correct neckwear worn by both sides on Wednesday, writes Jurek Martin in Washington. At their joint press conference, Mr John Major wore a proper Tory blue tie. His attendant aides - Sir Robin Renwick, the UK ambassador, Sir Robin Butler and Sir Roderick Braithwaite from Downing Street - were similarly attired. Ms Sarah Hogg wore a blue dress. But President Bill Clinton's tie was a shocking neo-socialist red. Vice President Al Gore, Mr Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, and Clifton Wharton, deputy secretary of state, all wore varying shades of red. Only Mr Ray Seitz, US ambassador in London, was neutral - a darkish polka dot. But his tenure is in doubt.</p>

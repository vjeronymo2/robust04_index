			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOHN TOWER'S NOMINATION  </P> <P> Based on personal experience, I have an offbeat reason for supporting the  confirmation of Tower even though he has been very thick with the defense  establishment for many years.  </P> <P> During the Korean War, while serving as personnel officer of a Naval station, I  had the additional duty of being in charge of the brig. Every one of my guards  had a long disciplinary record. The place ran perfectly because no one could  put anything over on those guys.  </P> <P> I am not impugning Tower in any way. I am just saying that a fox can guard a  chicken coop.  </P> <P> FLOYD A. OLIVER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Pharos offers enlightenment - In a nutshell Businesses unsure about the impact of the single European market might find a computerised advisory service launched by National Westminster Bank of help. Pharos, a computer program which can be used on IBM-compatible machines, builds up a profile of the user's business by asking a series of questions. It identifies the key single-market issues and produces proposals and advice on strategy and operations. The program covers issues such as tax, the environment, consumer protection, product standards and health and safety. It is designed for companies in the turnover range of Pounds 250,000 to Pounds 100m and does not require computing skills, NatWest says. Pharos is free to NatWest customers, to clients of accountants Ernst &amp; Young and members of the Confederation of British Industry, which jointly developed the program. Contact 0800 777888.</p>

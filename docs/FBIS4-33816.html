			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 9 Jun (NA) -- Cordoba Provincial  Governor Eduardo Angeloz today emphasized that the inclusion of  the runoff system in the constitutional reform means the  Radicals [Radical Civic Union -- UCR] "have placed themselves at  the doors of Government House." He believes that there may be  an "electoral readjustment" in light of a second round.    Angeloz stated that the runoff system gives the UCR "a  better  election chance than before," although he said it now depends on  whether the main opposition force "can recompose itself and  define an absolutely positive party on the basis of stability,  not on inflation, and on the basis of clear guidelines of  growth, security, and dialogue for the country."    The Cordoba governor and head of the UCR's Political Action  Commission (CAP) reiterated that the UCR is "an instrument that  is completely out of tune," adding that he has been given the  role of "tuner, seeking to get the orchestra together so that  its members can look each other in the eye and have room to  rehearse."    This morning, when talking to a radio station, he referred  to the presidential elections, saying: "We are trying to tune  the instrument to faithfully play the concert" in 1995.    Referring to the topic of federal coparticipation, he  indicated that it "is good because it lets one know how much of  the nation's cake is being eaten by each province."    He recalled that in 1987, when the Cordoba Province  Constitution was modified, he "tenaciously" opposed "a clause  that would have established how much the municipalities were to  participate in coparticipation."    He admitted he "was mistaken at the time," adding that he  believes the clause "helped to balance the social tensions  provoked by the municipalities because now they know that when  they draft their budgets, 20 percent of the corresponding  coparticipation is shared out among municipalities. They know,  therefore, what to expect."    Angeloz reiterated that the country's trade deficit, which  is  estimated to total $6 billion this year, is "a red alert." He  believes "the pillars of economic progress will begin to crack."    He said the government "has completely disregarded health  and  educational processes, tossing them to the provinces where there  has been a rise of about 500,000 unemployed following the  implementation of the convertibility plan and where poverty has  increased considerably."    "We, the provinces represented in the CAP, are affected,  pained, and concerned that the topics of education and health  are forgotten by the nation, including crises in many sectors  and regions of the country that are watching the map of poverty  expand," he added.    The head of the CAP, who on 8 June presided over its first  meeting, said: "One's attention is called to the possibility  that imports will amount to $20 billion, while exports will only  amount to $14 billion."    "There is a total lack of encouragement to achieve the  necessary hard foreign exchange for our exports and the tasks we  carry out abroad," he said.    Angeloz said the objectives of the new organization are "to  achieve a cordial atmosphere, to shorten distances, and to clear  proposals in order to reorganize the future of the party."    He asserted: "It will not become an organization parallel to  the party's National Committee," adding that its goal is  "harmony of proposals, conduct, and attitudes."</p>

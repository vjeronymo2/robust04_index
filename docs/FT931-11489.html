			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Graig independents reject Williams offer An offer for Graig Shipping from Idwal Williams has been rejected by independent directors as not reflecting sufficiently the true value of the company. They are not able to recommend it to shareholders, but discussions are continuing. They were advised by Close Brothers. Idwal Williams owns 50.45 per cent of the ordinary and 5.96 per cent of the A non-voting shares in Graig, and also manages its shipping and investment activities. It has offered 125p cash for the ordinary and 120p for the A, which represented premiums of 67 per cent and 62 per cent respectively over the share prices prevailing immediately prior to the announcement of an approach in early December. Yesterday the ordinary shares lost 9p to 129p while the A dropped 14p to 124p.</p>

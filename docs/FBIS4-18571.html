			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "`No' Kings?"] </F>   [Text] Following her indisputable election success of last  year, Center Party leader Anne Enger Lahnstein has been  unofficially crowned "no" queen in the fight against Norwegian  EU [European Union] membership. She may decline this sort of  compliment, but we cannot conceal the fact that this is a role  she fills a lot better than the yes side might have had reason  to hope. Far from excluding those not connected with the  farming sector, she has in fact served as a political magnet for  groups far removed from it.    Therefore, we raise an eyebrow or two at the concern now  voiced by Kjell Magne Bondevik, the Christian People's Party  leader, and Erik Solheim, his counterpart in the Socialist Left  Party. They say they fear Lahnstein's dominant position will  weaken the good cause since there will not be a no majority [in  the referendum] if the farmers are the only ones wanting to keep  Norway out of the EU. Without a trace of the modesty so  strongly warranted in this situation, they say that the no side  would be better off if the two of them were allowed center  stage.    The two party leaders have chosen a strange way to express  this concern. Their method speaks less of shrewdness than of PR  hunger. Of course it is no fun to remain in the shadows when  the sun is bathing another leader in its light. Messrs.  Bondevik and Solheim do, however, have a chance of getting a  place in the warm, desirable light of politics. They can  accomplish this by quitting their worrying and whining and  instead use a little energy to develop some thoughts on where a  Norway outside the EU will stand globally and in the Nordic  context. We are all most interested in this question that  appears to be quite the intellectual challenge for the two of  them.</p>

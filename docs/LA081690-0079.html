			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: PORT HUENEME;  </P> <P> RESIDENTS' PETITION PROTESTS TENT JAIL  </P> <P> Homeowners opposed to construction of a tent jail for drug users at the Navy  base in Port Hueneme have sent a petition with 764 signatures protesting the  project to the base commander.  </P> <P> Capt. R.J. Pearson III, commander of the Naval Construction Battalion Center,  received the petition, spokeswoman Connie Taylor said.  </P> <P> "Our position is that the proposal is under study," she said, and a decision on  the jail will be made in Washington.  </P> <P> Copies of the petition were sent to the Ventura County Sheriff's Department and  to County Supervisor John K. Flynn, said Mary Conklin, a member of the  Concerned Citizens Committee.  </P> <P> The temporary jail was proposed by Sheriff John V. Gillespie as a way to  provide space for as many as 320 minor drug offenders who would be housed in  four large tents.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, the County Board of Supervisors voted to ask the U.S.  Department of Justice for $7.2 million to launch the project.  </P> <P> Members of the committee that circulated the petition say they are concerned  about the jail's closeness to houses and three elementary schools.

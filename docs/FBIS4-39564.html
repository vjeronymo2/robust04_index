			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report in the "Non-Stop Around the Clock" </F> column: "Gaydar Has Breached an `Iron Curtain'"]    [Text] The day before yesterday Boris Yeltsin and Yegor  Gaydar had an eye-to-eye meeting. MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS asked  Yegor Timurovich for details. The Russia's Choice leader said  that they had discussed the general political situation in the  country and problems related to the package of economic edicts  both already signed by the president and those that will come  out shortly. During their confidential meeting they also  discussed the formation of the Russia's Choice party, in which  the president is taking an "interest." Chances are that Yeltsin  will not attend the Choice founding congress on 12 June but,  according to Gaydar, he relates positively to Russia's Choice,  and the formula "Russia's Choice is the party the president  leans on" is still in force.    Just a few months ago democratic leaders were complaining  about the Yeltsin apparatus, which "closed" the president to  contacts. Now, however, Yegor Timurovich noted, "the situation  is developing in an extremely positive way."</p>

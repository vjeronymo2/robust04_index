			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Europe - The Jobs Crisis: Unemployment in Europe Europe's unemployment rate is heading for post-war highs, with the OECD forecasting that it will hit 12 per cent next year. In response governments are unveiling jobs initiatives in part familiar and in part radical, with policy-makers no longer able to rely on economic growth, FT writers report. ACROSS EUROPE more than 22m people are out of work. Employers are cutting jobs by the tens of thousands, propelling unemployment towards post-war highs. By next year, the rate in Europe* will touch 12 per cent against a previous high of 11.2 per cent in 1986, the OECD says. In recent weeks, several governments have unveiled policy initiatives to tackle the crisis. Some are familiar from earlier waves of high unemployment. Italy, Norway and Denmark, for example, are bringing forward spending on public infrastructure, with the primary aim of employing construction workers. But there is much that is new in both the nature of the problem and the responses to it. Policy-makers in the 1990s are being forced to seek radical solutions at a time when there is little evidence they can rely on economic growth, as in the past, to reduce unemployment significantly. 'In most European countries, the proceeds of economic growth in the past 20 years have essentially been appropriated by those who have remained in employment. The unemployed have been excluded,' says Professor Paul Ormerod of the University of Manchester. In Spain, the economy virtually doubled in size in real terms between 1970 and 1992 but employment fell by 2 per cent in the same period, Prof Ormerod points out. Other European economies have shown similar trends. According to the professor, the growth in output and employment from 1970 to 1992 was respectively: Germany, 70 per cent and 8 per cent; France 75 and 7; Italy, 84 and 8; Britain, 52 and 3. How are policy-makers responding? In much of continental Europe and at the European Commission there is a growing awareness that a new balance needs to be struck between regulation which protects securely employed 'insiders' and deregulation in favour of the unemployed 'outsiders'. European Commission officials and governments in countries such as France and Spain stress that this does not mean the abandonment of worker protection. Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, says his government will not use the recession as an excuse to destroy France's system of social protection. But governments and EC officials are examining ways in which distributional goals can be achieved which minimise negative effects on employment. One way this can be done is by reducing the cost of employment by switching some non-wage labour costs from employers to the state. France, Norway and Belgium have recently chosen this path. Several governments - Spain, Italy and Germany - are also involved in varied attempts to limit pay rises in the hope that pay restraint will create jobs. More radically, some countries such as Spain and Italy are trying substantially to increase labour market flexibility. That means, for example, making it far easier to sack workers, many of whom have in effect a job for life. In Spain it looks as if a compromise might be possible which involves reducing the cost of sacking established workers in return for tougher restrictions on the use of temporary contract workers. But throughout Europe, with the exception of the UK, labour market reform to improve employment will not be imposed by governments but will be negotiated through the established institutions of social partnership. *Figures for OECD Europe, excludes former Soviet Union.</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa sharply higher A sharp rise in Johannesburg industrials, and particularly index stocks, was attributed to the IFC's launch of new stock indices for South Africa, although late profit-taking left many prices off their highs. One analyst said the IFC move gave a fillip to futures trading and that the bullish tone also spilled over to otherwise lacklustre gold issues. Recent, good company results, with more to come, were another positive factor. The overall index rose 102 to 5,839, industrials gained 133 or 2.0 per cent at 6,738 and golds picked up 16 to 2,257. De Beers advanced R4.50 to R101, while Anglos added R5.25 at R243. SAB finished R5.25 higher at R100 after hitting a new peak for the year of R105 ahead of expected strong half-year results due next week. Amcoal rose R5 to R220, reflecting strong first-half earnings and a bullish outlook.</p>

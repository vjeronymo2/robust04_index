			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Diary of a Private Investor: When shareholders are caught bang to rights - Kevin Goldstein-Jackson casts a questioning eye over this year's plethora of issues and their merits THUD. Another rights issue document falls through my letter box. So far this year, there seems to have been a plethora of them. In January, my wife was invited to increase her very small shareholding in Burton Group by taking up her one-for-four rights entitlement at 60p a share. Reading the document, it seemed that the money raised would be put to good use: refurbishing many of the group's stores and reducing borrowing levels. The company was also cutting 933 staff employed in 'head office functions.' In our wanderings around shopping centres, my wife and I had commented already on some of the dreary-looking Top Shop and Dorothy Perkins stores; it must be hoped that the money to be spent on them will encourage more customers. But we also liked the group because of its flair for marketing: almost every week, it seems to find some excuse for another heavily-promoted sale in its Debenhams stores. My wife's shareholding in the group entitles her to a 12.5 per cent discount on all purchases at the group's shops, which also include Principles and Champion Sport. This encourages shareholder loyalty. My wife's decision to buy the rights issue shares has so far proved profitable, as Burton's shares are now more than 80p. Much less appealing was Lonrho's three-for-10 rights issue in February at 85p a share. It seemed to me that this was pitched at such a level as to enable Dieter Bock, a substantial new shareholder in the company, to increase his stake through underwriting part of the issue. Although I have made some good profits over the years from buying and selling Lonrho shares, the share price fluctuations in recent times have been too much. My holding at the time of the rights issue was, therefore, minimal. But the imminent sale of The Observer newspaper (owned by Lonrho) to the Guardian and the rise in the price of gold (Lonrho has a 45 per cent stake in the huge Ashanti gold mine in Ghana), plus Bock's influence on the group's German activities, have made me wonder if Lonrho is due for a re-rating. The company has many other interests, and I shall be monitoring it closely before deciding whether to increase my holding through the market. In April, I received details of rights offerings from three companies: Davis Service Group, Sycamore Holdings and Television South West (TSW). I have not taken up any of them; indeed, the details have persuaded me to dispose of my holdings in two of those companies. I bought shares in Davis for my personal pension scheme in February this year, paying 205p apiece in anticipation of good results in March. And Davis did announce good results: profits were up by more than Pounds 3m and the shares rose to 230p. On April 7, though, the company sent shareholders details of a vendor placing and open offer of almost 17m new shares at 205p - plus news of its proposed acquisition of HSS Higher Service Group from Mowlem. The cost of this was Pounds 52m - which I thought rather high for a company hiring out small plant, tools and equipment. HSS appears to have net assets of less than Pounds 7m and had an operating profit (before interest charges and tax) of only Pounds 4.765m for the December 31 1992 year-end. So, I sold my Davis shares for 229p. I could well be proved wrong but, in these days of continuing uncertainty in the markets, I prefer to err on the side of caution. Sycamore seems to be making a habit of rights issues. My pension scheme took up its two-for-one offer in September 1990 at 10p, and I hoped the company's new management team would improve performance. In June 1991, Sycamore made an open offer to shareholders of 17 new ones for every 20 held at a price of 19p. The company proposed using the proceeds to fund a number of acquisitions including Warwill, a foundry and engineering company. By this time, I had reduced my holding substantially as I did not share directors' hopes for Sycamore's immediate prospects. Some of its products - particularly garden furniture - appeared increasingly unattractive compared with rival products. And I was not keen on the foundry business. Thus, by the time of this April's two-for-five rights issue at 5p, my pension scheme had very few Sycamore shares left. What I read in the rights document caused me to sell the rest. As I had thought, its garden furniture business had run into difficulties; these were explained away in the document as 'a combination of poor summer weather and depressed consumer demand.' And, for the six months to December 31 1992, Warwill, had losses of Pounds 581,000. Sycamore's other businesses were faring rather better, but the main reason for the rights issue was to reduce the company's borrowings as it had experienced 'considerable strain' on its financial resources. I decided the risk of maintaining my holding was too great; there were better investment opportunities elsewhere. As for TSW, a small ITV company that lost its franchise last year, I was its founder and, until January, 1985, the chief executive. At one time, I held 1.25m shares in it; now I have just 500, mainly for sentimental reasons. The board of the company seems to have been well rewarded for losing the franchise - and for committing the company to a lease until the year 2000 on expensive office accommodation in Knightsbridge (west London) which, the rights issue document points out, has now led to provisions of Pounds 2m. The chairman saw his salary increase to Pounds 149,000 in 1992 and the highest-paid director received Pounds 259,000 - up from Pounds 90,000 and Pounds 149,000 respectively for the 17 months to December 31 1991. TSW's one-for-six rights issue, at 47p, is for the company to transform itself into UK Safety, a safety footwear business. I thought the offer was unappealing. So, I have several questions: For what are the proceeds going to be used? Is there anything in the small print of the issue document that might cause concern? Will the existing directors of the company be taking up their entitlement? Is the issue likely to be a success, or will many of the shares be left with the underwriters - so that the price falls eventually to below the rights price? If the company was not having this issue, would I buy more shares in it at the issue price? If not, then why back the company further when I do not have 100 per cent confidence in it? The answers to these questions will determine my reaction to the issue.</p>

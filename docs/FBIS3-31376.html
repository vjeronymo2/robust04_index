			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From BTA press review] </F>   [Text] Sofia, February 16 (BTA) -- "NATO Aircraft Refuel  at Sofia," runs a front-page headline in the KONTINENT daily.  Citing a well-informed source, the paper says that "in the dead  period between 0200 and 0400 hours, NATO cargo planes refuel at  Sofia Airport." A Hercules plane was reportedly seen too.  According to the publication, people living in the  neighbourhoods around the airport have confirmed they have been  disturbed by "the unbearable noise of turbo-prop engines" for  two weeks now. An anonymous air traffic control expert  monitoring military and civil aircraft is cited as saying that  refuelling at Sofia Airport does not run counter to any  international agreement. He added that NATO found it less  expensive to refuel planes in Sofia, rather than at other  airports in the Balkans. There is no information about defence  supplies being loaded on NATO planes, Captain Tsvyatko Donchev,  head of the Defence Ministry Press Centre, told the paper.  According to KONTINENT, he neither denied nor confirmed the  reports about refueling NATO aircraft. Sofia Airport Director  General Khristo Donchev pointed out that no military or civil  airplane could land without permission by the Transport  Ministry's Civil Aviation Department. Kerosene tanks are  allowed entry only if accompanied by documents permitting it, he  is cited as saying. Mr. Donchev has no information about such  documents having been issued. "The silence of the Foreign  Ministry and the institutions concerned with the refueling of  NATO aircraft could be explained by Bulgaria's joining the  Partnership for Peace Plan, the framework document of which was  signed by President Zhelyu Zhelev the day before yesterday at  NATO Headquarters in Brussels," the paper writes in conclusion.</p>

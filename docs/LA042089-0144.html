			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> VIOLA AGREES TO 3-YEAR, $7.9-MILLION CONTRACT, THEN LOSES  </P> <P> One of the reasons given to explain Frank Viola's poor start this season was a  bitter contract-extension battle with the Minnesota Twins.  </P> <P> Just a few hours after agreeing to terms for a three-year, $7.9-million  contract -- similar terms to those recently negotiated by the Dodgers' Orel  Hershiser -- Viola made his fourth start.  </P> <P> Viola, one of baseball's best left-handers, improved considerably but still was  a little short.  </P> <P> Two outs from his first victory, Viola gave up a single to Keith Moreland, and  then Matt Nokes hit a two-run home run to give the Detroit Tigers a 3-2  victory, only their second in the last 15 games against the Twins.  </P> <P> At first, Viola rejected the Twins' $7.9-million offer. Then, he decided to  accept it. But General Manager Andy MacPhail, angered by the "havoc and  turmoil," withdrew the offer. Wednesday, owner Carl Pohlad became involved and  reinstated the original offer, which Viola accepted.  </P> <P> Viola, who won the AL Cy Young Award last season when he was 24-7 with a 2.64  earned-run average, went into Wednesday night's game with a 6.88 ERA. Although  he lowered it, he is 0-3.  </P> <P> Oakland 7, Seattle 5 -- Dave Stewart is off to a running start toward his third  consecutive 20-victory season.  </P> <P> There are three main reasons why the former Dodger, the ace of the Oakland  Athletics, is the majors' first four-game winner.  </P> <P> First, it's April; second, Dennis Eckersley, one of the game's best relievers  is around to bail him out, and, finally, the Seattle Mariners are his favorite  opponent.  </P> <P> Stewart didn't exactly pitch a gem at Seattle. But Eckersley was there to get  the final out. He has four saves, three coming in games Stewart has won.  </P> <P> Stewart has developed a knack for pitching just good enough to win --  especially in April. He gave up eight hits and four runs, then put the first  runner on in the seventh. He departed with a 7-3 lead, and four relievers made  it stand up.  </P> <P> Stewart, a strong-armed right-hander, was 6-0 last April and has won his last  13 decisions in April. He still has two more starts this month.  </P> <P> Also, the Mariners have difficulties against Stewart. He has nine consecutive  victories over Seattle and is 10-2 in his career against the Mariners.  </P> <P> It's somewhat surprising that Stewart is 4-0 and the A's are 10-6. Oakland has  been playing without power hitters Jose Canseco all season and Mark McGwire for  most of it.  </P> <P> The A's have to scratch and battle for runs. Terry Steinbach drove in three  runs off Seattle's best pitcher, Mark Langston, and Billy Beane, called up to  replace McGwire, went 2 for 3 and drove in two runs.  </P> <P> New York 4, Toronto 2 -- If they could spend more time in Toronto, the Yankees  probably could reach first place in the East.  </P> <P> But the Yankees, who swept the three-game series in their favorite park,  Exhibition Stadium, won't return until early August.  </P> <P> Veteran left-hander John Candelaria gave up four hits in seven innings to  improve his record to 2-1. He gave the Yankees their third consecutive  well-pitched game. The Blue Jays managed only four runs and 20 hits in the  three games against a pitching staff that, going into the series, had the worst  ERA in the league at 6.17.  </P> <P> The Yankees jumped on loser Jimmy Key (2-2) for three runs with two out in the  fourth. Don Slaught started the rally with a triple. After a walk, Tom  Brookens, Alvaro Espinoza and Roberto Kelly drove in runs with hits.  </P> <P> "This sweep should improve our outlook," said Candelaria, who got his 1,500th  strikeout. "When you do that against a club as good as Toronto, it has to make  you feel good."  </P> <P> Texas 5, Milwaukee 1 -- The Rangers' power attack prevailed again at Arlington,  Tex.  </P> <P> Pete Incaviglia, Julio Franco and Ruben Sierra hit home runs as the Rangers  improved to 12-2. Jamie Moyer, a refugee from the National League, raised his  record to 3-0.  </P> <P> Moyer allowed Gary Sheffield's 402-foot home run in the second inning. He gave  up four other hits in 6 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> Incaviglia's home run, which came with Franco on base in the sixth inning,  traveled 425 feet. Incaviglia also hit a sacrifice fly in the fourth to put the  Rangers ahead to stay.  </P> <P> Boston 8, Cleveland 4 -- Nick Esasky went 4 for 4, including a two-run home  run, at Cleveland to help Roger Clemens win on an off night.  </P> <P> Although he is 11-1 against the Indians, Clemens (2-0) lasted seven innings,  giving up eight hits and three runs and striking out three.  </P> <P> Baltimore 6, Kansas City 5 -- Phil Bradley's two-run single climaxed a four-run  sixth-inning rally at Baltimore that enabled the Orioles to pull out another  victory.  </P> <P> The Royals had taken a 3-2 lead in the sixth when Bo Jackson hit a three-run  homer. It was Jackson's fourth home run this season.  </P> <P> It was only the Orioles' second victory over the Royals in the last 18 games.  DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Leading Article: The gamble on UK pay A PAY POLICY by any other name would smell as foul. So, certainly, employees in the public sector are likely to feel. The government is gambling on the docility of the public sector and the common sense of the private sector. But this government likes gambling. The question is whether the government manages at last to win a bet against what look like long odds. The Pounds 1.5bn saved by the government's limit of 1 1/2 per cent on public sector pay increases is the most significant covert tax measure in the chancellor's autumn mini-budget, equivalent to a little less than 1p on the basic rate of income tax. But it is also a potentially highly unpopular, selective control on the pay of about 30 per cent of those in employment. Any selective pay policy is open to objection as distorting and unfair. In his Autumn Statement, Mr Lamont argued in justification that the earnings of public sector employees had risen 20 per cent over the past two years, as against 13 per cent in the private sector. But this represents catching up, since average weekly earnings in the private sector had risen by 14 per cent relative to those in the public sector between 1981 and 1990. What the chancellor could have also said is that the government is inescapably responsible for pay in the public sector and that attempts to impose an economy-wide pay ceiling would have created far bigger problems. While the latter point is true, it makes it no less necessary for the private sector to follow suit if the dangerous combination of increasing resentment and decreasing competitiveness is to be avoided. The chancellor did not, in fact, make much of the role of wages in the hoped-for recovery. He remarked only that 'if the gains in competitiveness from the recent fall in the exchange rate are not to be lost it is vital that all employers keep tight control over their pay bills. The public sector cannot be sheltered from the difficulties faced by the private sector, where pay awards are now the lowest in a generation.' Large increase While the last point is true, the underlying increase in earnings in manufacturing was still as high as 6 per cent over the 12 months to September. Deflated by the retail price index (less mortgage interest), this is a real increase of 2 per cent. So large an increase in real wages after more than two years of recession seems extraordinary and depressing. More encouragingly, earnings increases have ceased over the last six months, after a 3 per cent surge in March. Should that performance be maintained, the chancellor will have won his gamble. Is this likely and why does it matter? It is not likely because pay settlements continue to hover at around 4 per cent, where they have been for much of the past year. This suggests earnings growth will remain quite high. It matters because reductions in the real cost of labour are needed if the UK is to sustain strong recovery, especially after a devaluation. Early recovery The slight decline in output of manufacturing over the three months to September, reported yesterday, underlines the importance of early recovery. But where is it to come from? The answer is that it must come, in part, from exports. The Treasury forecasts the real growth of exports of goods and services at 5 1/2 per cent between 1992 and 1993. But this will be particularly difficult when, as it notes, economic growth in the Group of Seven industrial countries is expected to remain sluggish next year. The point can be put in another way. The UK is in recession. This means, as Keynes taught, that the desire of UK residents to accumulate savings is leading to reduced output. But the UK also has a current account deficit, which is forecast by the Treasury at 2 1/2 per cent of GDP next year. So, despite their desire to save more, UK residents are still spending more than they are earning and borrowing the difference from abroad. This combination seems absurd. What is needed, instead, is for the currently fruitless desire for more savings to be turned into an actual reduction in the need to borrow from abroad. This can only be done if it becomes much easier for slack domestic resources to be turned both into exports and import substitutes. That, in turn, demands improved competitiveness and greater profitability in the production of tradeable goods and services. But if profitability is to grow strongly in the production of tradeable goods and services after a devaluation which will certainly raise the prices of inputs, wages need to rise more slowly than the growth of productivity in these sectors. Further decline in the rate of increase in nominal wages, combined with restraint on the growth of domestic demand, is what the UK needs for sustained recovery. Continued monetary control and tighter fiscal restraint will be needed to restrain demand. The government must show it can provide them. But determination is also needed on wages. It is now up to management in the private sector to show it possesses this quality. Only if it does so will the government win its bet.</p>

			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> TOUR BOAT HITS SAND; 14 HURT  </P> <P> A Colorado River tour boat rammed a sand bar, tossing passengers from their  seats and injuring 14 of 44 on board, authorities said. None of the crew or  passengers on the two-hour sightseeing tour out of Laughlin, Nev., appeared to  have life-threatening injuries, said San Bernardino County sheriff's spokesman  Jim Bryant. The injured were taken to Needles Desert Community Hospital. The  boat was on a tour that normally leaves Laughlin, turns around under the London  Bridge in Lake Havasu City, Ariz., and returns to Laughlin. The boat, about 50  feet long, is owned by Laughlin River Tours Inc., said a company official who  refused to give her name or comment further. "They got down there and were  coming back. The water is low now. The captain saw the sand and sped up the  vessel to lift the boat over the sand bar," Bryant said. "But it didn't lift.  It was going a pretty good speed. The people on board in chairs got tossed  around like ballast," Bryant said.  </P></p>

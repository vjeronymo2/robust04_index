			<p>BFN     [Text] Although conditions for a market economy were  created in Russia last year, economic restructuring was  virtually ineffective. This is evident from a report, entitled  "Comprehensive Analysis of the Situation in Russia and  Developments Forecast," drawn up by the Center for Social and  Strategic Studies and presented at a news-conference in Moscow  on Tuesday.    The report says that scientific research and high technology  development has shrunk by 73 percent over the last two years  while industry has been increasingly oriented on raw material  output. The percentage of fuel, energy, metal, and chemicals in  industrial production costs soared to 50 percent in 1993 from 30  percent in 1989-1991 whereas the share of machinery and consumer  goods dwindled from 44 percent to 28 percent.    "Industrial decline is underway with an explicitly one-sided  trend toward raw material production," the report underlines.    The government's economic policy last year is described as  "the continuation of reforms without macroeconomic  stabilization." The cabinet's strategy to bridge the budget  deficit through reduced state expenditures proved ineffective.    Although efforts to keep the budget deficit within 10  percent  succeeded this year, in fact this gap has proved larger than the  officially announced deficiency since some profits and  liabilities, like foreign loans and payment of interest on state  debt, have been inaccurately declared.    Experts believe that there can be no talk of any national  development unless the ruling political elite consolidates  itself.    At the same time, they point to the problem of political  terror in Russia. In their opinion, last year's series of  murders of bankers was politically motivated.</p>

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Arts: Iphigenie en Tauride - Opera The English Bach Festival production of Iphigenie en Tauride received high praise on this page last year - Max Loppert called it 'the peak of EBF achievement in recent years'. So it was appropriate that the company's 30th anniversary, celebrated at the Royal Opera House on Sunday, should have been marked by a repeat staging of Gluck's penultimate opera. The revival brought one major change of cast: the baritone Francois Le Roux as Orestes. He is a stylish singer, with (naturally) fine French delivery - a pleasure to listen to. The other principals were returning, and it was no less a pleasure to encounter Jennifer Smith's freshly voiced Iphigenia. Her flexible, well-projected soprano conveyed the music's myriad moods - most affecting was the way she plumbed the depths of despair in her lament 'O malheureuse Iphigenie]'. Andreas Jaggi was an accomplished Pylades who used his smallish tenor deftly; only the bravura demands of 'Divinites des grandes ames' defeated him. Donald Maxwell was incisive as the tyrant Thoas, and Fiona Rose's Diana was effective in her climactic last-act entrance. The company is fortunate in having the services of the energetic conductor Marc Minkowsky, a specialist in this genre. His was a dramatically paced account, light and crisp. The period orchestra sounded thrilling at Covent Garden, limpid in the opening minuet, biting in the palpitating accompaniment prior to Orestes's nightmare, raspy in the Janissary effects which Gluck deploys for the Scythian dances. English Bach Festival's approach to works of this period is justly acclaimed, and accords well with the heroic style of Gluck. Alain Germain's production is a breathtaking spectacle, complete with ballet (choreography by Stephen Preston) and costumes (by Terence Emery) based on late-18th century models. It is much more than a 'concert in costume', even if at times it does not wholly capture the turmoil Guillard's libretto suggests - the Act 4 recognition scene seemed restrained. Perhaps in its serenity the staging echoes Gluck's poignant use of major keys in denoting terrible grief. The work contains so much inward psychological action that it can lend itself to expressionistic treatment at the hands of 'concept' producers - and at least this period-conscious staging preserves its timeless quality. The virtues of Iphigenie en Tauride are sung more frequently than the opera itself, so it is a pity that this performance was a one-off. The production will be given twice at next month's Athens Festival.</p>

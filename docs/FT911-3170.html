			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / (CORRECTED) Vickers and BAe held back by drop in demand for cars Correction (published 30th April 1991) appended to this article. DEPRESSED car markets are affecting performance at Vickers and British Aerospace, the UK defence and automotive groups. The chairmen of both companies warned yesterday that interim profits would be below 1990 levels. Vickers shares slipped 2p to 209p; BAe's were down 6p at 612p. Sir David Plastow of Vickers said that the first half would be 'particularly difficult' due to reduced car sales and redundancy costs. Responding to questions at the group's AGM, he said that first-quarter sales of Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars were down by 'about 50 per cent.' Vehicle sales since January totalled 1,049. The group, which said its other businesses were performing satisfactorily, is expected soon to receive a long-awaited order for 100 to 200 Challenger 2 tanks for the British army. Professor Roland Smith of BAe, owner of the Rover Group, said that interim results would fall short of 1990 levels 'despite the strong performance of our defence companies.' Correction (published 30th April 1991). A total of 1,049 Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars were sold in thefirst quarter of 1990, and not in the first three months of this year, as stated in the Financial Times of April 26.</p>

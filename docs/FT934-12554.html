			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Approaches for Porter division Porter Chadburn, the packaging, consumer products and specialist distribution group, said it had received 'one or two approaches' for its consumer division businesses. However, Mr Raymond Dinkin, chief executive, said that weekend press reports suggesting the company was about to unveil a rescue package involving the sell-off of its British interests were 'pretty speculative'. Porter Chadburn reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 3.62m for the year to April 2 and last month warned that profits for the half year to September would, on a like-for-like basis, be 'well down on last year'. The shares, which have fallen from a high of 42p this year, were unchanged at 20p.</p>

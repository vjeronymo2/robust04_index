			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Washington downbeat on Gatt breakthrough: Hope still alive in Brussels as EC-US summit offers last chance for a 1992 Uruguay Round settlement THERE are still hopes in Brussels that tomorrow's EC-US summit in Washington could deliver the breakthrough needed for a Uruguay Round deal liberalising broad new swathes of world trade. However, the mood in Washington yesterday was downbeat. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, accompanied by Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, prime minister of Portugal, which currently holds the EC presidency, are meeting President George Bush in what is widely seen as the last chance this year to get a new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The US presidential election campaign is likely to impede further attempts to get a deal before a new administration takes office in January. Even if a political agreement is reached this week, it will take at least two months to resolve the details. Brussels was last week talking down prospects of success. After more than five years of negotiations, missed deadlines and megaphone diplomacy, plus the past six months of false dawns, Commission officials are understandably prudent and tight-lipped. But some senior Brussels officials genuinely believe a deal is within reach, and that public caution is simply to magnify the achievement. The key to an overall agreement remains an EC-US understanding on farm trade subsidies, which all sides believe is vital to unlock progress on remaining differences over services liberalisation and market access. There have been strong hints, but no firm evidence, that the US is willing to allow EC subsidies to farmers as compensation for heavy price cuts Brussels plans as part of its farm reform plan. The conditions are likely to be that the Community furnishes proof that the compensation scheme restricts production, and that the payments start falling after six years. The EC has maintained it cannot meet Gatt subsidy reduction targets, and that reform of its Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is at risk, unless Gatt allows these payments into its 'green box' for subsidies which do not distort trade. The political core of this issue, however, is the extent to which the EC can offer open-ended guarantees of a livelihood to its hard-pressed smaller farmers. Some Brussels officials also believe that the EC could agree to restrain the volume of its subsidised exports - in addition to even higher cuts on the amount of subsidy - as long as the US restrains exports of corn gluten, a cheap cereals substitute for animal feed. The price of cereals, the US's main target for subsidy cuts, is due to be cut by 30 per cent over three years under CAP reform, well over the Gatt target of 20 per cent internal subsidy cuts over six years. But byproducts, such as corn gluten, can undercut even the lower price level. The EC also wants export subsidies cuts to fall on sectors rather than products. Otherwise, high-added-value products such as cheese, in the dairy sector, would be hit in the same way as, say, skimmed-milk powder. Reports that the preliminary meeting last week in London produced no progress has, however, depressed expectations in Washington. Mr Cal Cohen, vice-president of the Emergency Committee for American Trade, said no deal on agriculture was possible unless the EC agreed to limit the tonnage of its subsidised exports. However, there is new talk of 'bundling' the agriculture and services negotiations to exchange EC concessions on agriculture for US concessions on services. Finally, the EC is holding out for a 'peace clause,' through which the US would undertake to set aside use of its trade law arsenal and settle bilateral disputes through Gatt. It is unclear whether the EC would settle for the generally improved bilateral trade climate that a Uruguay Round settlement would bring.</p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Books: The primrose path to the pinnacle of power - The British Establishment is a self-perpetuating oligarchy serviced by England's two ancient universities THE OXBRIDGE CONSPIRACY by Walter Ellis Michael Joseph Pounds 15.99, 340 pages There is nothing inherently wrong with elites. Every country has them: in some, they are an asset; in others, a distinct drawback. Successful elites in the modern world tend to be open to meritocracy, drawn from a reasonably broad spectrum of society, dedicated to wider goals than just their own privilege and social status, educated and experienced in what makes a dynamic market economy tick. America's movers and shakers come closest to this ideal, as do the elites of post-war Germany and Japan, to varying degrees. At the other extreme are those elites which remain closed and narrowly drawn, usually from a few wealthy families, hostile to free-market democracy which would challenge their entrenched privilege, dedicated to exploiting the masses whom they treat with contempt, rather than empowering or enriching them. The kleptocracy of Haiti provides a contemporary example of this sort of elite. The British Establishment falls somewhere between the American and Haitian extremes: less broadly based, meritocratic or successful than its American counterpart, more so than the Haitian one. Increased social mobility has made the British elite more open to meritocratic advance than it was 100 or even 50 years ago. What is remarkable, as Walter Ellis's book reveals, is just how much of an Oxbridge preserve it remains. Even I was surprised by the grip - in some cases the stranglehold - Oxbridge continues to have on the levers of power. Ellis shows that in the traditional areas - politics, the law, the civil service, the City and religion - Oxbridge graduates remain predominant in the top positions. The power of Oxbridge to place its people in plum posts has eroded a bit in some areas; but on present trends Oxbridge graduates will still dominate this nation 100 years from now. Ellis also shows, more startlingly, that even in less traditional areas, such as the media and popular entertainment, Oxbridge also enjoys a preeminence. The BBC and the broadsheets are Oxbridge bastions. Ellis is kind enough to write that as editor of The Sunday Times I have employed journalists 'of every background and none.' But even the only other broadsheet, daily or Sunday, edited by a non-Oxbridge man, The Independent on Sunday, is dominated by Oxbridge types. Senior editors at the Telegraph newspapers and the Financial Times are also almost overwhelmingly Oxford or Cambridge men. Snooty Oxbridge has now infiltrated even popular culture. British comedy in the Morecambe and Wise era used to have strong roots in the working class. Since Monty Python days it has gradually been taken over by Oxbridge: the wave of 'alternative' comedians of the 1980s who have now become mainstream 'luvvies' is largely Oxbridge. Even our literature has been colonised. Shakespeare, Dickens, Eliot, Scott, Austin, the Brontes - they all owed nothing to Oxbridge. But today's literary mafia is an Oxbridge near-monopoly. Apologists for Oxbridge, and they are already mustering to savage this book, will argue that none of this matters: Oxbridge graduates are simply the best and the brightest ('I don't see why 2 per cent shouldn't translate into 90 per cent,' says one Cambridge woman. 'Employers are looking for the top people of a generation, and they go to Oxford and Cambridge'); and, in any case, both universities are now part of the meritocracy - almost 50 per cent of their intake is from state schools. Both arguments are bogus. It is part of the insufferable pomposity and arrogance of so many Oxbridge types that its graduates dominate the pinnacles of power simply because they are the best. I have never found this to be the case. I never cared which university staff at The Sunday Times went to, and usually did not know. When, often in casual conversation, I learned their alma mater, it was rarely the case that the best had been to Oxbridge. As Ellis argues, many of Britain's best and brightest do not apply for Oxbridge in the first place, often because they think that socially they would not fit in. As a result the competition to get into other universities is often greater than it is to get into Oxbridge: at modest Nottingham, for example, there are six applicants for each place; the Oxbridge average is just three. What Oxbridge provides, however, is access, in the manner of a self-perpetuating oligarchy - the universities are, as Ellis puts it, 'the marshalling yard for the gravy train.' At The Economist, the Oxbridge-educated senior editors would regularly ask Oxbridge authors to send on their brightest students. High-flyers from Manchester or Leeds had no such privileged path. It is a special treatment for Oxbridge graduates that exists right across the British Establishment. The idea that the two ancient universities are part of meritocratic Britain is mere sophistry, at which Oxbridge folk excel. If 50 per cent of the intake is now from state schools, it means that over 50 per cent still comes from private schools which educate just 7 per cent of our children. They may be among the most privileged and best-educated; it does not follow they are innately the brightest. Moreover, as Ellis points out, even those from the state sector come overwhelmingly from the remaining grammar schools and shire comprehensives, themselves predominantly middle class. The way we waste the talents of those from less privileged backgrounds while overpromoting the mediocre from the middle classes is one of the disgraces of modern Britain; in that regard, Oxbridge is part of the problem, not the solution. Ellis has written a brave book that needed to be written, though in places it is rambling and repetitive and the research often seems skin-deep. It is also weak on analysing the confluence of class and culture that has kept Oxbridge predominant. For that, Professor Weiner's English Culture and the Decline of the Industrial Spirit remains the best text. The hegemony of the two universities would not matter if Britain was a great success story in the 20th century. But Oxbridge imparts to our elite values which, in their anti-commerce, anti-technology, anti-market snobbery, make them unfit to run a modern economy. It is the Oxbridge elite which has presided over the decline of this nation, and it lacks the ability or the temperament to reverse it. As Ellis writes: 'Britain under Oxbridge is a failed experiment.'</p>

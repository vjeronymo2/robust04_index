			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Sears, Roebuck to cut dividend for final period SEARS, Roebuck, the heavily loss-making US retailer, has cut its dividend for the first time in 60 years, with a 10 cents a share cut in the fourth-quarter payout to 40 cents, Reuter reports from Chicago. On Tuesday the company reported a loss of Dollars 10.72 a share for 1992, down from a profit of Dollars 3.71 the year before. Analysts said the widely anticipated cut would save about Dollars 140m a year. Sears said the move reflected the strategic repositioning of the company, including the spin-off of Dean Witter, its securities brokerage and investment banking unit and Discover, its credit card business, expected to take place in the middle of 1993.</p>

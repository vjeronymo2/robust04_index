			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 20 Jan (MENA)--AL-AHRAM newspaper affirms  that the available evidence on the al-Asad-Clinton summit in  Geneva indicates that it was a good step toward stimulating the  peace process, especially on the Syrian track, which has been  inactive lately.    In its editorial Friday, the paper says that this is the  first time that a genuine opportunity exists to normalize  relations between Syria and Israel and that the ball is now in  Israel's court. Israel, it adds, should respond to Syria's clear  and forthright willingness to normalize relations with that  country under a final peace accord. The paper calls on Israel  to declare whether it is prepared for a complete withdrawal from  the Golan.    In light of this, the paper notes, it can be said that the  al- Asad-Clinton summit has been successful and that it will  hold the door wide open for positive developments in the  negotiations in Washington next week. Accordingly, the paper  adds, we can say that 1994 will be a year of peace between Syria  and Israel, which deserves to be called the peace of the brave.</p>

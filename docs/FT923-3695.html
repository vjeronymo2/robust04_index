			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / International Company News: Canada's two main airlines to merge CANADA'S two main airlines have agreed to merge after months of off-and-on negotiations. PWA, parent of Canadian Airlines International, yesterday rejected proposals by its employees for a cash injection and wage cuts, leading to a close link with American Airlines. PWA's board said it had accepted a revised merger deal with Air Canada as announced on September 3. A holding company, to be owned 40 per cent by PWA's shareholders and 60 per cent by Air Canada's shareholders, will be set up to manage operations of both airlines. Air Canada's head office will remain in Montreal and Canadian's in Calgary. Each will have its own president and chief operating officer. Shareholders of both airlines will exchange their stock on a one-for-one basis for shares of the new holding company. Duplicate operations in international services will be eliminated and excess domestic capacity pruned. The holding company will set broad policy and provide certain common services. The existing maintainence bases at Vancouver and Montreal will be retained. Each airline will be represented equally on the holding company's board. The combined debt will be about USDollars 4bn, with long-term lease obligations of USDollars 2.5bn. Mr Hollis Harris, Air Canada president said the merger would bring 6,000 lay-offs out of a combined total workforce of 34,000 people. A group representing 80 per cent of Canadian's employees fought for the link with America, offering cash and pay reductions totalling nearly CDollars 500m (USDollars 420.1m). In August, Air Canada and a Texas financial group offered USDollars 400m for a restructured Continental Airlines. Air Canada has also proposed a commercial link with United Airlines and is searching for a European partner.</p>

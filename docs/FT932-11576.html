			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Yeltsin's enemies trip up with an own-goal TELEVISION pictures of Communist demonstrators charging Russian police on May Day are the latest contribution to a vigorous media campaign which is proving President Boris Yeltsin's most powerful weapon against his political opponents. After blaming the media for the president's referendum victory, the hardline opposition scored an own-goal on Saturday when up to 300 people were hurt during the first violent demonstration in Russia since the demise of the Soviet Union. Having relied on aggressive advertising and sympathetic coverage of the conflict with parliament to win last month's referendum, the Yeltsin camp has moved quickly to exploit what it described as a provocation by neo-Communists who could not cope with defeat. Almost every news programme over the weekend replayed footage of the violence. In an ironic twist, pensioners at the May Day rally included Mr Vladimir Kryuchkov, the former Soviet KGB chief who once accused pro-Yeltsin demonstrators of wanting to seize power and who is now facing trial for his part in the 1991 coup. Mr Sergei Filatov, the president's chief of staff, said hardline deputies who organised the demonstration had to bear responsibility for events. Suggesting there would be tough action to prevent a recurrence of violence, he said society had to prevent holidays being turned into a 'struggle with the people'. Mr Yevgeny Kiselyov, the respected TV journalist who interviewed Mr Filatov, described Sunday's violence as 'an attempt to achieve success by naked force on the part of those who suffered defeat in the referendum'. In defiance of any possible ban, the unrepentant National Salvation Front (NSF) has already announced a rally for May 9, the anniversary of the Soviet defeat of Nazi Germany. Mr Mikhail Astafiev, a deputy and NSF leader, described coverage of the weekend events as a 'falsification'. The media are motivated by a mixture of pressure from government paymasters and voluntary support, born of a perception of Mr Yeltsin as the lesser of two evils in the conflict with his opponents. Such a perception, for instance, motivates the pro-Yeltsin line of Izvestiya newspaper which has spent months fighting off attempts by Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary chairman not known to embrace press freedoms, to take it over. On Friday, Mr Khasbulatov, who blamed Mr Yeltsin's victory on media 'terror', disbanded parliament's media committee to rectify the 'Goebbels-style lies' of the president's media chief. Shorn of all members except for its chief, a deputy from the hardline Russian Unity bloc, the committee was accused of disobeying instructions to allocate air-time in proportion to the factions represented in the conservative-dominated parliament. Having started off with a distaste for anything smacking of Communist-style propaganda when Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar first launched radical economic reforms a year ago, the Yeltsin administration is now making full use of the media. It remains to be seen whether it will put its advantage to good use.</p>

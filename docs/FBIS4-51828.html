			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 3 KYODO -- The leader of New Party Mirai  (Future), a five-member group in the House of Representatives,  said Wednesday [as received] the next general election must be  conducted under a new electoral system that combines 300 single  seats and 200 others chosen through proportional representation.    In issuing a party statement, Michihiko Kano said the Diet  must enact a bill to delineate constituencies during the current  150-day regular session, which may be extended past the June 29  deadline in order to pass it.    New Party Mirai's statement countered calls from both the  ruling and opposition parties for an early dissolution of the  House of Representatives for a snap general election even under  the existing multiseat constituencies.    Kano and four others quit the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)  last month amid political unrest sparked by then Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa's April 8 announcement to resign. They formed  the new party on April 18.</p>

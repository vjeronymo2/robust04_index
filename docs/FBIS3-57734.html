			<p>Language: <F P=105>Armenian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Armenian Defense Ministry Press Service has  reported relative calm in all the border regions of Armenia  since last night.    The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense Army Headquarters has  reported that fierce battles are going on in the north of  Kelbadzharskiy Rayon, along the Seydlar, Chatly, and Kamyshly  line. The Azerbaijani side has sent a large force to the front  and, despite huge losses, is still trying to break through the  defensive line of the Karabakh fighters at any cost. The  Karabakh side first checked the relentless pressure before  launching a counter-attack, sending the enemy back. There are  losses on both sides. Casualty figures are being determined.    The situation is also tense in Mardakertskiy Rayon, where  fierce fighting is taking place near Tonashen.    Only positional exchanges of fire are occurring on the rest  of the war fronts.</p>

Although these talks are not being held in one room, the work  that is being done while these talks are being held is similar  to holding a general conference. Key figures in Hizballah have  been exchanging working papers and proposals about a specific  subject, namely Hizballah and the coming stage.    The same sources add that the discussion about the working  papers, which are being exchanged is focusing on what Hizballah  should do to overcome the critical deadlines that it will have  to face in the coming stage, that is, in the post-settlement  stage.    The dominant tendency in the party is advising the party and  telling it that to avoid becoming a victim of this coming stage,  it needs to adapt its intellectual, political, and security  concerns to the coming stage.    In this regard that tendency is setting forth the following  proposals:    First, a condition is to be created whereby Hizballah would  open its doors to the various Lebanese parties and sects so as  to prevent anyone from isolating the party on political or even  on security matters. To achieve that, broad national slogans  will have to be set forth, and these slogans will have to be  beyond the religious or the sectarian.    Second, a solution to the challenge facing the party is to  be  found in case continuing the resistance can no longer be  justified. It is the opinion of this tendency that letting the  resistance slogan live on is a matter that touches upon the  party's strategy and involves the party's strength and its  continued momentum. Accordingly, dropping the resistance slogan  for any reason whatsoever would weaken the party's political  propositions and undermine the continued rise of its popularity  among the ordinary classes. To put it briefly, Hizballah would  turn into a ritual-practicing religious society, and the  financial red tape within the party would grow. Over the medium  term Hizballah would be exposed to the danger of financial  scandals coming to light. [In this regard] Hizballah would  experience something like that that the Islamic condition in  Egypt experienced during the eighties.    In this regard this tendency is suggesting that the party  will have to accept that resistance operations, which are  launched from Lebanon, be frozen after the settlement, provided  the party maintains its commitment to the resistance slogan. And  yet, the party will have to do this according to a new strategy  based on putting Hizballah's resistance against Israel in the  hands of Hamas, thereby involving Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement] in coordinating, planning, and carrying out certain  kinds of security operations.    It is the opinion of this tendency that this strategy would  spare the party [the ordeal] of appearing to be alone and  vulnerable in rejecting the settlement. This tendency also  associates the resistance, which it sees as equivalent to  distinct political survival, with the survival of the Islamic,  Palestinian resistance.</p>

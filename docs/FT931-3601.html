			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Bombay Stock Exchange plans to resume trading today The Bombay Stock Exchange is planning to resume trading today and re-open sooner than expected in a bid to restore business confidence in India's commercial capital, writes Stefan Wagstyl. Trading will be carried out in a makeshift trading room set up over the weekend to replace a large new trading centre which has been destroyed. Trading will be limited to an hour. Exchange officials were persuaded to try to re-start today after meetings with Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, and Mr Sharad Pawar, the chief minister of Maharashtra state, which includes Bombay. Bombay police found and defused a bomb hidden in a scooter parked near a busy railway station in the city centre. The police said the scooter had not been moved since Friday and had probably been placed by Friday's bombers. Mr A S Samra, the city's police commissioner, said last night that police had questioned several people in connection with the bombings, but none was suspected of being involved, and no one had been detained.</p>

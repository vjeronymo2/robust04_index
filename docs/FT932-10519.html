			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Job figures show slow US growth US manufacturing employment declined for the second month running in April, suggesting continued weakness in the industrial sector, official figures indicated yesterday. Manufacturers shed nearly 90,000 jobs in March and April, more than offsetting job gains in the previous four months, the Labour Department said. Construction employment also fell last month, dashing hopes of a rebound after severe winter weather in March. Non-agricultural employment as a whole, however, rose a modest 119,000 to 109.3m, indicating that the economy is continuing to grow sluggishly after a lacklustre first quarter. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 7.0 per cent for the third month running against a peak of 7.7 per cent last summer. The figures fell short of Wall Street projections of an increase in non-farm of employment of 150,000-160,000 last month, in line with the average rate of expansion in the first quarter. The bias toward service industries was more pronounced than expected. Employment contracted by 79,000 in goods-producing industries and rose by 198,000 in service industries, continuing a trend established early in the recovery. Nearly a quarter of the net increase in employment last month was in the amusement and leisure industries. Healthcare and temporary service jobs accounted for most of the remaining new jobs. Mr William Barron, a senior labour department official, said the report pointed to a continuing 'slow improvement' in the labour market. Total employment, however, remains about 1m short of the pre-recession peak of 110.3m in June, 1990. Analysts took some comfort from a further increase in the length of the average working week, which suggests industrial production rose modestly last month. With factory overtime rates now at record levels, a pick-up in demand this summer could lead to a rapid rebound of employment.</p>

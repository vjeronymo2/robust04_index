"We are on a trajectory of better and better employment  figures, but they are still not as good as we hope," Labor  Secretary Robert Reich said today, saying that the new  legislation will change the entire employment system.    Observers said the Workforce Security Act, which features  the  establishment of one-stop job searching centers across the  nation, was the third piece of legislation of the White House in  improving the nation's job picture.    Last year, Congress passed the administration's voluntary  national standards for elementary and secondary school and its  school-to-work training and apprenticeship program.    In the U.S., around 25 percent of the unemployed workers do  not have the skills for another jobs. The traditional job  training system is called obsolete and wrongly targeted.    "What the Americans are discovering now, even though there  are more jobs, they're not getting the old jobs back again,"  Secretary Reich said in a TV interview. "It's not enough simply  to get some unemployment insurance check. You've got to get  help in getting the new jobs."</p>

			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GREENLINING: AN EQUAL-OPPORTUNITY, GRASS-ROOTS ANTIDOTE TO REDLINING;  </P> <P> ECONOMICS: WITH A LITTLE PRODDING, CORPORATE AMERICA IS FINALLY REALIZING THAT  IGNORING INNER-CITY COMMUNITIES IS COSTLY TO THE BOTTOM LINE.  </P> <P> Redlining is no stranger to minority communities. It's the equivalent of  whites-only baseball played by America's corporations and businesses.  "Greenlining" aims to do to these communities what Jackie Robinson did to  baseball.  </P> <P> Like the "Green Power" movement, which appeals to corporate self-interest to  protect the environment, the Greenlining Coalition aims to promote the economic  well-being of minorities and the poor by encouraging corporate America to  abandon redlining and form partnerships with them. Why should corporations,  after years of cold-shoulder treatment, embrace inner-city and low-income  communities? Profits and market share.  </P> <P> Started in 1979, the Greenlining Coalition comprises 16 multiethnic  organizations, among them the California Council of Urban Leagues, the League  of United Latin American Citizens, the Filipino-American Political Assn. and  Consumer Action. Its first partnership, also in 1979, was with Glendale Federal  Savings and Loan. The coalition agreed not to file an action with the Federal  Home Loan Bank Board to block Glendale's merger with another S&amp;L. In  return, Glendale pledged to develop inner-city lending programs, name minority  and female representatives to its board of directors and revise its  philanthropic policies.  </P> <P> Its most recent partnership was announced last month when Security Pacific Bank  said it was committing $2.4 billion in the 1990s to economic development in  inner-city and low-income neighborhoods. The bank also plans to retarget its  philanthropic contributions to reflect the needs of its customer base, almost  half minority. The program is the result of numerous meetings of the coalition  and its counsel, Public Advocates, with Security Pacific's chief executive  officer, Robert Smith.  </P> <P> Other banks also recognize the immense profits to be made by lending in the  inner cities. The Bank of Tokyo, which owns 77% of Union Bank, reached a  comprehensive equal-opportunity agreement with the coalition in 1988 to head  off a potential legal challenge to its plan to merge with a California bank.  The pact calls for the bank to invest at least $42 million a year in the inner  city, to name a total of five minority and female representatives to its board  of directors, to set up a comprehensive multilingual outreach program and to  offer free checking accounts to the poor. As part of the bank's lending  program, the Baltic Inn in San Diego was restored and the Mercy Family Plaza in  San Francisco built to create housing for low-income and senior citizens.  </P> <P> Commendable as Bank of Toyko's action is, Southern California Edison recently  went further. Last September, after a series of Supreme Court decisions that  made it more difficult for plaintiffs to prove discrimination and weaken the  quota system, Howard Allen, Edison chairman, asked the coalition to join him in  announcing corporate changes that would strive to end economic exclusion.  </P> <P> The power company promised to add two female and minority representatives to  its board of directors, ensure that 30% of its top management be minority and  female, award roughly 30% of its $1 billion year in contracts to minorities and  women and increase by tenfold its direct philanthropic contributions to the  poor and minorities.  </P> <P> Allen has been outspoken on the matter of equal opportunity, asserting that it  is not only morally right, but makes good business sense and can be achieved on  merit alone.  </P> <P> Other major corporations have also pursued the profit potential of serving all  segments of California's diverse population. In 1986 and 1987, AT&amp;T, GTE  and Pacific Bell entered into agreements with members of the coalition to  provide multilingual telephone services. One expert estimated that the  introduction of full Spanish-language telephone services could increase Pacific  Bell's revenue by at least $5 billion this decade. AT&amp;T, impressed by the  profitability of Spanish-language telephone services, has announced that it  will voluntarily launch a 140-language phone service throughout the United  States.  </P> <P> The Greenlining Coalition has been less successful in dealing with  foreign-owned banks and the insurance industry in California. Unwillingness to  lend to minorities in California has prompted legal protests by the coalition,  Consumers Union and Communities for Accountable Reinvestment. As a result, the  Federal Reserve Bank is scrutinizing the lending practices of Mitsui Bank Ltd.  of Japan.  </P> <P> Far more notorious are the exclusionary business practices of the insurance  industry. Two of the state's largest insurance companies virtually refuse to  sell auto insurance in minority areas of Los Angeles. This has spawned  administrative legal suits by Consumers Union, Voter Revolt and the Greenlining  Coalition. Partly as a result, Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie will  hold hearings next month on redlining.  </P> <P> But the practices of the insurance industry are increasingly out of step with  more and more economists, educators and CEOs who believe that California's  long-term economic viability depends on its business community developing  partnership with its minorities -- which will collectively be the majority by  the year 2000.  </P> <P> These minority-corporate ties are best developed voluntarily. But as the  civil-rights struggle has demonstrated, government incentives -- and penalties  -- are sometimes a helpful prod. Two of California's five largest banks --  Wells Fargo and Security Pacific -- currently have no minority representatives  on their boards of directors. The chairman of Security Pacific, however, has  pledged to have two minority board members by the end of the year. A typical  major bank or savings-and-loan has less than 1% of its loans in the  African-American community, less than 2% in the Latino.  </P> <P> That is why the coalition is asking Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) and  Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles) to sponsor legislation that would block any  takeover or merger unless the acquiring corporation can demonstrate its  commitment to equal opportunity. If passed, the legislation could break  corporate resistance to multicultural opportunity. Martin Luther King Jr.'s  dream of economic parity for minorities and corporate America's dream of  increasing market share and profitability could both come true.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBC FOLLOWS ABC WITH NEW AD POLICY  </P> <P> Stepping up pressure on advertisers, National Broadcasting Co. said Tuesday  that it would follow competitor ABC's lead and institute a new policy on how it  sets ad rates.  </P> <P> The networks are abandoning the old method of how they guaranteed audience  levels to advertisers because of what the networks claim are flaws in A. C.  Nielsen Co.'s "people meter" national ratings system.  </P> <P> Nielsen has come under fire from ABC, CBS and NBC because television viewership  declined sharply in the first quarter of the year and the ratings service has  not been able to explain the falloff to the satisfaction of the networks.  Nielsen maintains that it has inspected the system and can find nothing wrong  with it.  </P> <P> Although technically different from ABC's new policy, NBC nonetheless seeks the  same thing: to limit its liability from the steep falloff in viewers as  recorded by Nielsen earlier this year. The NBC decision will affect a big chunk  of the projected $4.3 billion in advertising time to be sold in the coming  weeks.  </P> <P> Until now, the networks used the previous season's ratings for a show to set  advertising rates for the upcoming year. Under the new system, NBC will use  data from the previous six years, when available, to set the rates.  </P> <P> All three networks are worried about the accuracy of the current Nielsen system  they might have to give advertisers hundreds of millions of dollars worth of  free advertising time if ratings do not measure up to expectations. Only the  fourth network, Fox, will guarantee the ratings of its shows based on the  method used in past years.  </P> <P> Larry Hoffner, executive vice president of network sales for NBC, called the  new policy an "interim solution" to the problem until a new measurement system  could be devised. "We recognize there has been a trend in declining viewing,  but what happened in the first quarter is larger than anything we've seen."  Predictably, NBC's announcement was no more enthusiastically embraced by  advertising agencies than ABC's decision had been the week earlier.  </P> <P> "The NBC plan builds in some anticipated decline," said Betsy Frank, director  of television and new media at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising Inc. in New  York. "But it's basically the same thing as ABC's."  </P> <P> Frank and other advertising agency executives say they are satisfied with  Nielsen's contention that the current "people meter" system is working  properly. The agencies contend that the networks are using the current  controversy to take the spotlight off their rapidly eroding market share.  </P> <P> Despite agency protests, however, there appears to be little that the agencies  can do. Network television is still the only medium that provides the broad  reach required of major packaged goods companies, and the alternatives, such as  cable or syndication, are not yet big enough to attract national-scale  advertising dollars.  </P> <P> But Hoffner acknowledged the confusion over new ad rates could extend the  negotiations for the purchase of advertising time weeks beyond the customary  July 4 wrap-up date. "It looks like a long summer," he lamented.  </P> <P> CBS is expected to announce its own ad rate policy by the end of the week.  </P></p>

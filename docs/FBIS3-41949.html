Tanyuk announced that according to his sources, "Kravchuk is  planning a big conflict with the parliament. The parliament may  be dissolved," he said. He believes that in such a situation  new parliamentary elections may not be held.    Ukraine signed the Moscow agreement "on its knees," said  Tanyuk. This agreement cannot be implemented because Kravchuk is  only planning to ask experts to make corresponding estimates.  Tanyuk described such actions as "anti-state," and carried out  under the pressure of forces which are not interested in  Ukraine's development.</p>

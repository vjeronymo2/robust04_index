Several comments were received from one respondent. Comments on aspects of the proposed notice which were not specifically proposed for public comment are not addressed in this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The respondent suggested a change in the funding priority proposed for applicants which demonstrate an increase in the percentage of graduates who have entered a Primary Care Residency for the most recent 3-year period. The respondent suggested that this priority be expanded to include awarding of the priority to applicants who have, during the most recent 3-year period, maintained a percentage of graduates entering a Primary Care Residency which substantially exceeds the average for all U.S. medical schools. This addition to the proposed funding priority would aid medical schools which may be maintaining a high percentage, i.e., 50&hyph;60 percent, compared to medical schools which may show a significant increase but start at a lower percentage, i.e., increase from 15 to 25 percent. It should be noted that an average percentage for all U.S. medical schools (osteopathic and allopathic) would most likely be lower than the 50&hyph;60 percent, example cited, and would not encourage schools to focus their efforts on increasing their percentage of graduates entering a Primary Care Residency. The second comment was related to the funding priority proposed for applicants which demonstrate an increase in the percentage of underrepresented minorities for the most recent 3-year period. The respondent suggested that for this priority the term ``minority'' should be used rather than underrepresented minority. The intent of this funding priority is to reward those applicants who show progress in reaching underrepresented minority populations. It is understood that data necessary to establish that specific populations or subpopulations are underrepresented in a specific discipline may not be readily accessible, or may differ in terms of data reported to medical school associations. Efforts were made in the application materials to assist applicants by allowing data to be presented in two ways, in a manner similar to that provided to their medical school association, or to present student applicant data related to the number and percent of minority population in the State where the applicant is based. All of the data on minorities presented by the applicants will be reviewed, recognizing that ``underrepresented minorities'' is defined for all applicants to this program in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the final funding priorities will be retained as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A funding priority be given to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

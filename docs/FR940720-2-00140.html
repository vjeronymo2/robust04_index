			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission also believes that it is reasonable for the CBOE to eliminate the provisions of CBOE Rule 24.17 allowing for automatic disqualification from RAES for failures to satisfy RAES obligations because the fees imposed for failing to meet participation requirements should provide a sufficient deterrent to ensure adequate market maker participation in OEX RAES. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  In this regard, the Commission notes that in addition to the graduated fees for failures to comply with the RAES log-on and log-off requirements, the proposal establishes a $500.00 fee for any member organization who logs onto RAES and later terminates participation on RAES prior to the next expiration cycle without participating in another OEX RAES account or terminating membership with the Exchange. The Commission believes that these fees should deter participating OEX RAES market makers from abandoning their commitment to RAES for other than good cause. Nevertheless, the Commission expects the CBOE to monitor OEX RAES participation and to consider altering the requirements should adequate participation not be maintained after these changes are implemented, particularly during periods of high volatility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission notes that under CBOE Rule 24.17(e)(i) the chairperson of the OFPC, in consultation with a senior Exchange executive officer, may require members of the trading crowd as defined in CBOE Rule 8.50 to log onto RAES if OEX RAES participation appears to be inadequate. If inadequate, RAES participation continues, then the chairperson of the OFPC, in consultation with a senior Exchange executive officer, may request the participation of all market makers whether or not they are members of the OEX crowd. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, the Commission believes that the proposal to allow a member to apply to the OFPC for prospective relief from the requirement to log onto RAES on the business day prior to expiration is designed to provide flexibility and to accommodate the needs of individual members while continuing to ensure adequate RAES participation. The Commission notes that the proposal allows the OFPC to limit the grant of relief by imposing time periods during which the applicant will not be eligible to participate in RAES. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission believes that the proposal is also consistent with section 6(b)(5) under the Act in that it is designed to facilitate transactions in securities. The CBOE believes that the current $500.00 fee for failures to comply with the OEX RAES log-on and log-off requirements is excessive in light of the log-on and log-off requirements established under the RAES Approval Order. Based upon this determination, the Commission believes that it is reasonable for the Exchange to replace the current $500.00 fee with a graduated fee schedule and allow the Exchange to impose higher fees for repeated failures, which should encourage compliance with the log-on and log-off requirements and may increase the Exchange's ability to deter repeat offenders. The CBOE has distributed an Exchange Bulletin describing the new fee schedule and the application of the fees to April 30, 1993, the effective date for implementation of the original $500.00 fee. The Commission believes that this notification, and the fact that the graduated fees will be lower than the fees that the CBOE can impose currently under the original $500.00 fee, help to ensure that the fees for failures to comply with the log-on and log-off requirements are imposed fairly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, the Commission believes that the right to appeal the fees imposed under CBOE Rule 24.17 pursuant to Chapter 19 of the CBOE's rules should help to safeguard the procedural rights of OEX RAES participants. In summary, under these limited and unusual circumstances, the Commission believes that the CBOE may implement these lower fees as of April 30, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;94&hyph;12), is hereby approved. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1982). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

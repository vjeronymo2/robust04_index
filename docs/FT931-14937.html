			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Letter: PM must make MI5 accountable Sir, You reported ('MPs press for scrutiny of security services', January 14) that the prime minister is undecided as to whether to include parliamentary accountability of MI5 in his legislative plans. As he claims to believe in open government, John Major should, for once, overrule his home secretary and act decisively. Kenneth Clarke told the home affairs select committee during our investigation: 'I will account (for MI5) and I will not answer any of the tantalising questions.' Such a cynical dismissal of an all-party committee attempting to do its job is breathtaking. Taxpayers who fund MI5 have a right to know how their money is spent. Allegations of MI5 involvement in the arms-for-Iraq, Matrix Churchill and now the 'Camillagate' affairs do nothing to boost public confidence in the security services. Clearly the committee would not wish to risk endangering life by interfering in operational matters, but it is high time the prime minister acted to ensure that the policies, administration and spending of MI5 are fully accountable to parliament. Barbara Roche, member of home affairs committee House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Oleh Dorozhovets: "Kozyrev Is Poking His Nose </F> Into Various Places"]    [Text] Russia's powerful foreign-policy surge in 1994  has left the Americans at sixes and sevens. America simply does  not know what damage it would be easier to reconcile itself  with: either to rid itself of such an essentially pacified  Russia or to abandon certain of its own strategic spheres of  influence.    The United States is constantly following the policy of  share, share, and share. I am amazed at its patience, but I  understand it very well indeed. As a narcotic, as a ruinous  passion, Russia captivated American statesmen. It has become the  most expensive wild animal ever tamed, and--therefore--to  deprive it of breakfast or--Heaven forbid--to beat it would be  equivalent almost to a courtship. But this is only the emotional  side of the matter. The pragmatic analysts in the White House  understand other things too: A dextrous and capable Russia  constitutes the backbone of United States foreign policy, and if  the backbone is broken, the entire organism would be paralyzed.    However, this is also understood by the pragmatic analysts  in  the Kremlin. And, therefore, taking advantage of its own seeming  value, Russia is endeavoring to gradually return into its own  hands the world which it lost. Russia knows how to frighten the  Clinton administration. The latter can be frightened by the  dictatorial policy of the Zhirinovskiy people. Moscow has used  this fright in order to obtain the right to keep troops in  Moldova and the Baltic states, despite the attitude toward this  on the part of the governments in those places. It has likewise  been allowed to conduct "peacekeeping" operations on the  territory of the CIS, as well as to protect and defend the  Russian-speaking population abroad.    The Clinton administration can also be frightened by a  change  of allies. A possible rapprochement between Russia and Great  Britain, for example, and the distancing of the latter from the  United States was very clearly demonstrated by Yeltsin in  February. For three whole days he did not answer Clinton's  telephone calls, citing illness as an excuse, and after this he  spent two days with John Major, who was visiting Moscow. All  this occurred against the background of the exacerbation of the  British-American "special" relationship following a sharp  anti-Clinton campaign in the English media and after Washington  granted an entrance visa to Gerry Adams, the leader of the  anti-government, Northern Ireland Sinn Fein Party.    A third fright is that of a renewal of global confrontation  and a slide toward World War III. Nothing global can happen  without Russia. This thesis of the Russian Federation's minister  of foreign affairs, Kozyrev, has already been espoused in two  unexpected initiatives by Moscow--the introduction of Russian  troops in Sarajevo and Russia's attempt to allocate to itself  the role of peacemaker in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.    But in the latter case Russia seems to have gotten itself  into a sticky wicket. The United States could reconcile itself  with Russia's action in the Balkans, but not in the Middle East.  The Russia idea of holding a second round of the  Palestinian-Israeli conference in Madrid was rejected both in  Washington and in Tel Aviv, even though it was passionately  supported by Yasir Arafat. Let's recall that the first round,  which was co-chaired by the United States and the USSR, ended  without any positive results in 1991. The apotheosis of the  Russian turn to the East had to be Andrey Kozyrev's secret visit  to Tunisia and Israel. Its secrecy could not be maintained, nor  could his statement concerning Russia's desire to send its own  military observers to this region. It was not without reason  that Israel warned about the activities of Russian intelligence  in Syria and other Arab states.    Another two directions in which Russia has been conducting a  diplomatic offensive since the beginning of this year are Inner  and Central Asia and Inner and Central Europe. Its pushing  through into the former is attested to by the visit of Andrey  Kozyrev's deputy, Anatoliy Adamishin, to Tehran, during the  course of which a discussion took place concerning the  possibility of Iran exerting an influence on fundamentalist  terrorist groups which are blocking the road to peace in  Palestine. Also discussed here was a common policy with regard  to the Asian republics of the former USSR. Additional testimony  was the appeal by the chairman of Tajikistan's Supreme Council,  Rakhmanov, to the UN that the Russian troops in his state should  be granted the status of "sky-blue helmets."    As to the Central European sphere, Russia likewise achieved  an incontestible success--something which is called the  "Partnership for Peace." Together with political methods, use  was also made here of an age-old Russian insuperable  weapon--energy resources. The drastic March reduction in the  norms of gas deliveries to almost all the European ex-Soviet  republics. The January attempt to cut off access to oil in the  Czech Republic and Poland. The plans for building a  Yamburg-Belarus-Poland-Western Europe Gas Pipeline.  Participation by Russian shareholders in Estonian, Belarusian,  Ukrainian, and Hungarian energy-transport and petrochemical  enterprises. The energy war may become a geopolitical occupation.    All these movements and shifts in Moscow's renovated foreign  policy have recently encountered a broader and more favorable  response in Britain. This is obviously connected with the  following two factors. On the one hand, London has always  expected from Washington restraints placed on Germany and a less  reflex-type attitude toward Japan. But Clinton--on the  contrary--has adopted for himself the goal of restricting Tokyo,  while unleashing Bonn. On the other hand, at the end of February  Azerbaijan's President Aliyev signed an agreement in London  providing for the Apsheron Oilfield to be developed by a certain  consortium of eight British and American companies headed up by  British Petroleum. At almost the same time the Russian  Federation government prohibited the export of oil by the  principal competitor of these companies--the Russian firm known  as Lukoil. This is sharply different from last year's Russian  stance, as a result of which a contract between Azerbaijan and  Great Britain was almost broken off.    In addition to everything else, Russia's efforts cast doubts  upon Clinton's promise to Kravchuk (made during the latter's  American tour) to the effect that the United States would become  the guarantor of Ukraine's security and integrity. But, of  course, the White House does have the power to play a certain  role here. It is certainly true that Ukraine is viewed in Russia  as a kind of traditional patrimony--a role similar to that  played by Israel to the United States. Russia's meddling in the  Middle East could engender a responding effort at an  intervention by America in the post-Soviet space. Russia's  "rollback" from the Arab region could also evoke a corresponding  American response in Ukraine or in the Baltic region. It is  entirely possible that such a "reciprocal clarification" could  be Russia's actual purpose in making its unrealistic and  precipitous foreign-policy initiatives. This is called a  tactical preventive strike. But this is not an offensive but  instead a defensive tactic. Its principal goal is not to snatch  something belonging to somebody else, but rather to safeguard  something of one's own. Unfortunately, Moscow regards Ukraine as  "its own," just as it does--in the final analysis--all of  Eastern Europe and Central Asia.</p>

South-east England took the brunt of the closures, accounting for about 52 per cent of all reported company failures. The least affected regions were south Wales and Scotland. The sector worst affected by corporate failures was manufacturing, followed by construction, financial services and retailing.

He added: 'Unless the government risks its commitment to reduce inflation and introduces a dramatic reduction in interest rates in order to bring about an increase in consumer confidence, I cannot see recovery happening in the near future.' Mr Hayward warned that exporters would continue to struggle throughout next year, in spite of the apparent lifeline that the pound's departure from the European ex-change rate mechanism had offered.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "News at Ten" program] </F>   [Text] Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani categorically  denied reports that Jordan is providing Yemen with weapons and  spare parts. Dr. al-'Anani was reacting to a statement in Cairo  by the prime minister of South Yemen's secessionist government,  Haydar Abu- Bakr al-'Attas, accusing Jordan and Iraq of  providing the north with military spare parts. The information  minister said Jordan views the current fighting in Yemen as an  internal affair and that the accusations were baseless.    [Begin recording] [Al-'Anani] Well, first of all, as far as  Iraq is concerned, Iraq is being closely monitored especially in  the field of arms. So, as far as that score is concerned, I  think it's not correct, and I am sure it's not correct.    As far as Jordan is concerned, the only transportation we  had  to Yemen was when the internal war took place. Jordan was among  the very few countries, and eventually the only country, which  dared send planes, first of all civilian planes, to rescue  people from the war zone and bring them back -- Jordanian  families and children, and then Arab nationals, and then even  peoples from third countries. We did that on our own risk. The  planes which went there were civilian planes. We had to pay at  a certain time an insurance policy, noncommercial insurance  policy, amounting to half a million dollars per trip, which is  an exorbitant amount to pay. Then we replaced that by empty  planes that brought people back, military planes that brought,  which came back full of people and luggage. And those were  witnessed by many people, they were under cameras and monitored  and so on.    I really don't see where such a claim came. Maybe, it could  be as a result of Jordan's position as far as believing that  legitimacy and legality should prevail in Yemen because Yemen  right now is a sovereign country that has developed its own  institutions through a constitutional process, elections, and so  on and so forth. It is true that the institutional structure  was not yet completed, but we had a state that was acknowledged  by the international community. Therefore, I don't think that we  should mix positions of Jordan, which stem from its strong  adherence to international law and to internal integrity of each  sovereign state in the world, with the fact that Jordan, which  was invited by both warring factions in Yemen to reconciliate  between them. [sentence as heard] They came to Jordan, they  asked Jordan for that role, which we did with the help of other  Arab countries, now to be accused that it is really fuelling the  war that is going on when we abhor bloodshed, and we don't like  it.    [Correspondent Murid Hammad] Some say that this is the price  that Jordan will again have to pay for standing up in favor of  Arab unity and national reconciliation. Do you agree with that?    [Al-'Anani] I agree that Jordan has paid a heavy price for  such positions and maybe Yemen will prove to be another example.  [end recording]</p>

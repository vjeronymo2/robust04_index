			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Bull settles arson case France's Bull group has settled the arson case brought by its insurers in an Illinois court this week, and has received a 'substantial' but undisclosed payment from the insurance companies. New Jersey-based Allendale Mutual Insurance Company and its London-based affiliate, Factory Mutual International agreed to withdraw their claim that Bull had deliberately burned a Zenith Data Systems warehouse at Seclin, France, in 1991, resulting in the loss of large computer inventories. In return, Bull has withdrawn its claim that Allendale and FMI acted in bad faith to avoid paying Bull's insurance claim. The two sides are still in dispute over the amount of insurance coverage Bull had at the time of the fire. That dispute will be decided in Illinois in early January. The settlement of the arson charges ends nearly three years of wrangling, and came two days before the presiding judge would have ended arguments in the case.</p>

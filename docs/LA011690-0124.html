			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CUOMO CALLS FOR INCREASED TAXES AS HE UNVEILS BUDGET  </P> <P> Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, unveiling a $51.3-billion state budget, today called for  about $700 million in higher taxes and fees and proposed that New Yorkers forgo  a promised income tax cut in 1990-91.  </P> <P> Cuomo, a second-term Democrat considered a potential 1992 presidential  contender, said New York needs the extra money to deal with budget deficits and  to combat drug abuse and AIDS.  </P> <P> New York's tax revenue has been hurt by earlier tax cuts and an economic  slowdown in the Northeast, he said.  </P> <P> Under his spending plan, the overall budget would grow 9.3%. Included in his  proposal for additional revenue was a call for an increase in the cigarette tax  of 5 cents a pack to 38 cents.  </P></p>

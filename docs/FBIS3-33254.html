			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National" newscast] </F>   [Text] A frustrated Valledupar Mayor Rodolfo Campos Soto  told the National Newscast of how events unfolded at a guerrilla  check point only 20 minutes away from his city.    [Begin recording] [Campos] We were returning from  (?Mayapola)  when, somewhere between Mayangola and Aguas Blancas, we  discovered the guerrillas had set up a check point obstructing  traffic. The guerrillas stopped every vehicle and encouraged  support for a group called Caribbean Bloc composed of several  FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] fronts. They  distributed a communique protesting the presence of U.S. troops  in the country; they preached to the people who were there; and,  after an hour and a half, allowed traffic to begin circulating  again.    [Unidentified reporter] Were they aware of your presence,  Mr.  Mayor?    [Campos] No. My presence went totally unnoticed, which was  also the case with the president of the Municipal Assembly, the  president of the Municipal Council, Chamber of Representatives  candidate Mauro Tapia, several councilmen, and virtually the  entire municipal administration. The guerrillas were there  simply to promote their new Caribbean Bloc. [end recording]</p>

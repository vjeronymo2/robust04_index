			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TOBACCO AD BAN IN CANADA KINDLES FIRE UNDER CONGRESS  </P> <P> Canada's tough new anti-smoking laws banning print advertising and requiring  disclosure of cigarette ingredients have encouraged advocacy groups in the  United States to demand similar legislation.  </P> <P> "A big part of it is the Canadian bill that shows such legislation can work and  is not just pie in the sky," said Phil Wilbur, director of Advocacy Institute,  a health research center in Washington.  </P> <P> About 100 anti-smoking bills are pending before Congress, including one drafted  by Rep. Mike Synar (D-Okla.) to restrict print advertising and another by Sen.  Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) to eliminate the tax deductibility of tobacco  advertising.  </P> <P> Rep. Tom Lukin (D-Ohio) has asked the Justice Department to look into whether  product placement in movies that might appear on television violates the  current advertising ban.  </P> <P> "The mood in the United States has changed. The swing is against the special  interests represented by the tobacco companies," Wilbur said in a telephone  interview.  </P> <P> He said many of the bills were drafted after Canada led the way. Canada's  smoking ban on airline flights of less than 2 hours' duration in 1987 preceded  similar legislation in the United States.  </P> <P> In 1987, the Conservative government also considered a complete ban on smoking  but opted instead for the restrictive Tobacco Products Control Act that banned  newspaper and magazine advertising and required cigarette companies to disclose  to the Health Department the ingredients in their cigarettes.  </P> <P> A ban on billboard advertising takes effect next January and tobacco companies  have also been ordered to halt sponsorships of sports and cultural events.  </P> <P> Garfield Mahood, executive director of the Non-Smokers Rights Assn. in Toronto  credited with leading the anti-smoking campaign, said the United States will be  under pressure to pass its own Tobacco Products Control Act.  </P> <P> "Americans have a great appreciation of the value of disclosure and this bill  is an example," Mahood said.  </P> <P> "American legislators will be hard pressed to tell Americans why, when the  industry (in Canada) is disclosing the toxic constituents of second-hand smoke,  that information should be privileged in the United States."  </P> <P> The Canadian law has infuriated tobacco companies, which are going to ingenious  lengths to avoid the disclosure clause.  </P> <P> R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. of Winston-Salem, N.C. said in January that it was  changing the recipe of its four brands sold in Canada -- Winston, Camel, Salem  and More -- to get around the disclosure regulation.  </P> <P> "The company doesn't have to give the recipe to any other government. To  protect the confidentiality (of ingredients) it made a switch on the Canadian  product," said Jeffrey Labow of RJR Macdonald Inc., the Canadian subsidiary of  R.J. Reynolds.  </P> <P> Labow said the new brands went on sale 3 weeks ago and it is still too early to  estimate the impact on sales. However, the company said its research indicated  that people who tried them "don't see any difference whatsoever."  </P> <P> U.S. cigarette makers want to protect their tiny niche in Canada, where imports  have a 1% market share. The market is expected to improve under the U.S.-Canada  free trade agreement, which will reduce or eliminate tariffs on imported  American cigarettes.  </P> <P> Statistics Canada, the government's reporting agency, estimated that there were  5.6 million smokers in the country in 1986. While the number of male smokers  has declined, a growing number of women seem to be taking up the habit, it  said.  </P> <P> Canada's three tobacco companies, RJR Macdonald, Imperial Tobacco Ltd. and  Rothmans Benson &amp; Hedges Inc., have launched separate court challenges of  the Tobacco Products Control Act.  </P> <P> RJR Macdonald, in documents filed in the Quebec Superior Court, charges that  the legislation violates freedom of speech guarantees in the Charter of Rights  and Freedoms.  </P> <P> The company also says the law puts Canadian cigarette companies at a  disadvantage because the advertising ban does not apply to foreign magazines.  About 60% of cigarette advertising read by Canadians appears in U.S.  publications.  </P> <P> In the United States, the American Bar Assn., along with the newspaper and  magazine publishing industries, vigorously opposed similar legislation  suggested 2 years ago.  </P></p>

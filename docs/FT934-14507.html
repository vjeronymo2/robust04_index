			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Polly Peck case may move courts THE High Court action brought by the administrators of Polly Peck to recover Pounds 75m of missing funds from Citibank could be halted and transferred to courts in Switzerland after a dispute over jurisdiction. Touche Ross, the PPI administrators, claim that Citibank's Swiss subsidiary is liable for Pounds 75m of the money allegedly transferred by Mr Asil Nadir, former Polly Peck chairman, from Citibank London to its Zurich operation and then used for his personal purposes. Mr Justice Vinelott, the trial judge, has decided to adjourn the case until the Swiss authorities decide if it is within their jurisdiction.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Emergency Meeting Protesting Suppression of Chongnyon and </F> Persecution of Koreans in Japan Held in Tokyo" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Tokyo, June 25 [dateline as received] (KNS-KCNA) --  An emergency meeting protesting the suppression of the General  Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) by the  Japanese police and its persecution of Koreans in Japan was held  in Tokyo on June 21.    Attending it were Toshio Nejima, secretary general of the  National Liaison Council of Trade Unions, Hiroshi Wakabayashi,  secretary general of the Japan Committee for Supporting the  Independent and Peaceful Reunification of Korea, and other  public figures and citizens, more than 200 in all.    Japanese lawyer Shigeru Tokoi at the meeting roundly exposed  the illegality and injustice of the search of the Osaka and  Kyoto prefectural organisations of Chongnyon by the Japanese  police and denounced it as a political crackdown designed to  collect information for the destruction of Chongnyon and enact  "an emergency law".    An appeal was adopted at the meeting.    The appeal said that the Japanese Government must  immediately  express apology and repentance to Chongnyon and Koreans in  Japan. "The governmnt's policy must not be sanctions against the  DPRK but the establishment of Japan-DPRK diplomatic relations  and postwar compensation," it said, strongly demanding an early  apology by the Japanese Government.</p>

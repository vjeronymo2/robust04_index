			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / BR manager slams sell-off proposals: Separation of track and operations is 'folly' A SENIOR British Rail manager hoping to lead a buy-out of one of BR's busiest InterCity routes has publicly denounced the government's privatisation plans as unworkable. Mr Brian Scott, director of InterCity's Great Western division, describes the proposed separation of track and operations as 'folly' and warns that a 'spiral of decline' caused by lack of investment will prevent anyone making profits from Great Western. The attack is significant because it comes from the head of one of the seven BR routes last week designated by the government as the first candidates for privatisation in 1994. Mr Scott plans to lead a management bid for the franchise to operate Great Western's main line services from London Paddington to much of south-west England and Wales. In letter to Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, Mr Scott says he is not against privatisation but believes impediments to running a successful private railway must be removed. His strongest criticisms are aimed at the government's plan to transfer control of the tracks from train operators to a new track authority. 'As an experienced, professional railway business manager I would not put my money into a train operating company - running a high-speed intensive service such as Great Western - without having day-to-day command and control of operations including signalling and track and track maintenance,' he said. 'Whoever runs the business would be committing an act of folly to buy into something with so little control of performance, and therefore, profit.' Mr Scott also attacked the climate for investment, saying the private sector will have no incentive to invest in assets with a lifespan of up to 30 years if franchises last only five to 10 years. Investment in Great Western, he says, needs to rise from Pounds 20m to Pounds 60m a year just to replace existing assets: 'If this increase in investment is not under way within three years, a spiral of decline will prevent anyone making profits on Great Western.' British Rail yesterday tacitly supported Mr Scott's criticisms by distributing copies of his letter to the media and acknowledging that it had been seen by Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman, and Mr Chris Green, InterCity director. However, it said that Mr Scott was not writing on behalf of BR. The attack comes as MPs begin their consideration of the Railways Bill today. Observer, Page 17</p>

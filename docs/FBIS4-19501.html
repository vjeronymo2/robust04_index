			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by Michel </F> Colomes; place and date not given: "France Put to the Test"]    [Text]  <H5>  Bosnia </H5>   [Colomes] If there really is a Serbian offensive against  Gorazde, why do we just have symbolic, selective, and limited  air strikes?    [Juppe] The UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] response has  been  in proportion to the threat. I should note in passing that the  UN procedures have been improved, as France requested, since the  time between the request for intervention and the final decision  has been reduced to less than half an hour, rather than over  four hours as was the case in Bihac.    [Colomes] What action would we take if the Serbs do not  yield  on the ground and continued their offensive? Are you certain  that these air strikes will be effective?    [Juppe] That is an old dispute. We have been told  alternatively that these strikes are completely ineffective and  that they are a miracle cure. I do not believe them to be  either. They are necessary to clearly illustrate the resolve of  the international community, but they are not a durable  solution. It is a way of reacting. The only stable solution is  a political and diplomatic one. What worries me, in the current  situation, is the risk of escalation and the delays caused to  negotiations.    [Colomes] Why was no ultimatum issued, as in Sarajevo?    [Juppe] Because the conditions were already in place for  NATO  intervention. The decision was undoubtedly made because of the  urgency of the situation. Now we must, I repeat, return to  diplomacy. The method of bilateral contacts used for the last  month and a half, first by the Americans and then by the  Russians, has proved useful. It has made it possible to arrive  at an agreement between Croats and Muslims, and to establish a  cease fire between them that has been respected. However, we  are starting to see the limits of this method. Today it is  clear: You cannot make peace between two sides when three sides  are involved in the conflict. What France is asking for now is  that we get everyone, including the Serbs, around the  negotiating table: the three protagonists plus the major  powers, without whom there will be no solution.    [Colomes] So you want to reconcile the American diplomatic  process and the European one?    [Juppe] Absolutely. The only overall proposal that currently  exists is the European action plan.    [Colomes] Are the two plans -- the American plan and the  European plan -- compatible?    [Juppe] That is a question I have asked Warren Christopher a  number of times, and I have been assured that they are  compatible. If you read the two texts you can see for yourself:  The Muslim-Croat agreement does not contradict the European  plan. We must therefore view the various initiatives in an  overall perspective. Specifically, France wants to include the  Americans and the Russians in the London conference, in addition  to the European Union and the United Nations. The recent  Owen-Stoltenberg-Redman-Churkin meeting was a first step in this  direction. I think that this is the only way to say to the  three parties on the ground: This is the joint position of the  major powers, and here is what we are asking, starting with a  cease fire between Serbs and Muslims to avoid an escalation of  the Gorazde conflict.    [Colomes] The Muslims refuse a cease fire because they think  they are in a difficult military position, and would rather  continue fighting....    [Juppe] We cannot accept that. If we did, we would get  caught up in a downward spiral where the United Nations and the  Atlantic Alliance would be supporting the Sarajevo government's  attempts to regain lost ground. President Clinton himself  recently said much the same thing.    We prefer discussion to confrontation. We know that, in  Gorazde, the first attack came from the Muslim side, and the  Serbs then responded wholly disproportionately, as is their  custom. We cannot be held hostage to that game. We must say so  now, and all four of us (Europeans, Americans, Russians, and the  United Nations) must say it with one voice.    [Colomes] To bring the Serbs back around the negotiating  table, should we not try to alter the terms of the embargo?    [Juppe] That is the second argument in favor of a return to  the European action plan, since this plan links the process of  finding a political solution with, first, the suspension and,  second, the lifting of sanctions against Serbia. We need a big  stick -- the ultimatum put to Serbia was an example of this --  but we also need a carrot.    [Colomes] On the subject of air strikes in Gorazde, why did  you not inform the Russians?    [Juppe] The Russians voted for resolution 836 on safe areas.  They have contingents on the ground under UNPROFOR command, and  it was in this context that the decision was made. There does  not seem to me to be anything there that could offend them. On  the other hand, I do think we should involve the Russians more  in the peace process. That is why France proposes placing  everyone -- belligerents and major powers -- around the one  table.  <H5>  China </H5>   [Colomes] You have just accompanied the prime minister on a  delicate trip to China, in the course of which the Chinese  authorities seemed to take pleasure in strewing your path with  obstacles -- increasing the number of arrests, taking people  into custody, detentions, and placing dissidents in guarded  accommodation. Since the American secretary of state had  already fallen pray to a similar series of events, could you not  have foreseen this risk and taken preventive measures?    [Juppe] The only way to prevent it would have been by not  going. That would have meant remaining in the same position as  before, with China and France not talking to each other. When I  became foreign minister, one year ago, relations had virtually  been broken off. Let me just give you one example: Our  ambassador at the time, one of our best diplomats and a fluent  Chinese-speaker, no longer had any contact with the Chinese  ministries. We had reached an advanced state of sulking. Can  you imagine France having no dialogue with a power such as  China? Maybe some people were resigned to that fact, but I was  not. As a result, we did everything we could -- and it was a  long process -- to restore dialogue. In China, I felt that the  authorities wanted to reestablish contacts and I did not at all  have the feeling that they were making things more difficult.  As a result, the trip was successful. Quite possibly, it was  not to the liking of all the Chinese factions or the people  observing China's relations with the rest of the world. It is  quite possible, too, that there were struggles for influence  which led to the measures you described. However, I would like  to add two things.    First, we did not hide what we felt. We told the Chinese  very clearly what we thought of the human rights situation in  their country. We did not do it publicly at the microphone, but  our message did get across.    Second, with regard to the arrests, it is hard to see  clearly  what is was all about. When we arrived in Shanghai, press  agency dispatches spoke of "arrests." We immediately asked the  Chinese authorities for explanations. I myself summoned the  Chinese ambassador to France and told him: "I want an answer  within a few hours." The answer duly came, in the form of a  clear commitment from the Chinese minister accompanying Mr.  Balladur: no dissidents had been imprisoned since our arrival.    [Colomes] They were playing word games. They had not  imprisoned them, they had simply detained them in police  stations and released them the day after you left....    [Juppe] XINHUA itself confirmed, on the day we left, that no  0one had been arrested and that everyone taken in for  questioning had been released.    I think it is quite interesting that so much attention is  being paid to human rights in China. When we go to the Arab  countries which apply the Shariah, does anyone ask questions  about women's rights? When we go to Vietnam, is anyone quite as  interested in human rights there? I could list all the  countries in the world where the human rights situation is not  what it should be. France speaks out when this is the case, and  we told China. Everything else is an exaggeration or  manipulation.    [Colomes] Was it not a kind of confession of weakness on our  part to go to Beijing after having done a kind of about-turn by  abandoning Taiwan? Did we not have a stronger position in the  past, when we balanced relations between China and Taiwan?    [Juppe] Who says we have abandoned Taiwan? That is not true.  Our cooperation, especially in the civil domain, remains  promising. However, we have to reestablish political dialogue  with Beijing, especially where North Korea, Cambodia, Vietnam,  and regional security issues are concerned. These are very  important issues. We cannot cut ourselves off from a country  like China because of them. Let me explain about Taiwan: We  simply said that we would observe the required restraint in arms  deliveries and that we would stop supplying Taiwan with weapons  that could endanger China. It is the least we can do!  <H5>  Rwanda </H5>   [Colomes] Now that we have completed, and succeeded,  evacuating French nationals from Rwanda, are we going to let the  inhabitants of that country continue killing each other?    [Juppe] Is France the policeman for the whole universe? Does  France have the means and the responsibility for preventing  people from killing each other all over the planet?    [Colomes] Perhaps not France alone, but the United Nations?    [Juppe] The United Nations has tried, and so has France. For  years, we have been working for the reconciliation of the  various factions. We supported the Arusha agreement and had a  military contingent in the country for months. We only pulled  our troops out last year when the UN forces arrived. We thought  that the peace process was working. Then there was the attack  on the aircraft carrying the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi  which led to the current conflagration. Clearly, our duty was  to evacuate French nationals, and we did that, coolly and  quickly. Now we have to rebuild the conditions for dialogue and  give the United Nations back its role. We will work toward this.  <H5>  Algeria </H5>   [Colomes] In Algeria, which is sinking into civil war, a new  government team has taken office....    [Juppe] Yes, but it is still too early to talk about it  because it is difficult to interpret the significance of General  Zeroual's latest cabinet reshuffle. What line will the new  government take? We will see when we know the composition of  this government, especially for two important posts: the  interior (will the hard line be maintained?) and finance (will  discussions continue with the International Monetary Fund?).    [Colomes] What will we do if the situation in Algeria gets  worse? Are we ready to welcome anyone who wants to enter France?    [Juppe] Of course, we will welcome French nationals. We have  already repatriated some two-thirds of our nationals in Algeria.  Then there are those people with dual nationality who hold a  French passport.    Beyond that, we have to examine the question clearly: Can  and must French society today open its doors to tens of  thousands -- and the figure could run into hundreds of thousands  -- of Algerians who potentially have dual nationality but who do  not currently hold a French passport, or even to refugees?  Generosity and fine sentiments are one thing, but the reality  of the social balance in France also counts for a lot. I do not  think that France could today open its doors to thousands of  immigrants from North Africa. There are other countries we could  call on to show their solidarity, such as Algeria's neighbors or  other Mediterranean countries. France cannot do everything on  its own.    [Colomes] Faced with this crisis, does France feel that it  has been abandoned somewhat by its traditional allies?    [Juppe] France feels it is alone. It is true, it feels it is  in the front line. We are trying to do two things: First,  convince certain of our partners that, even if political  dialogue is necessary, the arrival of an extremist, anti-French,  anti-European, anti-Western regime in Algeria would threaten the  balance of the whole region. There would inevitably be a  contagious effect on the other countries of the Maghreb and  maybe beyond.    Second, we are trying to encourage the Algerian people to  restructure their economy and we are looking to mobilize  international aid to help them do this. As soon as the dinar  has been devalued and the IMF agreement signed, Algeria's debt  must be rescheduled and the European countries, and others, too,  if possible -- I have called on Japan, Algeria's second largest  creditor -- must do everything they can to lessen Algeria's debt  burden, which is completely stifling the economy.  <H5>  Russia </H5>   [Colomes] Can you see a hardening in Russian foreign policy  since the election of the new Duma?    [Juppe] Yes, but without doubt these hesitations or  contradictions are related to the complexity of the Russian  political landscape. Just think about what happened in the  former Yugoslavia: One day people were shooting their mouths  off, the next day they were calming things down. Thus, there is  certainly the need for President Yeltsin and his government to  take account of the rise in nationalist feeling, including in  the Duma, but, at the same time, they want to continue their  cooperation and partnership with the West.    [Colomes] Should we alter our attitude to cater for their  new  position?    [Juppe] I am one of those people who think that we should  help Russia, not isolate it. We have to tell them a few home  truths, however. First, about human rights and democracy.  People are talking about them in China, so let us also talk  about them in Russia. The state of law has made progess with  the December legislative elections and referendum, but there is  still more to be done. Second, we must tell them: "We will  help you, but on certain conditions." We are not prepared to  throw our money down the drain, and aid can only be effective if  economic reforms are implemented in Russia. Third, we are not  ready to give Russia the right to veto what is happening in  Central and East Europe. For what the Russians call the "near  abroad," we will readily recognize a certain responsibility that  falls to Russia, but on condition that this responsibility is  met within the framework of the United Nations or the CSCE. We  will not be writing them any blank checks. I think that these  three truths should be expressed in a context of political  openness and free cooperation. That is what I intend to say  when I go to Russia in May.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Unfortunately, a large number of engineers have  gravitated to Tehran, and it is for this reason that we are  faced with a shortage of engineers in the provinces. With the  creation of the Civil Engineering Regulatory Organization, the  distribution of [the engineering] workforce throughout the  country will become equitable.    An ABRAR correspondent reports that, yesterday, Engineer  Seyyed Reza Hashemi, deputy minister of Urban Development and  Architecture Affairs of the Ministry of Housing, in an interview  with journalists, said that the second elections of the Civil  Engineering Regulatory Organization will be held simultaneously  in 25 provinces.    He added: Throughout the country there are 25,000 engineers  in different fields, at least 50 percent of whom are in Tehran  and the rest of them are in rural areas. Hashemi also said that  with the completion of these elections, which will be held  simultaneously during the month of Esfand [20 February-20  March], an organization and a management council to handle  engineering affairs will be established in each province.    He added: The Ministry of Housing and Urban Development  enacted national construction regulations five years ago, and  these regulations have been arranged in 20 chapters, seven of  which have been approved by the cabinet council. Of course, the  government is not able to be both legislator and enforcer. For  this reason, from now on, these provincial organizations will  inspect and investigate violations of construction regulations.    In response to ABRAR's question of whether the Civil  Engineering Regulatory Organization is considered a branch of  the Ministry of Housing or if it will be independent, Eng.  Hashemi said that the government and the Ministry of Housing  must support such organizations and supervise their work, but he  said that on the whole this organization will act independently.    Our correspondent asked: If it is considered independent,  then why does the Ministry of Housing interfere directly in its  elections?    The deputy minister of housing answered: We [the Ministry of  Housing] will hold the first elections, but future elections  will be their own responsibility.    During this same interview, Musa Firuzi, the public  relations  director of the Ministry of Housing, said: the Ministry of  Housing, with an allocation of 150 billion rials, has undertaken  48 university projects that will cover an infrastructure of  400,000 square meters, with a capacity of 50,000 students--10  projects of which will be ready for use during the 10 Days of  Dawn.    He added: During the same time, 92 development projects,  which will include rehabilitation and physiotherapy centers, and  security stations, 83 housing units and 175 classrooms, will be  ready for use.    In conclusion, Firuzi said: 50,000 lots are also being  prepared, which after completion will be delivered to those who  had applied for them.</p>

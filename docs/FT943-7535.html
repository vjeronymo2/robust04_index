			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Mexican Elections: Stocks rise but caution sounded Mexican stocks surged by 1.8 per cent to a new six-month high at the end of trading yesterday, after the ruling party's election victory. The peso also appreciated significantly against the dollar. However, analysts said that, because many investors had already bet heavily on this outcome in the weeks before the election, profit-taking was likely over the next few days. This did not occur yesterday because of the ample margin of the ruling party's victory and an absence of civil unrest. 'There is no question that people are buying. . . and that there is a general influx of capital into the market. But profit-taking may obscure the market's fundamental long-term strength,' said Mr Chris Luft, lead trader with Marvin &amp; Palmer, US money manager. Those investors who have been valuing the market higher on the basis of political events are expected to be the most cautious between now and Mr Ernesto Zedillo's inauguration on December 1. The strength of demonstrations called for by leftist leader Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who finished a distant third in the election but is crying foul, and the final judgment of the electoral process by independent observer groups, are two of the many political uncertainties the market will have to weigh. 'There is likely to be as much negative political news as positive in the next months. The dedicated guys are going to be very cautious. . . but that will be offset by those who are not playing politics' and just reacting to the good news, said Mr Robert J Pelosky, director of Latin American research and strategy at Morgan Stanley in New York. Mr Pelosky said the market's leading indicator needed to 'rest and gather strength' around the current level of 2,700 points before surging to the expected 3,000-mark towards the end of the year. The market rally is likely to be upheld by Mexican investors who 'are a little more relieved, as they were not as optimistic (before the elections) as the foreigners,' according to Mr Felix Boni, director of research at the Mexican brokerage Interacciones. Mr Boni cited the low turnout for Mr Cardenas as a factor not yet been completely discounted by the market. Mr Zedillo's presidential victory also increases the likelihood that Mexico will receive an investment-grade rating, although there is 'no rush,' according to one credit-risk analyst. 'Let Zedillo get inaugurated and form a government. Then we ought to be able to go ahead,' he said. An investment-grade rating from the likes of Moody's and Standard &amp; Poors is considered key for the infrastructure drive Mr Zedillo has promised, as it would lower the price of a slew of government bonds expected to be issued in the early days of a new government by the country's development banks and agencies.

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Ashdown renews approach to Labour MR PADDY Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday tried to step up pressure on the Labour party and his own colleagues to work in a broader movement for political reform in Britain. Without 'a re-shaping of British politics,' the Liberal Democrat and Labour parties were in danger of drifting into irrelevance, Mr Ashdown said on BBC television. Labour's leadership remained cool about Liberal Democrat advances, insisting that it was Mr Ashdown who should move towards them and not visa versa. Neither party is talking about formal pacts. A senior Labour party official denied reports that Mr John Smith, Labour leader, might postpone decisions on the party's links with trade unions beyond its autumn conference, a delay that would have provoked much Liberal Democrat criticism. In spite of swelling opposition among trade unionists, Mr Smith is determined to push ahead with plans for ending the trade union's involvement in elections for the party leadership and the selection of parliamentary candidates. Separately Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, was upbeat about modernising the party's structure and policies. He said Labour had led the way on democratic and constitutional reform: 'Of course if Liberal Democrat supporters like it, that's fine,' he said.</p>

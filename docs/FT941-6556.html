			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Bolton Group Bolton Group, property investor, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 21,000 to Pounds 183,000 in the six months ended October 31 1993, on turnover down from Pounds 1.21m to Pounds 720,000. The results reflect the effect of disposals of investment properties and the sale of a subsidiary. Funds from these disposals have been used to reduce borrowings and financing costs. The latter are down from Pounds 629,000 to Pounds 446,000. The deficit on the profit and loss account has been reduced from Pounds 1.23m to Pounds 74,000 and the directors hope to eliminate it in the near future. Earnings per share rose from 0.2p to 1.8p. There is again no dividend.</p>

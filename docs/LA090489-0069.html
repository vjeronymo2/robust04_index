			<p><P> September 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TINY PANDA DIES; HOPES FOR ANOTHER BIRTH AT ZOO FADE  </P> <P> Despite medical care that matched the best efforts to save a premature human  baby, a tiny, sickly panda cub died at the National Zoo early Sunday morning.  </P> <P> The death of the little cub also cast serious doubt on the likelihood that a  giant panda will ever be raised in a U.S. zoo.  </P> <P> Ling-Ling, the one female panda given by Chinese officials to the United States  in 1972, is now 20 years old and has lost all five cubs born at the zoo. Her  pregnancy this year was considered remarkable in itself because no other panda  of her age had been known to give birth.  </P> <P> "If we are very lucky, she may breed at 21 years of age," a disappointed zoo  director Michael Robinson said Sunday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Medical Efforts  </P> <P> Veterinarians who worked for 40 hours to save the little cub said he died of an  infection contracted from his mother.  </P> <P> The 3.1-ounce cub, smaller than a stick of butter, was put in an oxygen-filled  incubator, administered antibiotics and fed liquids through a tube. The tiny  cub rallied briefly on Saturday, but finally died of the infection before 1  a.m. Sunday.  </P> <P> The chief culprit appears to be a recurring urinary tract infection in the  mother panda, Dr. Mitchell Bush, the zoo's chief veterinarian, said Sunday.  </P> <P> Two years ago, a newborn cub nearly twice as large as this year's offspring  lived four days but died of an infection. Since then, zoo officials have sought  to disinfect the panda house at the zoo and inject the female with periodic  doses of antibiotics. But the mother's infection returned in recent weeks.  </P> <P> Shortly after the little cub emerged squealing on Friday, zoo officials  anesthetized the mother and removed the cub, hoping to build its immune system  to ward off infection. Instead, they discovered the new cub was already badly  infected, and it did not have strength to survive.  </P> <P> "I still think it's possible we can raise a cub" in captivity, Bush said. "This  one was infected and small, even for a premature one. Just give us a normal  size cub and no infection," he said.  </P> <P> A twin to this cub was spontaneously aborted two weeks ago.  </P> <P> Ling-Ling and her mate, Hsing-Hsing, 19, are the only giant pandas on permanent  display in the United States. In their early years together, the two suffered  from what zoo officials called "inadequate mating skills." Since 1983, however,  the two have mated nearly every year, but all of the cubs have died at or  shortly after birth.  </P> <P> Only about 1,000 giant pandas are believed to be living wild in the mountains  of central China. Pandas have been bred artificially in zoos in Tokyo, Mexico  City and Madrid, but the National Zoo's pair are the only ones trying to breed  naturally, according to zoo officials.  </P></p>

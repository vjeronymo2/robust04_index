			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Amelia Roque] </F>   [Text] Havana, 4 Jan (PL) -- One of the Cuban Book  Institute's [Instituto Cubano del Libro, ICL] main achievements  during 1993 was the marketing of approximately 270 books in the  domestic market and the printing of an additional 100 to be sold  in Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Africa.    In an interview given to PRENSA LATINA, ICL President Pablo  Pacheco has explained that during the current economic crisis,  book publishing has continued despite limited paper and supplies  available to the national printing press industry.    The ICL increased jointly the use of coeditions with the  Universities of Guadalajara, Mexican National Autonomous, Valle,  Cali, Colombia, and with Venezuelan firms such as Pomaire.    The following books resulted from this joint effort: Yellow  Submarine [Submarino Amarillo] (an anthology of Cuban stories),  A Group Advances Quietly [Un Grupo Avanza Silencioso] (a  selection of young Cuban poets), and stories by narrator Onelio  Jorge Cardoso.    During the past year, Cuban publishing houses distributed  the  following books on the island: The American Expression, by Jose  Lezama Lima (Cuban literature); The Cat and the Mouse, by Gunter  Grass (art and literature); The Religious System of the  Afro-Cubans, by Romulo Lachatanere (social sciences), and  scientific-technological publications.    Comparing the amount of books printed in 1993 to previous  years-- 2,500 editions were printed in 1989--the ICL president  said the crisis hindered the printing press, not intellectual  activity.    This is confirmed, he said, by the numbers of international  awards received by writers of the island. For example, Eliseo  Diego received the "Juan Rulfo" Latin American and Caribbean  Award; a poetry book by Jose Perez Olivares received the Spanish  "Rafael Alberti" Award; Daniel Chavarria, an Uruguayan who  resides in Havana, received the Mexican Planeta Novel Award,  among others.    Pacheco also mentioned the New Pines Collection [Coleccion  Pinos Nuevos]--which promotes 100 unpublished Cuban  authors--sponsored by Argentine intellectuals, headed by Aurelio  Narvaja, the Colihue Publishing Firm director, cultural promoter  Monica Sorin, and several authors.    Approximately 600 original texts were received for this  collection, the expert added. Pacheco also revealed that those  books will be presented at the Sixth International Book Fair in  Havana next February.    Pacheco believes last year's most important achievement was  the implementation of a new financing system that will allow the  institute's free convertible currency revenues to be used to  print Cuban material for sales abroad.    Previously, the institute only had the government's support.  The current self-financing program will allow the institute to  have a publishing program that has possibilities for growth once  Cuban books reenter the international market, Pacheco concluded.</p>

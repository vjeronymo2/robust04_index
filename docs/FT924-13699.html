			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / EC and US closer to farm trade deal THE European Community and the US have all but resolved two of the three remaining disputes over subsidised farm trade, according to EC officials. Hopes are high that this could soon clear the way for agreement on the Uruguay Round world trade liberalisation talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, despite intense lobbying by farmers on both sides. According to senior EC officials and leaders of the US Farm Bureau, the influential US farm lobby, Washington has agreed that compensation to European farmers for big price cuts agreed in May's reform of the EC farm regime will be exempt from the Gatt requirement to reduce overall domestic subsidies by 20 per cent. The Uruguay Round 'final act' will be rewritten to reflect this breakthrough, which nevertheless must be endorsed by the other Gatt negotiating participants, which number 108 in all. The two sides are also now examining the legal texts of three formulas for cutting subsidised exports by up to 24 per cent. According to one senior official, this is very close to being agreed. They still differ, however, on the extent to which the EC must cut its oilseeds output to comply with a separate Gatt ruling. The main problem here is that the US is not confident that the EC's farm reform can deliver sufficient cuts. Talks in Brussels between the two sides' top negotiators were suspended late on Monday night after 21 hours, with both sides divulging nothing except that the gap between them had narrowed. It is now clear that a deal could have been clinched then, but for last minute pressure from the US Farm Bureau. Mr Dean Kleckner, president of the Farm Bureau, agreed yesterday that he had been 'kicking his heels' in Brussels on Monday. Meetings are planned between Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external affairs commissioner, and Mrs Carla Hills, US special trade representative, in Ontario at the weekend, and between Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, and Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary, probably next week. Officials from both sides say agreement has to be reached before the US presidential election on November 3 if the round is to be concluded. The betting in Brussels is that President George Bush would like to announce an agreement on the Uruguay Round in the week before election day. The EC is under strong pressure from France to concede nothing to the US which will affect its cereals exports, pressure which will be highlighted by today's 'day of action' by protesting French farmers.

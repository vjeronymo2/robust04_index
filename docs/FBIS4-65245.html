			<p>BFN     [Text] In Italy, Prime Minister Berlusconi has said that  the neofascist ministers in his government should not be  regarded as such, but rather as men of the Center-Right, or even  the Center-Left. This does not seem to be the opinion of the  deputy leader of the neofascist party, which held a meeting  yesterday, and which has not given up its attachment to the  memory of Mussolini. Alain de Chalvron is in Rome:    [de Chalvron] Scarcely had the government been put together  when the neofascists of the MSI [Italian Social Movement]  gathered for a little meeting to prepare for the European  elections. The hardliners were here: the guest of honor was Pino  Rauti, the party's second in command, previously the leader,  removed by Fini. For him, and for all the others there, there  should be no false modesty:    [Begin Rauti recording] We are the defenders of values that  existed before fascism, and during fascism, and they have the  right to exist after fascism. These are the values that we  fought for. The (?youngest people) in the post-fascist period, I  myself in the fascist period, in the last phase of the war, in  the Italian social republic [sentence as heard]. The battle is  one over values and spirituality, rather than over the economic  aspects of life and existence.    The defense of the family, the defense of (?the faith), the  defense of traditional values -- many things. I don't think all  of this was perfect in the fascist regime, but nevertheless it  was a trend (?to be defended).    The doctrine of fascism is not dictatorship. Dictatorship  was a necessity of the other postwar period; it was the  personality of Mussolini; there was the great world crisis after  the economic crisis in the United States, and many things that  made fascism an authoritarian phenomenon. [end recording]    [de Chalvron] With all due respect to Fini, the great  burnisher of the MSI's image, and to Berlusconi who is saying  today that his allies are by no means neofascists, there is  certainly a whole tendency within the National Alliance which  looks back to the past and is proud of it.</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls below 22,000 on arbitrage unwinding A FALL in futures led market professionals to unwind arbitrage positions with the cash market in equities yesterday, and the Nikkei average declined for the first time in four trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average fell through the 22,000 level to close 139.99 down at 21,999.60, after a low of 21,831.16 in the morning session and a high of 22,116.54 in the afternoon. The index fluctuated amid low activity led by dealers, and volume fell to 180m shares from 200m. Declining shares led those advancing by 550 to 380, with 180m shares remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 3.76 to 1,628.86 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 3.29 to 1,247.10. Enthusiasm waned for last Friday's political initiative to rescue the market, which had driven the index up 2.7 per cent during the previous two days. Traders said that buying activity, prompted by hopes of a government support package for the stock market, had been dealer-led and investors had failed to follow the activity. Mr Craig Chudler, strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said that a scenario involving politicians proposing support for the market before the elections was viewed with some caution by investors. Selling pressure in the futures market mounted as investment trusts liquidated holdings in anticipation of meeting redemptions. Traders said that the decline in futures prices prompted arbitrage-related selling. In the afternoon session, the Nikkei briefly regained the 22,000 level following the rebound in the futures market. But as futures lost momentum towards the close, the index also lost ground. Speculative activity pushed up Nippon Television, which gained Y600 to Y20,100. Some dealers and individuals looking for quick profits were seen trading the stock, which is known for its illiquidity. However, profit-taking pushed other high-priced issues lower. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y7,000 to Y706,000 after a three-day advance. Sega Enterprises, the video game maker, fell Y100 to Y13,700 while Nintendo lost Y300 to Y11,400. Electronic companies were bought on bargain-hunting. Hitachi gained Y7 to Y931 and Sony added Y20 to Y4,360. CSK, the computer software company, rose Y140 to Y4,290 thanks to the reduction of the stock's minimum trading unit from 1,000 shares to 100 shares. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 91.76 to 23,622.59 in volume of 84.5m shares. The index fell for the first time in six trading days due to increased profit-taking and stop-loss selling. Roundup MOST of the Pacific Rim celebrated the Chinese new year: Hong Kong, Singapore, Seoul, Taiwan and Kuala Lumpur were closed. AUSTRALIA was weaker, with a ADollars 25m portfolio sale pushing the All Ordinaries index as low as 1,593.0 in morning trade before it recovered to close 11.0 lower at 1,600.3. The economic statement from Prime Minister Mr Paul Keating, due on February 26, and some earnings downgradings were making the market nervous. News Corp declined 36 cents to ADollars 14.40 and BHP shed 14 cents to ADollars 13.48. Coles Myer, the retailer, declined a further 16 cents to ADollars 11.54 following Monday's poor half-year sales figures. Elsewhere, the all-gold index was off 5.9 at 1209.7 while on the Sydney futures market the March Share Price Index contract fell 12.2 to 1613.8. NEW ZEALAND rose in active trading helped by government data which showed a 1.3 per cent increase in third quarter GDP. The NZSE-40 index put on 2.47 to 1,461.54. Fletcher Challenge gained 5 cents to NZDollars 3.47, while Lion Nathan declined 4 cents to NZDollars 3.48. BOMBAY ended mixed in thin trading, weighed down by trading restrictions. The BSE index rose 5.91 to 2,278.72. On Monday the BSE authorities banned forward deals in specified stocks, raised purchase margins on cash stocks and imposed daily trading limits to deter excessive speculation. BANGKOK remained cautious awaiting today's market debut of Bangkok Land. The SET index was up 2.53 at 769.72 in turnover of Bt4bn. MANILA closed mixed with the composite index down 5.34 to 1,261.94 in turnover of 155m pesos, down from 200m pesos. JAKARTA saw active trading in local stocks: the index fell 1.14 to 286.05 in volume of 14m shares (18.6m).</p>

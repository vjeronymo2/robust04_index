			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 10 (KCNA) -- Kang Yong-hun, president  of the South Korean puppet Red Cross, in his "Address on the  World Red Cross Day" on May 9 turned down again the North's  demand for the repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan,  alleging that "they are not prisoners of war to be repatriated",  a radio report from Seoul said.    This is an unreasonable attitude casting a chill on the  public opinion at home and abroad calling for their repatriation.    They were taken prisoners by a bewligerent party during the  Korean war, while serving the People's Army and the guerrilla  unit. So, they should have been sent back to the North when POWs  were exchanged right after the ceasefire.    Kang Yong-hun's remarks are a far-fetched argument and a  wanton violation of international law.    Still more serious is that he brought forward the issue of  the return of the crew of the ship "Tongjin" who were captured  when they infiltrated into the waters of the North for  espionage. The issue has nothing to do with the repatriation of  Kim In-so and Ham Se- hwan.    Their repatriation is an issue on POWs. So, the two issues  are quite different from each other.    The South Korean puppet clique are obliged to immediately  send ohem back to the North both from the view of the  international law and humanitarianism.    The Kim Yong-sam group must immediately send them back to  the  North where their families and relatives are living, as required  by international law and public opinion at home and abroad,  instead of blocking their repatriation by raising unjustifiable  conditions.</p>

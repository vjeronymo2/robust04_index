This emerged  after several hours of talks between ANC President Nelson  Mandela and his IFP counterpart, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, in Durban  on Tuesday [1 March].    "We've laid a solid foundation for possible breakthroughs,"  said Mr Mandela at a press conference after the meeting. "We  have laid the ground plan for future progress."    On his party's stance on elections, Mr Buthelezi said:  "Provisional (registration) means it leaves our options open.  If a solution is found, it makes it possible for us to  participate." He said the IFP was determined to contest  elections, but he added that his party's demands, as contained  in the Freedom Alliance's proposals late last year, had to be  met. The Zulu king's demands also affected the IFP's  participation in elections: "If we had a federal solution, the  issue of the king would not have come up. We can in no way  ignore it."    The question of provisional registration had to be taken to  the IFP's Central Committee for ratification, he said.    Questioned on whether the IFP was closer to contesting  elections, he responded: "Not at all."    On his party's proposals to have the elections postponed, Mr  Buthelezi noted Mr Mandela and State President F W de Klerk had  made it clear this would not happen. But, he said, "we have not  even started campaigning...It's only fair to give us a little  space to campaign".    Asked about the Freedom Alliance, Mr Buthelezi said he  would have to consult his negotiation partners on IFP  participation in elections, but stressed the decision to  provisionally register for the poll was purely for the IFP. The  deadline for registration is Friday.    On international mediation, Mr Mandela said this was still  under consideration and had to be taken the party's principals.  [sentence as received]. Mr Mandela said later it was a  "mistake" to think the problems faced by the parties could have  been resolved overnight and he remained optimistic about future  meetings with the IFP president.    Both leaders said it was an "absolute certainty" they would  meet again soon to try to resolve their constitutional  differences. "In discussions of this nature there can be no  deadline. Not even April 27 is a deadline," said Mr Mandela.  "We'll continue searching for solutions even after April 27 if  we don't reach a solution now."    The leaders resolved to redouble their efforts to encourage  their constituencies to participate in and support National  Peace Accord structures and all peace initiatives. Both parties  also agreed to establish a task group to strengthen peace  committees and to allow communication between themselves. But  the primary responsibility for law and order remained with the  government, Mr Mandela and Mr Buthelezi noted in a joint  statement.    The leaders said they would work together to try to ensure  canvassing for their respective views could take place.    Commenting on the relationship between the ANC and IFP  leaders, Mr Mandela said in spite of their political differences  they were "very close friends...I came here in high spirits and  I'm leaving the meeting in higher spirits".    "It's sufficient for us to say we're satisfied with the  progress we've made," he added.</p>

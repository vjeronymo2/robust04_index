			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Cincinnati Bengal cornerback Lewis Billups says the team doctor gave him two  Valium tablets to ease leg cramps during a game against San Francisco Dec. 9,  "but . . . whoa, it was kind of hard to play football like that. I had to come  back out."  </P> <P> The doctor, Robert Heidt Jr., could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Valium is not among the NFL's banned substances, but because it is a  prescription drug administered only by a team physician, a report must be filed  to the league office, NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said.  </P> <P> Mark Siegel, a Cincinnati orthopedic surgeon who treats high school athletes,  said: "I'd hate to second-guess, but I'd be very cautious to give Valium to  someone who is going to perform a direct impact type of sport like football."  </P></p>

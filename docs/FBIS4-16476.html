			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Nika Stark report in the "Social Security Guarantees for </F> the President" column: "Secure Old Age Does Not Threaten Boris  Yeltsin Yet"]    [Text] While, according to the official version, the  Russian president is full of vigor and has no intention of  retiring, a strange document has appeared in the Duma concerning  the head of state's material insurance: both during the period  of his state service and after. This draft law -- On State  Social Security Guarantees for the Russian Federation President  -- which, according to Duma Deputy Chairman Mikhail Mityukov,  originated within the Legislation Committee, was however  assessed by this committee members as untimely.    The committee session also examined another draft law of  similar content: On State Guarantees to Top Officials. Both  bills were "promoted" at the Duma Council session by deputy  speaker Mikhail Mityukov who nonetheless denied authorship. At  the same time, Mityukov believes that such a law has a right to  exist because at the present moment, according to him, the  president's salary is approximately 400,000 rubles, that is,  below the deputies'. The draft establishes it at a level of  triple a ministerial salary.    Vladimir Isakov, chairman of the Legislation Committee,  assessed the bill as a possible provocation. In his opinion, a  wide discussion of the "juridically absolutely illiterate  document" can lead to the Duma's being charged with trying to  bring Boris Yeltsin's retirement closer (the draft envisions the  president's pension at 80 percent of his monthly monetary  allowance).    To avoid a scandal, the committee, after considering the  drafts, decided to wait and watch the reaction of factions and  parliamentary committees. The committee's decision may have  also been influenced by the fact that the anonymous law was  supposed to take effect from 1 April 1994.</p>

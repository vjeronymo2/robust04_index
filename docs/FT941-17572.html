			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Poles see role for Russia in expanded Nato Mr Andrzej Olechowski, Poland's foreign minister, wants Nato to set up a mechanism which would eventually enable east European countries to obtain full membership of the defence grouping. But he warned that Russia should not be isolated from the process. There could be no European security 'without the inclusion of a functioning democratic Russia', he said. 'A democratic and strong Russia would be the strongest guarantee of peace and stability in Europe.' Mr Olechowski's remarks came during an official visit to Bonn, and were detailed in an article in the liberal Frankfurter Rundschau daily newspaper. He said the 'partnership for peace,' the US-sponsored plan which envisages more co-operation with the countries of eastern Europe, did not go far enough in providing them with eventual guarantees of security. 'We understand that we cannot become Nato members overnight,' he said. 'But we expect that the partnership for peace is constructive in such a way that countries which went through a certain process would eventually attain to full membership.' The plan, he said, fell short of such expectations. Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister, said Bonn would act as Poland's 'defence lawyer' during next week's Nato summit. 'Because of our geographical situation following reunification. . . we have a particular responsibility and we bear this. We have a particular understanding of the countries of eastern Europe in terms of security needs,' he said. But Mr Kinkel, in contrast to the federal Defence Ministry which favours faster integration into Nato of east European countries, said 'a balanced and cautious procedure' on membership was needed.

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading INITIAL strength in Footsie futures faded as UK gilts and international bonds slipped and New York opened on a weak note, writes Joel Kibazo. Buyers of the June contract on the FT-SE 100 were seen in the first part of the session. Having opened at 2,856 it gained steadily reaching the day's high of 2,877 around 12 pm. It registered a healthy premium to cash at the higher levels and was also said to have helped pull the underlying cash market higher. However, the June contract began to drift lower on weakening sentiment in the gilts and a decline in the international bond markets. When Wall Street registered a negative start of trading, sellers of the June contract emerged driving it lower. It touched the day's low of 2,852 in the last half hour of trading and it finished at 2,859, three ahead of its previous close and around 4 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 12. Turnover reached 6,586 lots. The traded options were dull, and volume fell to 24,650, against Wednesday's 36,605 contracts. The Euro FT-SE 100 option was the busier of the two index options trading 5,361 lots, while the FT-SE 100 option saw business of 4,361 lots. In the stock options, British Steel, the subject of a buy recommendation from SG Warburg, was the busiest with a total of 2,124. It was followed by Boots at 1,549.</p>

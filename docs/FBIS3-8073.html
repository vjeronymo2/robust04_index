The agreement was reached in Gornji Vakuf today between  representatives of the Bosnia-Herzegovina army led by General  Muslimovic, and the Croat Defense Council led by General Vrbant,  Anning said.    Talks on the opening of six roads crossing the front lines  are due to start at the same time. These measures should enable  the implementation of the general cease-fire agreement and the  collection of weapons, which should come into effect at 1200 on  7 March. Weapons are to be collected in five or six locations  under UN supervision.</p>

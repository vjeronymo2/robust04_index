			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Andjelko Perincic from Rome for </F> Croatian radio]    [Excerpts] Mate Granic, the Croatian deputy prime minister  and foreign minister held talks with his Italian counterpart,  Beniamino Andreatta, in Rome this afternoon. They discussed the  development of bilateral relations and problems in our region.  [passage omitted]    [Begin Granic recording] Concerning the problems in the  region, we spent most of the time discussing Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Italy was interested in the accusations of the Croatian Army's  presence in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which I energetically refuted  and said that, according to our data, there are about 2,000  volunteers [from Croatia in Bosnia-Herzegovina] -- some of whom  were members of the Croatian Army -- but there are no military  units. Croatia is ready to allow the supervision of borders  between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. Of course, the UN  Security Council has recommended the supervision of all  Bosnia-Herzegovina's borders. Likewise, Croatia is not planning  any military action in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    We also discussed future negotiations with the Muslim side.  In the spirit of the EU's proposal and possible new proposals,  which are being discussed in the great circles of power, Croatia  is ready to immediately resume talks with the Muslim side. We  believe that the talks will soon take place.    It is in Croatia's great interest that all conflicts between  Croats and Muslims should end as soon as possible. Croatia  believes that a permanent solution to Croatian-Muslim relations  is the basis for one of the strategic guidelines of Croatia's  foreign policy.    Concerning the joint declaration signed by the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Croatia, it is  directed exclusively toward the normalization of state relations  and overall relations between Croats and Serbs, including  Croatia's priority, which is the reintegration of the UN  protected areas into Croatia's state and legal system.

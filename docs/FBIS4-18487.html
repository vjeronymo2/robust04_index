			<p>BFN     [Text] Dominique Baudis is the candidate of the French  Democratic Union [UDF] to lead the majority's European election  list next June. Two men, Dominique Baudis and Jean-Francois  Deniau, have been competing for the position. It is the mayor  of Toulouse who has been chosen by the UDF to lead the  majority's list. The Rally for the Republic [RPR] will  undoubtedly agree. The RPR and UDF recently agreed to present a  single list for the European elections. This single list will  probably be led by Dominique Baudis.</p>

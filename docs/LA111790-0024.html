			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIDTERM CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS  </P> <P> As a native Northern Californian born and raised in the "silver lining" above  Mendocino County, I strongly agree with Cockburn's column.  </P> <P> His cryptic outlook on the parties and their funding is realistic.  </P> <P> These corporations are piling money into these candidates for their own  welfare, not that of the community. It is time to realize the dangers we are  facing by allowing these multimillion-dollar firms to influence and run our  elections and our government.  </P> <P> It is indeed time that we as individuals who appreciate our freedom become  educated about the perils of corporate funding before we find our democracy  taken away by socialists in three-piece suits.  </P> <P> MELISSA J.

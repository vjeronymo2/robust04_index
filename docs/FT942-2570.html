			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Bulls in the driving seat at the LME Bullish speculators were active in nearly all London's leading commodity markets this week. At the London Metal Exchange highs were reached by aluminium (3-year), copper (21-month) and lead (20-month); the North Sea oil price spiked above Dollars 17 a barrel for the first time since last September; and London Commodity Exchange robusta coffee futures briefly touched 7 1/2 -year highs. One disappointment, however, was gold's relatively lacklustre response to deepening concern about the situation on the Korean peninsular. Copper's climb, which peaked yesterday morning when the three months delivery position touched Dollars 2,454 a tonne, added Dollars 61.50 to the Dollars 500 rally that began in mid-April. It continued to be fuelled by US investment fund buying, encouraged by the improving fundamentals for the metal. Aluminium's fundamental's are also perceived to be improving. Although LME warehouse stock remain at a near-record level a sustained drawdown is widely expected to begin soon as a result of the voluntary production cuts agreed by leading producing countries at a meeting in Brussels in January. This trend is also likely to be helped by increased demand for the metal by car manufacturers and builders. After being towed higher in copper's wake LME aluminium prices began to strengthen on their own account last week. And that performance was sustained as the market burst through successive resistance areas this week. At yesterday's close three months metal reached Dollars 1,470.50 a tonne, adding Dollars 64.25 to last week's Dollars 50 advance. A Dollars 26 rise yesterday was encouraged by news of a strike call at Norway's Elkem, which produces 20,000 tonnes a year at its two smelters. Lead's strength of late has been attributed chiefly to anticipation of increased buying by car battery manufacturers in preparation for the northern hemisphere winter. A further boost was given on Thursday, however, when Metaleurop, a Preussag subsidiary, announced that it planned to halt primary supply for two months to help reverse the recent heavy build-up in stocks. That should take about 30,000 tonnes out of the market. The news contributed to a Dollars 7.25 rise yesterday that left the three months LME price Dollars 19.50 up on the week at Dollars 559.75 a tonne. The oil market had several bullish factors to feed off. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided at its Vienna meeting this week to keep its production ceiling unchanged and cancel the scheduled September meeting. That bolstered confidence in the cartel's determination to keep output under control while it awaited an expected pick up in demand. Short term demand has been increased, meanwhile, by supply bottlenecks in the US. With the North Korean situation spicing the dish the August futures position at London's International Petroleum Exchange jumped to a peak of Dollars 17.06 a barrel on Thursday before edging back. Coffee futures were all over the place this week. The LCE's September position traded in a Dollars 290 range before closing yesterday at Dollars 2,335 a tonne, up Dollars 187 on balance, but Dollars 155 off the high. The market got off to a flying start, buoyed by a US Department of Agriculture forecast that 1994-95 world output would be down 4 per cent at 90.6m bags (60kg each). The buying that encouraged continued - though somewhat erratically - until the price peaked early on Thursday.  --------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  --------------------------------------------- Aluminium         -7,300  to  2,654,225 Aluminium alloy     -440  to     30,620 Copper            -6,600  to    360,850 Lead                +450  to    359,575 Nickel               +24  to    131,934 Zinc                 +75  to  1,192,150 Tin                 +395  to     30,140  ---------------------------------------------</p>

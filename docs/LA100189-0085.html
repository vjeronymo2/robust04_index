			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'UC DIAMOND BAR': BOTH CITY, COUNTY LIKE THE SOUND OF IT  </P> <P> It's just one among 50 cities in the state that have flooded the University of  California with letters and phone calls, each wanting to host one of the three  new UC campuses to be built by the beginning of the 21st Century.  </P> <P> But with the recent endorsement of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors,  Diamond Bar officials are optimistic that their city of 46,700 people will  catch the attention of university officials.  </P> <P> "We meet all the qualifications," Diamond Bar Councilman John Forbing said. "We  have low-cost housing in the area, transportation, open land, freeway access,  and there are jobs available."  </P> <P> On Monday, the supervisors voted 3 to 0, with Deane Dana and Kenneth Hahn  absent, to support the concept of UC Diamond Bar. The motion, proposed by  Supervisor Pete Schabarum, was amended to also suggest building a campus in the  Antelope Valley. Among the several other Los Angeles County cities that have  asked for a campus are Lancaster, Palmdale and Santa Clarita.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Logical Area'  </P> <P> Meanwhile, on Wednesday a member of the legislative analyst's staff testified  before the Senate Education Committee that the three new campuses are  unnecessary.  </P> <P> The county resolution says Diamond Bar is a "logical area for this new Southern  California campus. . . . The surrounding San Gabriel Valley, Pomona and Walnut  Valley areas are mature communities with diverse population as characterized by  ethnic, economic and age demographics. There is strong community support and  facilities, including medical, educational, environmental, transportation,  communication and housing."  </P> <P> Last year, the UC Board of Regents determined that three new campuses are  needed to absorb the impact of burgeoning enrollment at the nine existing  campuses. Officials indicated that one will probably be built in Northern  California, one in Southern California and one in the Central Valley.  </P> <P> By Oct. 19, a group of consultants will have narrowed the list to 50 to 60  possible sites. That list will be shortened to 15 by February, 1990, and to  eight by next July. In October, 1990, the final three will be selected.  Construction of the campuses, each estimated to cost $300 million, will start  by the end of 1991.  </P> <P> As the deadline approaches, UC headquarters in Oakland has been flooded with  expressions of interest from chambers of commerce, city and county officials,  and residents all over the state, university spokesman Rick Malaspina said.  </P> <P> Diamond Bar sent UC the council's resolution shortly after it passed. Other  cities are taking more elaborate measures. In Redding in Northern California,  Malaspina said, T-shirts are for sale sporting UC's blue and gold emblem along  with the hopeful message "I support UC Redding." Officials there have also sent  the university a videotape of the area. And in Mariposa, seventh-graders at a  local school have started a letter-writing campaign.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in Palm Springs, Mayor Sonny Bono has written a letter to the  university boasting about his area's many amenities.  </P> <P> Said Forbing of Diamond Bar's decidedly low-key approach: "I would imagine  printing up T-shirts isn't going to have a whole lot of do with the regents'  decision."  </P></p>

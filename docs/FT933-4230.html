			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Foreign demand fuels Brazil BRAZILIAN equities showed fresh strength at midsession in response to foreign demand, but lost some ground later on moderate profit-taking. The Bovespa index was finally a net 133, or 1.1 per cent, ahead at 11,751, after touching 12,236. Equities have been attracting interest after the government announced its intention to tackle inflation, currently at a monthly level of 34 per cent, by adopting fiscal reform measures and accelerating the privatisation programme. BUENOS AIRES reversed a fresh retreat on profit-taking to close higher on the day in response to late news of the approval by key Senate committees of a draft for a pensions reform bill. The weighted Merval index, which initially lost 3 per cent, finished a net 1 per cent up at 482.60.</p>

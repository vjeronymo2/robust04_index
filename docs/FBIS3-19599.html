			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Achille Occhetto, secretary of the </F> Democratic Party of the Left, by unidentified foreign  correspondents in Rome on 16 March: "I Do Not Want To Burn  Either My Wings or Those of Ciampi"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Correspondent] The war in  Yugoslavia is closer to Rome than it is to Milan. Why do you  talk so little about it?    [Occhetto] This is not true; we do talk about it. Italy's  commitment was a fervid one and this is demonstrated by the  victims of our information industry, to whom my thoughts go out.  The PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] also declared itself in  favor of the participation of the Italian blue berets in an  international operation, precisely because of the exceptional  nature of the situation and because of the need to strengthen  and stabilize the truce. The condition being the request of the  UN secretary general and the consensus of all the sides  involved. I also recall that since we were at NATO precisely  when the first air attack was launched, I stated that I agreed  with the action. I only manifested concern over a possible  counterstroke by the Russians. We continue to consider the  mediation initiated by Moscow as being decisive in order to go  ahead.    [Correspondent] The Right still accuses you of being  Bolsheviks, responsible for revolutionary crimes, and at the  same time of not having offered any clear opposition to the  kickback scandal...    [Occhetto] There is in effect a contradiction here. I will  let the historians judge our "Bolshevism." [Forza Italia  leader] Berlusconi is the only one in Europe to talk of a  "communist danger" in Italy... There could be some truth in the  second accusation. During the laborious construction of Italian  democracy there were cases of associationism, some were  virtuous, others were not. The latter wet the wings of our  capacity to act as an opposition, also because our political  system was blocked. The PDS was born precisely in order to  overcome the heart of this situation, by criticizing the system  of straight proportional representation and fighting for a  system of alternatives in which all the citizens can make a  decision on the government and the prime minister.    [Correspondent] What will happen in Italy if the Right wins?  Or if nobody wins: How can a government be guaranteed?    [Occhetto] I see a straight-out victory of Berlusconi  leading  him to the seat of prime minister as being difficult.  Berlusconi himself knows, as I know, that the electoral tests  are not positive for Forza Italia, so much so that he has  started to talk of an institutional or constituent government.  In any case, I hope that the progressives will be the central  force, around which a solution can be built. Every day brings a  new problem though and we will think about this after the  elections.    [Correspondent] Is there really a "diversity" between the  PDS  and the progressives on the moral issue?    [Occhetto] We have never spoken of an "anthropological"  diversity. But our reaction was different. With great  frankness and honesty we apologized to the Italians and for a  lot less than what the others did. And the trials will end up  showing that we had no connection with the kickback scandal, a  system that involved not only the politicians but also corrupt  businessmen who distorted the market. We then supported the  meritorious work of justice, even though there may have been  excesses or errors. For 11 months we were nailed down by the  episode of a single Swiss bank account that was not ours. One  of our members was arrested and then freed by the court. We  bore the series of difficulties in a Christian spirit. The most  important task is really to clean things up.    [Correspondent] If the progressive pole wins, will you be  the  future prime minister?    [Occhetto] The victory of the progressives will bring with  it  the problem of presenting a prime minister and a team. It will  have to be resolved with great wisdom, and with the attention  focused on creating a climate of security, certainty, and  tranquillity. There is no need to propose candidates now. Laws  that do not exist should not be mimicked, like the election of  the prime minister. I will not be involved in drawing-room  games with people throwing themselves off the tower. What sense  is there in saying "I will candidate myself"? Or to candidate  [Prime Minister] Ciampi who said -- and did well to say so --  that he wants to remain above the fray? I have affirmed from  the beginning that Ciampi remains a resource for our democracy.  Proposing him now could mean damaging him. And I do not want  to burn either Occhetto's or Ciampi's wings...    [Correspondent] Do you consider yourself to be a better  social democrat than your adversaries?    [Occhetto] It does not take much to be more of a liberal  democrat than Berlusconi. And I come from Turin, the city of  Gramsci and Gobetti. Stalin is not part of my training. When I  came up against him, of course not personally, I fought him,  asking for the reinstatement of Luxemburg and Trotsky in "Nuova  Generazione." I must say that Togliatti let me do as I pleased,  he was fundamentally more "liberal" than people thought.  Berlusconi is a liberal democrat who seems to have problems  with the United Kingdom. It was in this very room that he got  upset with a British journalist who reminded him of his  television monopoly. He was to have appeared on "Milano Italia"  [third channel TV program], but then said no when he heard that  another British journalist was going to be there. The terror of  the "perfidious Albion" was nourished by only one other person  in Italy...    [Correspondent] Rete and Communist Renewal have different  positions on Ciampi, treasury bills, and NATO. How will the  progressives explain this overseas?    [Occhetto] I think that propaganda is of little interest  overseas. The treasury bills issue has been built up. Even  economists like Monti and Martino agree with [Communist Renewal  Secretary] Bertinotti's thesis, which is not like speaking badly  of the Madonna. We consider it wrong not as a matter of  principle, but because realism tells us that this is not the  path to take in order to fight the government deficit. I have  reason to believe that, if we get elected, Communist Renewal  would accept what was agreed upon at the progressive table. At  NATO I had the feeling that no general considered Bertinotti's  hypothesis of having Italy withdraw from the alliance as being  realistic.    [Correspondent] Would the Left be responsible for a possible  advancement of the Right in Italy? And would you govern with  Berlusconi?    [Occhetto] The League has advanced in the north because we  did not always do our duty. We should have broken up the town  council alliances with [former Socialist leader] Craxi before.  However, the real cause behind the growth toward the Right is  the disintegration of the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and  its old system of power. After the victory of the progressive  mayors it was natural for the Right to reorganize itself. But  instead of a modern and civil Right, a worrying, ideological  force has entered into the field. Even for this reason I rule  out any government with Berlusconi. I think that the  progressives will get the majority, and will present their  government proposal to the president of the republic.</p>

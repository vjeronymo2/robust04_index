			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Barclays sells Australian retail and finance side Barclays, the UK clearing bank, yesterday announced the sale of its retail banking and finance company operations in Australia to the St George Bank, the New South Wales-based regional bank, for ADollars 190.5m. (Pounds 93.8m) Barclays, however, will continue to operate as an investment bank in Australia. It is retaining a range of activities there - including corporate finance, structured finance, corporate banking, foreign exchange and fund management. These will now be managed by the BZW division within Barclays. Simultaneously, Barclays announced that it had been granted branch banking authority in Australia - one of only a handful of foreign banks to receive branch banking authority under the Australian government's new foreign bank policy. The government announced a liberalisation of bank entry in 1992, in an effort to promote competition in the sector. Mr Tim Crammond, chief executive of BZW in Australia, said the sale was in line with Barclays' decision to concentrate on retail banking in the UK, Europe and Africa, but to have a broader geographical base for its investment banking operations. Mr Crammond said that the decision to sell the retail interests had been 'difficult'. 'Divestment of profitable activities is always a hard decision to make,' he commented. The businesses being sold had assets of about ADollars 2bn, and made profits of ADollars 30.4m last year. They include 18 bank branches, mainly in Sydney's western suburbs. Assets at St George will rise to about ADollars 14.5bn as a result.</p>

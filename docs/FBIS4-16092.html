			<p>BFN     [Text] Legal suits demanding 1.5 Bn [billion] rubles in  total for the protection of honor and dignity were brought by  the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy against Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, St.  Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak, the State Duma deputy Yegor  Gaydar, and retired KGB Major General Oleg Kalugin,  Zhirinovskiy's lawyer Sergey Belyak reported to Interfax on  Wednesday.    In his words, the statements of these people addressed to  Zhirinovskiy "touching upon his honor and dignity and inflicting  moral damage" are the major reason for these claims. In  particular, during the pre-election campaign Gaydar compared  Zhirinovskiy with Adolf Hitler. In addition, there were  assertions that Zhirinovskiy "is an agent of special forces and  the work of the KGB."    As Belyak reported, the greatest sum, totaling 500 Mn  [million] rubles is requested from Yegor Gaydar. According to  Belyak, Zhirinovskiy explains this by the fact that "such  statements made many electors "afraid of his candidacy." The  rest are proposed to pay 300 Mn rubles each. In addition, the  newspaper KURANTY which published several statement which  allegedly belonged to Zhirinovskiy was being sued for 100 Mn  rubles.    In his conversation with our Interfax correspondent Belyak  inidicated that "such great sums" are explained "by the  infectiousness of a bad example," to quote Zhirinovskiy. He  pointed to Aleksandr Rutskoy who also brought claims against his  political opponents. "The need of appropriate monetary funds to  repair the office" is the major reason for "the moral damage's  compensation" because Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin  "refused to render any material aid on this issue," said Belyak.</p>

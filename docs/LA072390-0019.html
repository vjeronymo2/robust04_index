			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> SMITHSONIAN TO CUT STAFF, PROGRAMS  </P> <P> Facing deep budget cuts, the Smithsonian Institution will impose layoffs,  abolish some existing programs and cancel planned expansion, Smithsonian  Secretary Robert McC.  </P> <P> Adams said. Adams said he expects the creation of the American Indian museum to  proceed, but virtually everything else is in question. Some of the endangered  projects are a $300-million annex to the National Air and Space Museum at  Dulles Airport, expansion of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden and the  addition of "badly needed" storage space at the Museum Support Center in  Suitland, Md.  </P></p>

Villegas] </F>   [Text] Amid reports on the possible breakdown of trade  talks between the United States and Japan and Washington's  perceived threat of withdrawing most favored nation (MFN) status  on China over human rights issues, Foreign Affairs Secretary  Roberto Romulo reiterated the Philippines' concerns for an early  conclusion of the aforementioned conflicts.    Mr. Romulo raised this matter after meeting with his  counterpart, Foreign Minister Prince Mohamed Bolkiah of Brunei  and Abdul Rahman Bin Mohamed Taib, Minister of Industry and  Primary Resources in the tiny oil-rich state, the other night.    Mr. Romulo said Washington's trade conflicts with Tokyo and  Beijing are counterproductive to the collective efforts of the  Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in helping realize the  organization's desire to facilitate the flow of trade among its  17 members.    "The countries in the region cannot help but be affected by  these difficulties," the foreign affairs chief said, as trade  talks between the United States and Japan, as well as those  between the United States and China, seem to have been  inconclusive and have failed to adequately address the concerns  of the parties.    He called on Washington, Tokyo, and Beijing to view their  bilateral trade issues in the context of further encouraging  trade and economic development in the region. "The Philippines  is calling on all parties concerned to come to terms and resolve  these trade issues before it adversely affects the stability of  the region," he added.    The United States and Japan have been trying to address the  latter's massive trade surplus over the former. On the other  hand, Washington has been linking the granting of MFN status to  the alleged failure of Beijing to prevent human rights  violations in China.    Mr. Romulo earlier raised these concerns during the recent  call on him by Australian Trade Minister Bob McMullan in the  country.    "Countries in the region are all trying to agree on the kind  of process we should take in order to solve trade problems  affecting us instead of having two of our largest trading  partners go directly head on with each other in ways that are  not of interests to other economies on this side of the globe,"  the Australian Trade Minister earlier said.    In an interview with BUSINESS WORLD before departing for  Kuala Lumpur last Saturday, Mr. McMullan said Australia wants  the nascent APEC to become "more effective" by promoting trade  liberalization in the region.    He said Canberra's priorities at the moment regarding APEC's  role in the region is focused on addressing trade matters that  would help developing countries benefit from their trade  relations with the industrialized ones.    Although Australia has been vocal on the  institutionalization  of APEC, Mr. McMullan said Canberra does not see this move as a  priority at the moment.    "A lot of people in Asia have different views on this," he  said, referring to the proposed transformation of APEC into a  more formal structure.    "Australia is quite relaxed on the institutionalization of  APEC. We don't want to press too far on that," he added.    "Whether we come to agree on this matter or not, the best  way  to address APEC's future direction is to do it by consensus. No  single (member) country in APEC pretends to have all the answers  on APEC's future. Everyone's searching. Whether APEC becomes  institutionalized or not is unimportant ... although the  establishment of a Secretariat in Singapore seems to indicate  that APEC is probably becoming institutionalized already," the  Trade Minister said.    He said Australia would rather have two sides of the Pacific  work together instead of being in conflict with each other.    "That is essentially our priority. If the best way to  realize APEC's goals is to institutionalize the organization,  then, so be it. But if it's not that necessary, then it's not a  priority for us," said Mr. McMullan.    APEC groups together Australia, Brunei, Canada, China, Hong  Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New  Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, South  Korea, and the United States. Chile is expected to join the  organization when the APEC ministers meet this November in  Indonesia for their annual talks.</p>

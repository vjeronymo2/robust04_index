			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A hearing is scheduled July 14 in Kern County Superior Court in Bakersfield to  determine if the United Farm Workers union should be permanently restrained  from using a photograph of a boy born without arms and legs to promote its  table grape boycott. Last week, Judge Roger Randall issued a temporary  restraining order against the union's use of the picture of 8-year-old Felipe  Franco of Delano. The boy's parents sued the union for invasion of privacy  after it used the picture as an example of the effects of pesticides. UFW  attorneys contended that the Francos signed a release form. UFW leader Cesar  Chavez began the grape boycott in 1984, contending that the use of pesticides  posed a threat to vineyard workers and consumers. Grape industry officials have  denied the union's charges.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WITHDRAW LICENSE OF CREATION SCIENCE SCHOOL, PANEL URGES  </P> <P> A State Board of Education evaluation team has recommended that state approval  be removed from a school in San Diego County that is the only creation science  school in the country offering master's degrees.  </P> <P> The team's report recommends stripping the mantle of state legitimacy from the  Institute for Creation Research in Santee.  </P> <P> The report "seems reasonable to me," State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill  Honig said, although he will not act on the recommendation for a month or so.  </P> <P> Withdrawal of the state license might mean the end for the institute, which has  provided some of the intellectual underpinning for the argument that God, not  scientific forces, created the Earth.  </P> <P> John Morris, administrative vice president of the institute, said the report  was part of "a very insidious plot" on Honig's part to "establish a state  religion in California" that would be "anti-creationist" in nature.  </P> <P> Morris said he had received no word of the evaluation team's report but added,  "obviously we'll appeal if the ruling goes against us."  </P> <P> The institute has been authorized to grant master's degrees in biology,  geology, physics and science education since 1981 but has awarded only about 20  degrees in that time, Morris added.  </P> <P> For more than a year Honig has been trying to drop state approval because he  thinks the school teaches religion, not science.  </P> <P> The evaluation report, written by a team of five college and university  scientists who visited the institute for several days last August, touches only  lightly on this controversy but does find that the institute's offerings are  not comparable with other higher education institutions.  </P> <P> The institute curriculum "is not consistent in quality with curricula offered  by appropriate established accredited institutions," the report says, and its  courses "are not comparable to the courses required of graduates" of accredited  schools.  </P> <P> The report says the faculty has produced little reputable research, the library  and laboratories are inadequate and the courses do not prepare students to be  science teachers, which is one of the institute's main goals.  </P> <P> Although the evaluators generally sidestepped the creationism issue, they did  mention some of the problems involved in trying to do creation science  research.  </P> <P> For instance, the report said that the institute's attempt to prove that the  Earth's geological state was caused primarily by the flood of Noah described in  the biblical book of Genesis fails to address these questions: "Where did all  the water of the flood come from? How did it come down? Where did the water  eventually go after the flood?"  </P> <P> Honig said the negative findings, and the recommendation that state approval be  lifted, were unanimous on the part of the five-member team, which included two  science faculty members from UCLA, one from UC San Diego, one from California  State University, Long Beach, and one from Cedarville College, in Cedarville,  Ohio.  </P> <P> But the report states that Leroy E. Eimers, professor of physics and  mathematics at Cedarville College, disagreed with some of the findings and  recommended that state approval be continued for the master's degree programs  in geology, physics and science education but not in biology. Eimers was named  to the evaluation group at the suggestion of the Institute for Creation  Research.  </P> <P> This is Honig's second encounter with the forces of creation science in recent  months.  </P> <P> In November, after a dispute that lasted several months, the State Board of  Education adopted curriculum guidelines for science textbooks that stress the  teaching of evolution as theory but delete references to evolution as  scientific fact.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEXT STEP  </P> <P> The evaluation team's recommendations next go to the Council for Private  Postsecondary Educational Institutions, an 18-member body that will meet in  late February and will recommend that Honig accept or reject the report. If  Honig agrees with the recommendations, state certification will be revoked.  </P></p>

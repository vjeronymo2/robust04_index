			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Watchdog begins Granada inquiry THE Independent Television Commission will today start investigating claims by Mrs Ann Clwyd, the shadow heritage secretary, that Granada Television is in breach of its licence. Sir George Russell, commission chairman, yesterday received a letter from Mrs Clwyd asking him to consider revoking Granada's licence and accusing the commission of being in default of its statutory duties for not taking action sooner. A copy of the dossier which talks of 'boardroom savagery' and a television company 'having its heart ripped out' has also been sent to Mr Peter Brooke, heritage secretary. Mrs Clwyd's paper lists the number of Granada Television directors who have left or been fired since the company bid for its new licence. Only two are left out of 13. A further 25 senior people 'have disappeared', the study claims, saying they include the head of documentaries and arts, the chief engineer and head of sound. A total of 370 staff have lost their jobs or face redundancy at Granada. Granada boasted in its application about its research in broadcast engineering. But Mrs Clwyd claimed the people responsible have gone. The commission is likely to be more interested to see whether Granada is fulfilling the terms of its licence than carrying out the promises in its application. In particular the commission will want to ensure that Granada is providing a good quality service of regional broadcasting.</p>

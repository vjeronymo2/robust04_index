			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Biondi turns the tables on his tormentors: Minister's resignation offer could rebound on investigating magistrates who have criticised him The on-off resignation yesterday of Mr Alfredo Biondi, Italy's justice minister, looks like the mirror-image of the events of July. Then, it was Italy's most famous anti-corruption magistrates - Milan's Mani Pulite (clean hands) team - who offered their resignation after Mr Biondi tabled a decree banning the use of preventive detention in bribery and corruption investigations. The public outcry forced the government into a humiliating reversal of its policy, and the magistrates returned to their posts. Mr Biondi's resignation - offered in the morning, refused by the cabinet, and then withdrawn in the afternoon - was in protest at comments by Mr Francesco Saverio Borrelli, the Milan prosecutor who is in charge of the Mani Pulite team. But in spite of its similarities, it may have more serious implications for Italy than the July saga of the magistrates' resignation. It comes at the end of a torrid four weeks in which the magistrates, in particular Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the best-known member of the Milan team, have been accused of wanting to enter the political arena, a possibility which has made even opponents of Mr Silvio Berlusconi's government uneasy. In the interview, the daily Corriere della Sera quotes Mr Borrelli as saying that the magistrates have reached 'a crucial moment' in their investigations. In particular, he warns of the risk that their inquiry into alleged corruption at Telepiu, the pay-television channel founded by Mr Berlusconi and since sold to other investors, 'could also reach extremely high financial and political levels'. In the interview, Mr Borrelli, who refused to comment yesterday on the repercussions, went on to attack Mr Biondi, not only for his conduct as a minister but also in his previous job as a top defence lawyer. Mr Biondi could not simply sack Mr Borrelli for his remarks, because only the magistrature's governing body, which is now relatively independent of political control, can dismiss magistrates. However, the minister's offer to resign is an indication that Mr Borrelli, who is normally a shrewd player of media and public opinion, may have finally overstepped the mark. On Tuesday, Mr Berlusconi, whose Fininvest business empire is currently the object of seven different legal investigations, accused the magistrates of distorting justice for political ends. But this is an opinion now shared by a growing number of observers outside the government. This could turn into a backlash against the magistrates, who until now have had almost a free hand to investigate widespread corruption. The Milan magistrates lent fuel to the accusation of dabbling in politics in September, when they outlined legislative proposals for clearing up the long-running corruption investigation. Mr Di Pietro himself has not helped matters by publishing a book on the Italian constitution, with a foreword by the wily former Italian president Mr Francesco Cossiga, who said the work marked Mr Di Pietro's 'entry into politics' and signalled 'an exit route from the crisis for the country'. At the weekend Mr Rocco Buttiglione, leader of the opposition Popular party, the former Christian Democrats, warned that corruption accusations might be levelled at Mr Berlusconi, allowing Mr Di Pietro to become prime minister as the candidate of the extreme right coalition party, the National Alliance. Meanwhile, lawyers for Mr Sergio Cusani - the financier prosecuted by Mr Di Pietro and jailed for corruption earlier this year - have lodged a complaint against the magistrate, accusing him of slander and abuse of office during the trial. Mr Di Pietro has vowed not to make any more public statements until after the latest corruption trial, in which he is again prosecuting. Yesterday, in a courtroom exchange with one witness, he said he had no intention of taking part in political campaigns. That approach may prove the most fruitful for the magistrates, who are only now reaching the core of their latest investigation into the alleged bribery of anti-fraud police by big Italian companies. If the government decides to use this latest excuse to rein in the magistrates' powers, then the latest phase of cleaning up Italy's political and business regime could be stalled.</p>

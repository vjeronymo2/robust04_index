			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / French threaten summit boycott in trade row FRANCE has threatened to boy-cott this week's emergency European Community summit in Birmingham if the EC makes concessions to the US on subsidised farm trade in negotiations which opened in Brussels yesterday. The French threat risks derailing the finely balanced talks which are widely seen as the last chance this year to settle a two-year farm trade dispute which has stalled plans - the so-called Gatt Uruguay Round - to liberalise world trade. Last night, Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, said no progress had been made at Brussels. 'We are much too far from the goal,' he said, adding that France wanted an accord 'but not to the detriment of its vital interests'. EC officials were told last week that French president Francois Mitterrand would refuse to attend the Birmingham summit if he was put under pressure to endorse concessions in the Uruguay Round that were unacceptable to his government. The message was delivered by Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, the French farm minister, during talks in Brussels with Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, and Mr Frans Andriessen, the Dutch commissioner responsible for external affairs. Mr Soisson also warned of a farmers' revolt if new concessions were made, according to several EC officials. Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, offered France assurances before yesterday's meeting that any agreement would require consensus within the Community, although Paris technically cannot veto a deal. 'It is not a matter of out-voting the French,' he said. Until today's resumption of the talks - which could continue tomorrow - both sides are saying nothing on the detail of the negotiations. An official said: 'Everyone is very conscious of the situation in France at the moment. The French farm minister has been making it plain in Brussels how difficult it is going to be to achieve support in France for the kind of Uruguay Round deal that negotiators are currently talking about.' A French boycott of Birmingham would sink hopes of presenting a much-needed display of EC unity. French fears have risen in response to signals that President George Bush is anxious to seal a deal in order to bolster his re-election campaign. Likewise, US farm lobbies last week warned that the administration was on the brink of a 'sell-out'. Yesterday's Brussels talks, held amid very tight secrecy. involved Mrs Carla Hills, special US trade representative, Mr Andriessen, Mr MacSharry, and Mr Ed Madigan, the US agriculture secretary. First to meet were Mrs Hills and Mr Andriessen. Apart from farm trade, it was expected that they would discuss obstacles to settlement of the Uruguay Round - principally disputes over multilateral tariff cuts and liberalisation of world trade in services. France is Europe's leading ex-porter both of services and farm products. It had been hoped that French negotiators could be persuaded to accept concessions on subsidised food exports - its farm trade accounts for just 3.2 per cent of its GDP - in return for significant gains in services. But French officials say they have little flexibility in the light of the powerful No vote by French farmers on Maastricht. Progress on farm talks has been blocked on two critical issues: The EC's refusal to accept a 24 per cent cut in the volume of subsidised farm exports in addition to a 36 per cent cut in their value. EC insistence that compensation to European farmers for price cuts agreed in May's reform of the Common Agricultural Policy should not be regarded as subsidies. The proposed Uruguay Round agreement demands a 20 per cent cut in domestic farm subsidies over six years. EC negotiators will be pressing for a smaller volume cut - a figure of 21 per cent has been mentioned - and for 'aggregation', which would allow the EC to make smaller cuts in sensitive areas, counterbalanced by deeper cuts elsewhere.

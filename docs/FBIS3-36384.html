According to reports received by KOMMERSANT-DAILY, the  Tatarstan president is to arrive in Moscow this weekend to  discuss with the Russian president the final conditions for  signing an interstate treaty. The document, which will be  unprecedented for the Russian Federation, will give Tatarstan --  one of the most powerful components in economic terms -- a  special status compared with other regions.    Mintimer Shaymiyev's views on Russia's structure differ from  Boris Yeltsin's. In the Tatarstan president's opinion, the  federation should be built not from Moscow, but from the  regions, which will hand over to the center only those powers  they are unable to exercise on their own. At the same time,  Mintimer Shaymiyev consistently dismisses charges that the  republic is going to secede from the federation. "What we are  standing for is not a secession from Russia, but treaty-based  relations and a voluntary transfer of a number of powers to the  center. Tatarstan does not plan to set up its own army, or to  erect a border, or to quit the ruble zone," he said in one of  his interviews.    Tatarstan Vice President Vasiliy Likhachev conducted talks  with Viktor Chernomyrdin, Yuriy Yarov, and Sergey Shakhray to  settle with them the last five agreements on which the treaty  "On the Delegation of Terms of Reference and Powers of State  Authorities" will actually be based. There is a total of 12  agreements, out of which seven were signed last year, when  Tatarstan had its way by skillfully playing on the conflict  between the president and the Russian Supreme Soviet.    Reports that Tatarstan is ready to take part in the new  elections for the Federal Assembly scheduled for 13 March and  that Mintimer Shaymiyev and Farid Mukhametshin are even going to  run for the Federal Assembly's upper chamber suggest that the  remaining five agreements will also be signed. Evidently, this  is the price Kazan will have to pay for a treaty that will  recognize the sovereignty of a republic where Boris Yeltsin,  then a candidate for the Russian presidency, made a statement  that secured him support from the regions: "Take as much  sovereignty as you can digest."    In mid-February Boris Yeltsin will leave for Kazan to reap  the first fruits of that statement. Afterward, however, no one  will be able to say whether they will be the last ones or  whether other republics will follow Tatarstan's suit.  Predicting whether Kazan's appetites will be satisfied by a  bilateral treaty will be just as difficult a task.   <H3>    A list of agreements on the basis of which the treaty  between Russia and Tatarstan will be concluded </H3>   Signed in 1993    Agreements on the prospecting and production of oil; on  ownership matters; on the mutual delegation of powers regarding  defense industries; on customs; on the organization and  transportation of oil and oil products; on environmental  cooperation; on education policy.    Expected to be signed in February 1994    Agreements on the budget; on the banking system; on foreign  economic activity; on combating crime; on military organization.   <H5>    Commentary </H5>   A special relationship between Tatarstan and Moscow has been  determined primarily by the federal authorities' interest in  maintaining their influence in a region that is strategically  important for the Russian economy. It is there that a number of  Russia's largest monopolistic enterprises, such as KamAZ,  "Kazanorgsintez," and "Tasma," are located. The republic  accounts for 40 percent of polyethylene; 34 percent of  thermoplastic tubes; 100 percent of motion picture and photo  films; and 53 percent of diesel trucks manufactured in Russia.  Moscow's considerable dependence on Kazan for various  industrial products has been compounded by Tatarstan's monopoly  of military aircraft and helicopter production (Tu-160 Blackjack  and Tu-22M3 Backfire strategic bombers, Mi-8, Mi-8MTB, Mi-9, and  Mi-17 multipurpose helicopters). So, serious arguments in a  dialogue with Moscow have made Tatarstan, along with Yakutia, an  "ice breaker" in pushing through regional export quotas. Last  year, the republic was given a quota to export 8 million tonnes  of oil out of the 25 million tonnes it produced. The federal  authorities, however, have just as weighty economic trump cards.  In particular, they may capitalize on extremely scanty natural  gas reserves in Tatarstan. More important, however, is the  problem of the republic's independent sales of its production,  primarily oil. It is not only the need to use Russian oil  pipelines that matters. Tatar oil, given its high sulfur  content, does not hold particular interest for foreign  consumers. This is the reason it is mixed with Tyumen oil to  obtain a product known on the world market as "Soviet export  mix."</p>

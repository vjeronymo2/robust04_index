			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / US third quarter results revised Strong inventory-building helped the US economy to grow a little more strongly during the third quarter than previously thought, the Commerce Department said yesterday. GDP expanded at a 4 per cent annual rate in the quarter rather than the 3.9 per cent estimated a month ago, the government said in a final revision of the quarterly GDP figure. It was the second upward revision in third-quarter GDP. Originally it was reported growing at a 3.4 per cent annual rate. 'The general picture of economic activity is little changed from last month: consumer, investment and government spending more than accounted for the increase in real GDP, with one half of the increase attributable to consumer spending,' the department said. Businesses built up inventories during the third quarter at an annual rate of Dollars 57.1bn, even stronger than the estimate a month ago of Dollars 56.1bn.</p>

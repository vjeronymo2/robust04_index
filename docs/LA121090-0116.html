			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE;  </P> <P> EX-SEN. CARPENTER SENT TO JAIL  </P> <P> Paul Carpenter, a former legislative leader convicted of shaking down special  interests for campaign contributions, was sentenced today to 12 years in  federal prison.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Edward Garcia, rejecting the prosecutor's request for a  15-year term, said Carpenter will be eligible for parole in four years.  </P> <P> Garcia also refused a defense request that Carpenter be given probation and  required to perform community service.  </P> <P> The silver-haired Carpenter, 62, stood silently while sentence was pronounced  by Garcia, who described the evidence against him as "overwhelming." The judge  said he selected the 12-year sentence to punish Carpenter and to deter others.  </P> <P> Carpenter was convicted in September of engaging in racketeering, extortion and  conspiracy. Prosecutors said he used his former Senate office to extract  campaign contributions from special interests.  </P></p>

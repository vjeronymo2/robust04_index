			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Markets surge to new peaks: FT-SE 100 breaks 3,100 as European equities defy Bundesbank rates stance LONDON SHARES joined other European stock markets yesterday in soaring to record levels, in defiance of the Bundesbank's refusal on Thursday to cut interest rates. In London the FT-SE 100 index broke through 3,100, closing 21.4 points higher at 3,100.6, two weeks after breaking through the 3,000 barrier for the first time. The Paris CAC-40 index closed at a record 2,183.88, up 10.27 points. The Madrid and Lisbon bourses both reached their high points for the year. The German DAX index closed 3.45 points up at 1,904.60, only 4 per cent short of the peak reached in April 1990 in the euphoria following the fall of the Berlin Wall. Sterling closed at DM2.50, down 1 1/2 pfennigs on the day and down 3 3/4 pfennigs on the week. In late New York trading sterling was trading at DM2.4999. In London, analysts attributed the performance of equities to confidence in UK economic recovery, encouraged by the Confederation of British Industry which raised to 3 per cent its growth forecast for gross domestic product next year. Equities were also driven by strong gains in domestic bond markets, as investors remained confident that inflation would stay low and falling interest rates in continental Europe would allow UK rates to be cut further. 'It would take something very negative and totally unexpected to push this market down and hold it there,' said Mr Richard Jeffrey of Charterhouse Tilney. 'We're seeing increasing confirmation of recovery. The rally will continue,' he added. 'Interest rates are coming down across Europe, and the only question is the timing,' said Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull, the London securities arm of Societe Generale. Analysts said the UK market may have already factored into share prices a possible reduction in UK base rates to 5 per cent from the present 6 per cent. Some suggested that rates could be cut to 4 per cent, perhaps by the year-end. Trading volume in UK equities has risen this month to record daily levels for 1993, with US investors particularly heavy buyers this week. The new record underscores a remarkable revival in the City's fortunes. This year, as a result of rising equity markets and turbulent foreign exchange markets, London's trading houses have enjoyed record profits. This month BZW, the broking and investment arm of Barclays Bank, announced half-year profits almost doubled at Pounds 234m. Union Bank of Switzerland, which owns the leading London stockbrokers UBS Phillips and Drew, reported that half-year profits from trading were up 144 per cent at SFr1.55bn (Pounds 700m). 'I think there is a mood change in the City,' said one market strategist. But relief is mixed with sobriety. There is little suggestion that London's dealers are about to resume the spending spree on which many embarked in the mid-1980s. Porsche's largest UK distributor, in Chiswick, west London, might be recording a five-fold increase in car sales this August over last, but there is a much more cautious mood. The management of the Altruist champagne bar in the City's Bow Lane said that this August had been better than last, but attributed this mainly to the weather. Nearby at the Bow Lane Colony Wine bar, manager Gill Owen said there was less talk of recession, but people were still ordering house wine at parties instead of champagne. 'It used to be that as long as it was cold and fizzy people would drink champagne by the case,' she said. The more sombre mood is blamed on the fear of unemployment. Stockbrokers said there had been redundancies in their industry as recently as three months ago. Last month the Institute of Management and Research, the body representing Britain's 3,100 investment analysts, said it would defer its Pounds 81 annual subscription fee for unemployed members. There is little evidence so far that employment in the City is recovering. Mr Peter Rees, City planning officer at the Corporation of London, estimated that five years ago some 320,000 people worked in the financial district. Now, he said, the figure was approaching 250,000. The recession and the introduction of new technologies were to blame. Personnel executives at City broking houses reported a slight increase in movement of staff between firms. However, most institutions are expected to be cautious about repeating their mistake of the 1980s in increasing overheads that could prove difficult to sustain. 'Institutions will be a lot more wary about handing out ridiculous sums of money,' a personnel manager said.

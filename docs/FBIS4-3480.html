			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] Danzim, deputy secretary of the Tibet Autonomous  Regional CPC Committee, pointed out at the ongoing autonomous  regional propaganda and ideological work meeting: News media in  Tibet should actively adapt themselves to meeting the needs of  establishing a socialist market economic structure and do a good  job in news propaganda and guiding public opinion. It is  necessary to adhere to the principle of promoting unity,  stability, vigor, and positive publicity; put the stress of news  propaganda on economic construction, reform, and opening up;  serve the central task--economic construction--in a more  conscientious and effective way; and take a clear-cut stand in  supporting and publicizing reforms.    Comrade Danzim said: All news media should devote their  major energy to reporting Tibet's great undertakings of reform  and opening up, the people's pioneering spirit during the course  of creating a new life, and the political stability, economic  prosperity, social progress, and happiness enjoyed by the  people. News articles, pictures, and photographs should be  aimed at reporting the cadres, workers, peasants, herdsmen, and  commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, public  security police, and armed police force who are working hard on  the forefront of economic construction, maintaining stability,  and building the two civilizations.    Comrade Danzim pointed out: News propaganda should be  designed to guide, protect, and bring into play the initiative  of the people and of all quarters; and to make people's thinking  and deeds conform to the party's basic line, and the general  guidelines and tasks assigned by the Party Central Committee and  autonomous regional party committee. News media should serve as  a center of public opinion for promoting reform, opening up,  economic development, and social stability in Tibet.    Comrade Danzim emphasized: Strengthening leadership over  news media is of extreme importance in providing correct  guidance for public opinion. The party committees and  propaganda departments at all levels in Tibet should establish  and improve the system of meeting the press. News media should  step up contacts with economic departments. Economic  departments should constantly keep the news media informed of  economic work so they can promptly and accurately know the  economic situation and report it accordingly.</p>

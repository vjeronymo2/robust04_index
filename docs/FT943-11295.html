			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / FT Ski Expedition: Welcome snow Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a round-the-world expedition. They are currently in South America. Heini Kempel was pleased to see the snow-laden clouds. The snow, he said, was desperately needed. The contrast between the rain-sodden Gran Catedral of the last few days and the same resort under snow was stark. Before the snow, the ski schools - five major ones and innumerable splinter groups - at South America's biggest and oldest ski area, near San Carlos de Bariloche, had been in disarray trying to cope with thousands of students on coach tours from Buenos Aires. The tira bolas, or snowball throwers, flock to Argentina's ski areas in the school holidays, and ride to the mountain-top to admire the view. 'Normally we persuade quite a few to try skiing while they're here, and many return the following year on a proper skiing holiday,' says Kempel, director of the Escuela Esqui Catedral, the main ski school at Gran Catedral. But the weather has been a big problem: 'We've been losing so much business,' he says. Heini, one of the Argentine demonstration team's crack skiers, is a real find. He leaps to his feet in restaurants and bars at the slightest query about technique and delivers an impassioned half-hour impromptu ski lesson. The Argentines have an impressive ski school programme, and he is not slow to criticise the Swiss and the French. This year we have skied with instructors from 11 countries, all with different ideas about technique. With 50 runs, 32 lifts and a vertical drop of 3,280ft, Bariloche is an excellent ski area. The planned new jumbo gondolas, the much bigger cable car (the present one holds only 25) and two high-speed quad chairs should substantially improve it. The resort's first cable car sank to the bottom of the Atlantic after a cargo ship from Italy was sunk at the start of the second world war. They had to wait 11 years for a replacement.</p>

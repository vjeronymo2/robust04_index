			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / International Company News: Mandarin Oriental slightly ahead MANDARIN Oriental, the Jardine Matheson group's Hong Kong-based luxury hotel company, yesterday announced a 2 per cent increase in profit attributable to shareholders of USDollars 19.5m for the six months ended June, up from USDollars 19.2m a year earlier. The results were below expectations, primarily due to the further decline in earnings from the 45 per cent owned Oriental hotel in Bangkok, and a weak performance from the group's hotel interests in Macau, where there has been a substantial increase in the supply of luxury hotel rooms over the past year. Group turnover increased 7.7 per cent to USDollars 78.1m at the interim stage, and operating profit recorded a 16 per cent increase, due to improved performances from the two wholly-owned properties in Hong Kong  - the Mandarin and the Excelsior - and from its hotel in Manila. Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, said: 'In the first half of the year, the group's strong performance in Hong Kong was largely offset by weakness in most of our other markets. If the same trend continues, the results for the full year are expected to remain little changed (from 1992).' The interim dividend is being held at USDollars 1.41 a share.</p>

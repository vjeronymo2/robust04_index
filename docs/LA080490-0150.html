			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NUTS &amp; BOLTS;  </P> <P> A HOW-TO FOR HOMEOWNERS;  </P> <P> 'SILK' PLANTS TAKING ROOT AS REALISTIC ALTERNATIVE  </P> <P> The Age of Aquarius turned me into a murderer.  </P> <P> While my increasingly mellow friends were turning their apartments into  one-bedroom jungles, hanging aggressively blooming plants everywhere there  wasn't furniture (which was precisely everywhere), I was killing everything  from Boston ferns to cacti.  </P> <P> I would buy plants guaranteed to survive a nuclear winter. After four days in  my care, they turned to parchment. I watered them, fed them, played Mozart to  them, threatened them. They all croaked. I had a cement thumb.  </P> <P> The solution was not plastic plants. In those days, an artificial fern looked  less like a green plant than an opponent for Godzilla. Besides, you'd get the  cold shoulder from the Earth Shoes crowd for being non-natural.  </P> <P> But today, people like me have to look at the bigger issue, which is whether to  enjoy the permanent beauty of the fake stuff and risk being unhip, or to enjoy  the brief beauty of real house plants before you suffer the guilt pangs of  knowing that you hastened their cruel deaths through sheer botanical  incompetence.  </P> <P> Fortunately, with today's ersatz house plants, you can avoid a good bit of the  indecision simply because they look so great. In some cases, in fact, they  almost look more real than the real thing.  </P> <P> And they almost make Cindy Boothe look like a gardener. Boothe doesn't deal in  fertilizer or water or potting soil or sunlight or shade. She doesn't tend  plants, she assembles them.  </P> <P> Boothe is the owner of A Silk Thumb, a small shop in Santa Ana dedicated to  silk plants and flowers. In her shop and others like it around the county, the  silk plants and flowers are all but undetectable as facsimiles from, say, four  feet away.  </P> <P> Are alarms going off? Are your natural budgetary defenses kicking in as you  start recalling how much you paid for that silk blouse or raw silk sport coat?  Relax. Silk in this case is mostly a generic term. Most "silk" plants and  flowers are actually made from polyester or cotton blends, Boothe says.  </P> <P> The growing popularity of silk plants, she says, has as much to do with the low  maintenance associated with them as with their realistic appearance. You simply  plunk them down on, say, a high shelf -- or in a windowless room where real  plants would die or on top of a piece of furniture that might suffer water  damage from an actual fern -- and forget them for a few weeks. And there they  stay, in perpetual full bloom.  </P> <P> When you think it's time to do a bit of dusting, you find a dry paintbrush,  gather up a handful of cloth leaves, and simply brush them off. If you have a  large artificial plant such as a ficus, you can take it out on the patio and  literally hose it down.  </P> <P> Most of the materials Boothe uses -- about 90%, she says -- come from the  Orient. There are some U.S. companies that produce silk plants, but these are  more expensive than their Asian counterparts. Some plants are made in Europe,  but these too tend to be costly. A single flower from Holland, for example, may  cost as much as $40, Boothe said.  </P> <P> Generally, though, the stuff isn't cheap anywhere. One of Boothe's large floral  arrangements is priced at $85, a good-size ficus goes for $180 and a fairly  full-looking philodendron runs about $50.  </P> <P> The main determinant of price, Boothe said, is how realistic the plant looks --  and therein lies a caveat emptor.  </P> <P> "There's a huge fluctuation in prices," Boothe said, "because in this business  the same word doesn't necessarily mean the same thing."  </P> <P> For example, she said, a silk ficus that goes for $40 at the local discount  store may look as if it had suffered through a hard winter, and it may have a  trunk that can quickly be spotted as fake. But a silk ficus on the market  elsewhere for $150, with a real (albeit dead) trunk is going to look like a  ficus, even up close.  </P> <P> To achieve that lifelike quality, manufacturers use a process in which the  cloth is printed in much the same way a T-shirt would be silk-screened. Leaves  or flowers with variegated colors require multiple pressings, and different  fabric blends and coatings are used to achieve various textures and finishes.  </P> <P> In addition, Boothe said, some manufacturers are now using a process that  involves imprinting an actual photographic image of a real leaf onto a cloth  one.  </P> <P> Unlike a real plant, a silk one can be made to your specifications. Want it to  look bushier? Boothe will drill a few more holes in the trunk and attach more  branches and leaves.  </P> <P> Yes, custom orders or no, real plants are cheaper. But you have to leave them  with the neighbors when you go on vacation, you have to water them and fuss  over them and -- heaven help us -- talk to them. If you're lucky, they'll live  and you'll get to feel like Luther Burbank.  </P> <P> But listen up, all you murderers, and remember this: You can't kill a polyester  fern. That ought to cheer you up if you have a bothersome conscience.  </P> <P>  Besides, think of the fun you'll have watching the cat try to decide whether  to eat it.  </P></p>

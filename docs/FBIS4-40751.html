			<p>BFN     [Text] There are no disagreements between the Russian  president and the chairman of government, Viktor Chernomyrdin  said today talking to journalists before leaving by air for  Italy.    The head of the Russian Government stressed that he has had  no disagreements with Boris Yeltsin from the start and he does  not have them now. Nevertheless, there are forces which would  like to create the impression of such disagreements, Viktor  Chernomyrdin said.    Among the government's priority tasks for the next month, he  mentioned the beginning of the second stage of privatization,  the curbing of inflation at the level of the last few months,  and the improvement of conditions for direct investments in the  Russian economy.

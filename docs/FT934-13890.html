			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Air France strike brings flight chaos STRIKING Air France workers yesterday brought chaos to the two main airports in Paris, blocking runways and forcing the cancellation of flights to and from the French capital. The protests are the most serious to be launched against the loss-making airline's recovery plan, which was announced last month and which involves the loss of 4,000 jobs by the end of next year and the implementation of economy measures. Both Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports were paralysed by the protests, which left hundreds of passengers stranded at airports and on board aircraft. Orly later re-opened. Air France said it was unclear what the situation would be today, but it seemed likely that flights serving destinations in Europe, Turkey and Israel would be cancelled. The airline said that between five and 10 long-haul flights were expected to operate from Charles de Gaulle airport tomorrow.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Federal Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications [BMPT] has concluded a memorandum of  understanding with the Ukrainian postal administration on aid  with legislation on the postal reform planned in the Ukraine.  Dr. Laufs handed and illustrated to the Ukrainian delegation a  paper on the assistance to be provided by the Federal Government  in an advisory capacity. He pronounced the BMPT willing to  tutor experts from the Ukraine in Germany. There is enormous  interest in the Ukraine in laying and operating optical fiber  lines for the trunk network, and a leasing model is being drawn  up with DBP [Deutsche Bundespost] Telekom to finance the  program. In parallel with the political talks, BMPT manager  Masson discussed the issue of radio frequencies with Ukrainian  specialists. Their talks covered openness in frequency  allocation, licensing, and approval matters, charges, monitoring  systems, and organizational and working procedures. Since its  separation from Moscow, the Ukraine has had neither specialists  nor data material at its disposal. Germany thus promised  support with the technical preparations for the forthcoming  world broadcasting conference.    The telecommunications sector in the Ukraine is much  courted,  and the United States, the Netherlands, and France are all  trying hard to get a foot in the door for their companies. DBP  Telekom, too, has permanent representatives in the Ukraine:  Telekom holds shares in mobile radio and the digital overlay  network, and has also trained 100 experts from the Ukraine.  Siemens maintains a joint venture engaged in manufacturing its  EWS [electronic switching system].</p>

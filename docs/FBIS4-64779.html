			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Peter Almond report: "Britain Will Help To Rebuild Forces"] </F>   [Text] British military trainers are due in South Africa  soon to help build the new multi-ethnic armed forces.    The trainers, led by a brigadier and including three RAF  [Royal Air Force] members, are part of an expected expansion of  Britain's military and commercial ties with South Africa.  British contractors are ready to strike deals in avionics,  shipbuilding and technical training.    British security interests are expected to increase  significantly throughout southern Africa; military trainers are  already working in several countries in the region and Mr  Mandela, the President-elect, has indicated that South Africa  might return to the Commonwealth.    South African and British officials regard the appointment  of  Mr Joe Modise as South African Defence Minister as indicating  that Mr Mandela intends to maintain a strong defence force which  could help the United Nations throughout southern Africa.    South African officials suggest the renewal of military  links  with Britain would be at the expense of Pretoria's ties with  Israel, which has helped maintain South Africa's high-technology  weapons industries.    South Africa is making a determined effort to sell Britain  its new Rooivalk attack helicopter. The Ministry of Defence has  allowed the Rooivalk to be officially entered as another serious  contender, along with American and European firms, for a 1  billion pound contract for up to 91 helicopters.    It will be demonstrated in Britain for the first time this  week at the Army Air Corps air show at Middle Wallop, Hants.</p>

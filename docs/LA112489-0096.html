			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RYE EXPLANATION FOR PAST CRAZINESS;  </P> <P> HISTORY: WITCH TRIALS, PLAGUES, SOCIETAL PANICS HAD THEIR ORIGINS IN  CONTAMINATED FOOD, SAYS A HISTORIAN.  </P> <P> For three strange weeks 200 years ago this past summer, France's countryside  was gripped by an inexplicable terror.  </P> <P> Rumors swept through towns and villages that bandits were about to seize the  year's grain harvest. Peasants, weeping and shouting, took to the woods with  pitchforks and muskets. Others crisscrossed the countryside in a blind panic,  looting and burning chateaux and so terrifying the French aristocracy that they  took steps to abolish what was left of the ancien regime, France's  pre-revolution social order.  </P> <P> La Grande Peur of 1789 is considered a pivotal event in the history of the  French Revolution.  </P> <P> But, like so many of the outbreaks of panic and bizarre behavior of medieval  and early modern Europe, how and why it happened remain a puzzle to historians.  </P> <P> Why, for example, did it occur in some parts of France but not in others? Why  did the hysteria appear to affect entire communities simultaneously instead of  spreading from house to house and town to town as panic ordinarily would? And  what possible explanation, psychological or otherwise, could there be for  spontaneous mass psychosis?  </P> <P> According to a study by Mary Kilbourne Matossian, a University of Maryland  historian, the mystery of La Grande Peur can be explained by the rye bread that  was the bulk of the diet of French peasants of the period.  </P> <P> Drawing on historical records, Matossian argues that the French countryside was  in the grip of a massive outbreak of food poisoning brought on by a fungus that  grows on rye grain and that produces a natural form of the hallucinogen LSD.  </P> <P> Matossian's arguments appear in her recently published book, "Poisons of the  Past: Molds, Epidemics, and History," a sweeping reinterpretation of European  and American history in light of what people ate.  </P> <P> In everything from the Black Plague of the 14th Century, to the witch trials of  Salem, Mass., the religious revivals of the 18th Century and the population  explosion of the early industrial revolution, Matossian maintains that serious  outbreaks of microbiological contamination of the food supply played a large  role in shaping social behavior and population patterns.  </P> <P> "Some of her conclusions may be exaggerated," said William McNeill, a  University of Chicago history professor. "It is almost always the case that  when you find something new and write about it, the result is a rather lopsided  picture. But she is on to a very significant point. This is something  historians simply haven't thought of."  </P> <P> Matossian's focus is on a fungus known as ergot, a highly toxic mold that under  certain climatic conditions -- cold winters and wet, warm summers, in  particular -- can grow and infect rye.  </P> <P> Ergot is the fungus from which LSD was originally extracted.  </P> <P> When consumed, even in minute quantities in flour made from infected rye, ergot  can cause an astonishing range of symptoms -- including gangrene, fertility  suppression, loss of motor control and severe hallucinations, delusions and  even death.  </P> <P> Ergot poisoning was a risk in pre-modern Europe, because, until the potato  became the dietary staple of the lower classes in the late 18th and early 19th  centuries, peasants north of the Alps and Pyrenees and those in Russia were  heavily dependent on rye, a hardy crop that can grow in extreme climates and  poor soils.  </P> <P> By some estimates, peasants in the region ate as much as two to three pounds of  rye bread a day, making them particularly susceptible to ergot poisoning when  conditions favored its development.  </P> <P> Matossian's approach is to try to account for outbreaks of bizarre behavior in  a given area by looking at local food consumption patterns and climatic  conditions over the previous growing season.  </P> <P> In 1789, for example, the year of La Grand Peur, "France had not seen weather  conditions so favorable to the growth of ergot on rye . . . since 1697, when  reasonably complete records were first kept," she writes.  </P> <P> First, an unusually cold winter weakened the rye, which is planted in the fall  for harvest the following spring. A cold and humid spring then allowed the  fungus to grow on the plants; a warm dry May promoted the spread of fungal  spores; the warm, wet summer that followed was ideal for the formation of toxic  alkaloids.  </P> <P> Matossian uses the same analysis to explain the peculiar phenomenon of witch  trials, which periodically gripped different parts of Europe in the Middle  Ages.  </P> <P> The symptoms normally associated with bewitchment, she says, are strikingly  similar to the central nervous system disorders caused by ergotism: tremors,  parasthesias (sensations of pricking, biting ants crawling on the skin),  spasms, seizures, contractions of the face and eyes, hallucinations and panic  attacks.  </P> <P> The parts of Europe where witch trials were most common were cold and wet areas  where rye was the staple. By contrast, in Ireland -- where the peasant diet  consisted mainly of dairy products and oats -- witch trials were rare.  </P> <P> Matossian is not the first to link witch persecution with food poisoning. At  least one other researcher has suggested that ergotism played a role in the  Salem witch trials of Colonial Massachusetts, a conclusion Matossian supports  with evidence of an unusual amount of rye eating in Salem at the time of the  outbreak and ideal climatic conditions in the previous year for ergot growth.  </P> <P> Matossian's most original work concerns the historical debate about the causes  of the European population explosion of the mid-18th Century.  </P> <P> Some historians have proposed "the potato theory" of population growth, arguing  that the introduction of the potato into the diet of northwestern Europe in the  early 1800s so improved agricultural production that it was possible to sustain  a larger population.  </P> <P> To the potato theory, which has been attacked as an insufficient explanation  for the dramatic population gains between 1750 and 1850, which in England and  Wales averaged some 300%, Matossian adds a critical addendum: Perhaps, she  says, the switch from cereals to potatoes helped population growth by  eliminating a source of ergot toxins, which suppressed fertility and increased  mortality.  </P> <P> In Russia, where dietary changes happened much later than in Western Europe,  Matossian cites statistics that show that as the consumption of rye dropped  from 40.8% of total starches to 20.6% between 1885 and 1926 -- and potatoes  grew from 17.5% to 37.4% in the same period -- infant mortality dropped from  274 per thousand births to 172 and the death rate dropped from 34 per thousand  to 19 per thousand.  </P> <P> Matossian's evidence, throughout her book, is not proof. It is based on  correlations, which are notorious for their potential to mislead.  </P> <P> "I have written this book with a keen sense of limitation," she said.  </P> <P> "There is a great deal of this kind of (correlative) hypothesis behind some of  her assertions, and in that sense she is on treacherous ground," McNeill said.  </P></p>

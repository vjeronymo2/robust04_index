			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: State promotes highway bonds THE MEXICAN government's plan to finance new highways through the sale of toll concessions is creating the country's first revenue bond market, Bloomberg reports from Mexico City. International investors may find the new securities - bonds backed by the revenue generated by toll roads - attractive, said Mr Javier Magana, a director of Probursa, a Mexican brokerage. 'If there's a growth area in Mexico it will be infrastructure,' Mr Magana said. 'It could be an interesting way for foreign investors to diversify their Mexican holdings.' Mexico, which had 2,500km of roads when President Salinas took office in 1989, has said it hopes to build another 3,500km for Dollars 10bn during the president's six-year term. The government wants to finance road construction by awarding toll concessions to private companies, or by selling existing roads and using the revenues to construct new highways in less-developed areas of the country. Yields on the highway bonds can be attractive. The eight-year bonds for the Manzanillo-Armeria highway that mature in November 1999, guarantee investors 20 per cent or 300 basis points over the highest yielding short-term Treasury bill, currently 14.1 per cent, whichever is greater.</p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent depressed by Japanese weakness EVENTS in the Far East echoed gently, but still depressingly among most continental bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS drifted to the day's low shortly after the start and stayed there for most of the day. The CAC-40 index hit 1,922.22 before closing at 1,929.22, down 17.83. Dealers reported several basket trades and blamed the bigger price movements on the low turnover, estimated at FFr1.7bn-1.8bn. Lafarge was one of the day's most active stocks, falling FFr8 to FFr337 with 300,600 shares traded on 1991 profits below market expectations of FFr1.3bn. Some brokers are likely to revise down their 1992 profit estimates as a result. News that a Paris court had cancelled the sale of a 13.82 per cent stake in Perrier to Groupe Saint-Louis prompted Perrier to jump FFr14 to FFr1,650 while Saint-Louis dropped FFr43 or 3.1 per cent to FFr1,341. Dealers said the ruling improved Nestle's chances of success in taking over the mineral water company, and at the same time, raised the likelihood that it would only have to increase its offer price of FFr1,475 by a nominal amount. Total fell FFr6.80 or 2.9 per cent to FFr232.10 as relatively heavy selling by a UK broker hit a thin market. FRANKFURT traded in a thin range as the FAZ index fell 3.12 to 700.70 at midsession, and the DAX closed 7.84 lower at 1724.80. Turnover fell from DM4.7bn to DM3.8bn. The market was hurt by a report that Volkswagen's margins on car production were very adversely affected last year by start-up costs for the new Golf model. VW itself fell DM4.60 to DM366.40. But this may also have reflected profit-taking: after a weak 1991, the shares had led the German market up this year with a rise of 31 per cent to a 1992 peak of DM378.50. The multiple expiry of March DAX index contract, options on the DAX future, options on the DAX itself and stock options on Friday was expected to bring some volatility into the market later this week. MILAN closed weaker on the final day of the February account and there were reports that rather than covering short positions, professionals were borrowing stock from banks in order to carry them over. The Comit index fell 5.44 to 505.27 in turnover estimated at around Friday's 96.9bn. Fiat eased L15 to L4,870 at the official fixing but was quoted as low as L4,770 in afternoon trading in London on the Paris news about Perrier. This move was seen as lessening the Agnelli group's chances of taking over the French mineral water company. The banking sector lost 1.7 per cent, and there were further signs that the San Paolo share offering had not gone smoothly. The shares are due to start trading today. There was a grey market offer price of L12,300, just above the issue price of L12,200, but no grey market bid price. Mediobanca fell L350 to L13,820. Pirelli was one of the few gainers, adding L5 to L1,185 on short-covering. ZURICH ended above its lows on bargain hunting in moderate volume, the SPI index easing 3.9 to 1,121.0. Bearers in the restaurant and hotel group, Movenpick, rose SFr150 or 4.1 per cent to SFr3,850. After the bourse the company said that its chief executive officer, Mr Michel Favre, had stepped down with immediate effect. AMSTERDAM drifted lower and the CBS Tendency Index closed down 0.5 at 124.7. Wolters Kluwer, the publishing group, reported a 24 per cent increase in net profits, below market expectations, and shed 70 cents to Fl 68.80. Hunter Douglas, the building materials group, which reported disappointing results on Friday, rose 80 cents to Fl 64.00 on bargain-hunting, while Ahold, the retailer, closed down 40 cents at Fl 85.60 as investors took profits. News that an Italian engineering group had taken a 6 per cent stake in Fokker left the aircraft manufacturer 30 cents lower at Fl 34.70. MADRID was quiet in low turnover: the general index closed down 1.31 at 258.87. The construction sector, which had performed strongly at the end of last week, fell back as investors took profits. BRUSSELS ended mixed with the Bel-20 index closing down 3.64 at 1,208.76 in turnover of BFr558m. Petrofina shed BFr50 to BFr10,500 while Solvay fell BFr75 to BFr12,425. STOCKHOLM was supported by Ericsson, which saw its B shares up SKr5 to SKr131 and accounted for more than a quarter of overall volume, moderate at SKr391m. Ericsson had already risen on big orders in Malaysia and Germany; yesterday there were rumours of even bigger orders yet to come in Iran and Japan, and a story that General Electric was eyeing a stake in the telecommunications group. The Affarsvarlden General index rose 2.1 to 988.6. Modo B closed only SK1 lower at SKr227 on an 82 per cent fall in 1991 profits, better than its own forecast of break-even. COPENHAGEN fell across a broad front, with the CSE index closing 2.89 lower at 340.12. Danske Bank, Novo Nordisk and East Asiatic were among the most active losers, falling DKr6 to DKr311, DKr6 to DKr523 and DKr4 to DKr141. HELSINKI fell back slightly, the HEX index shedding 2.8 to 860.0 in turnover of FM13.2m.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - MAR 16  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes Open     10 am    11 am   12 pm   1 pm     2 pm    3 pm     close 1146.59  1146.89  1147.85 1146.90 1146.99  1146.78 1145.97  1145.61  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Day's High  1147.94    Day's Low  1145.40  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mar 13    Mar 12   Mar 11    Mar 10    Mar 9 1154.40   1149.99  1161.88   1169.22   1165.45  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

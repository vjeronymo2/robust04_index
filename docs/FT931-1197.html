			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar/D-Mark checks decline THE DOLLAR perked up against the D-Mark yesterday, rising more than a pfennig in late European trading, as dealers kept their attention fixed on the fluid political situation in Russia, writes James Blitz. For most of this week, the D-Mark had been pushing the dollar downwards, with the US currency trading on Wednesday below DM1.63. Some dealers have even wondered whether a break below DM1.60 was possible this week. But the dollar managed to check the trend yesterday, closing in London at DM1.6420, up nearly 1 1/2 pfennigs on the day. The dollar's rise may have been partly due to signs that the political crisis in Moscow was easing off. This may seem an ironic claim, because the US currency has tended to perform well at times of international crisis when it is seen as a safe haven for investors. However, although the D-Mark has itself come under some pressure in Europe because of events in the former Soviet Union, the dollar/D-Mark rate has slid this week. One factor weighing the US currency down may be fears that political instability in Russia would threaten President Bill Clinton's peace dividend and his attempts to reduce the US budget deficit. Yesterday's decision by Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the speaker of the Russian parliament, not to seek the impeachment of President Yeltsin, may therefore have boosted the US currency. Profit-taking following the dollar's fall may also have been a factor helping the dollar up. Another cause for the D-Mark to weaken yesterday was the Bundesbank's decision to cut the interest rate on its 3-day Treasury bill by 90 basis points to 7.5 per cent. Some dealers described the move as a significant easing of Bundesbank policy because the Treasury bill rate is sometimes seen as marking the effective floor for all German cash market rates. The move underpinned the French franc against the D-Mark inside the European exchange rate mechanism. The French currency closed at FFr3.3990 from a previous FFr3.401. Sterling also performed more strongly, closing up  1/2 a pfennig at DM2.4200. Despite the Treasury bill move, the Portuguese escudo slipped sharply against the D-Mark yesterday, prompting currency intervention from the Bank of Portugal. A recent disagreement between the Portuguese central bank and the finance ministry over economic policy continued to hang over the currency. The escudo closed at Es92.72 from a previous Es92.93 on Wednesday night. Another currency to remain weak against the D-Mark was the Italian lira, which closed in London barely changed on the day at L976.4. One analyst said that rumours in the market that Moody's rating agency was about to downgrade Italy's sovereign debt was a factor keeping the lira weak.</p>

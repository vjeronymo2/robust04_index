Rakowski in the case relating to the illegal  turnover of hard currency in 1990 between the former CPSU and  the former PZPR [Polish United Workers Party] has been directed  to the Regional Court for Warsaw by the capital Prosecutor's  Office, its head, Prosecutor Jerzy Labuda, has reported.    The Prosecutor's Office accuses Rakowski of having in  January  1990 received from the then CPSU Central Committee a loan of  $1.2 million and 500 million zloties without the required hard  currency permit, which broke the Treasury Penal Law. This was  to have been financial aid for the PZPR prior to its final  congress.    On 8 December, the Prosecutor's Office discontinued  proceedings against Leszek Miller in the face of a lack of  evidence of his having committed a crime. He had been accused  of having repaid $600,000 of this loan in November 1990,  transgressing the law. In accordance with the regulations in  force in 1990, the actions of which Rakowski is accused carried  the penalty of a fine of up to 2 million zloties.    The capital Prosecutor's Office commenced an investigation  in  November 1991 on the basis of materials gathered by the State  Protection Office. It had been waiting for many months for a  reply from the Russian prosecutor's office, which it had  addressed with a request for legal assistance and the  questioning of USSR former Vice President Yanayev and a number  of employees of the former CPSU Central Committee.    In the middle of October this year, Prosecutor Janusz  Regulski, who was then leading the investigation, decided to  discontinue it, inter alia in the face of the low credibility of  the testimony of the two Russians involved in the financing by  the former CPSU of other communist parties.    The implementation of this decision was suspended though; in  the view of the heads of the capital prosecutor's office,  Regulski inter alia deemed the action of which Rakowski is  accused an action "of low degree of social threat," whereas the  amount of money at hand was the not at all modest sum of over a  million U.S. dollars.</p>

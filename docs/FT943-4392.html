			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Rift at the top of Fed is denied Mr Alan Blinder, the vice-chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, yesterday denied any rift between himself and Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, over the need to control inflation, but insisted that central banks also needed to pay attention to unemployment. Mr Blinder repeated his belief that unemployment should play a role in setting monetary policy, a view which sparked a flurry of concern that he was 'soft on inflation' when he expressed it two weeks ago at a Federal Reserve conference held in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. 'To my mind, the controversial position that I staked out in Jackson Hole amounted to endorsing the Federal Reserve Act,' he told a meeting of the Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington yesterday, pointing out that the statute establishing the Fed directed it to pursue both maximum employment and stable prices. But Mr Blinder insisted that Mr Greenspan and he were at one in believing that monetary policy could only have an effect on unemployment in the short run, but that in the long run there was no trade-off between unemployment and inflation. 'If there's any difference it's usually that when the chairman says that he is emphasising the fact that there isn't any long run trade-off, despite the fact that the economy fluctuates in the short run, and I certainly agree with that. . . I emphasised instead that there is in fact a short-run trade-off, despite the fact that there is no long-run trade-off,' Mr Blinder said. 'So this is exactly a case of whether you look at this glass and find it half full or half empty,' he said, adding that he did not believe there were any 'current operational differences of any significance' between him and the rest of the Fed board. Nevertheless, financial markets and some commentators had seen a possible future policy disagreement in Mr Blinder's apparent refusal to give absolute primacy to the fight against inflation, as most central bankers around the world do. Mr Blinder said yesterday that 'the inflation objective has to, by default if nothing else, take primacy', because that was all that a central bank could control in the long run. However, he softened slightly his criticism of European central banks, which he had accused in Jackson Hole of being 'quite far from on target' in their policies. Yesterday, he said that 'almost everybody on the planet, I think, believes that European unemployment rates now are too high', and that many economists believed the rate could be reduced by perhaps 2 to 3 percentage points through an expansion of aggregate demand. But whereas in Jackson Hole he had focused his comments on central banks, yesterday he said that he meant macroeconomic policy in general, including fiscal policy.</p>

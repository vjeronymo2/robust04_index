			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 29 (AFP) -- Science and technology in  Russia are going through a transition period and are among the  first victims of the transformation and reform process there,  according to a report just published by the OECD.    Under the Soviet system, Russia was as advanced in these  fields as members of the Paris-based Organisation for Economic  Cooperation and Development, which groups together the world's  24 most developed countries. Now, it faces structural changes  likely to retain only those aspects of science which can help  the country's renewal, says the report, based on studies carried  out in the second half of 1993.    Under the communists' centralised system the sector had  developed out of all proportion to the country's Gross National  Product, and spending on military applications must now be cut  to allow civilian development, it said. Current priorities are  modernisation of the health and social security system, energy,  telecommunications and pollution.    Russian science, once cut off from the international  community, can now benefit from the new contacts and  collaboration with other countries, despite fears about a "brain  drain," it comments.</p>

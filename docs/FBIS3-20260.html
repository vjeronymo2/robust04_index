			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Tansu Ciller, True Path Party [TPP] leader and  prime minister, has said that in the elections, the nation  expressed its trust and love for the TPP once again, and that  the TPP is still in its heart.    Ciller described the local elections as a victory for the  TPP. She stressed that the people indicated that they want the  rightist parties to unite and also showed under which party they  want these parties to unite.    Addressing a TPP Assembly group meeting, Ciller pointed out  that contrary to expectations, the elections were held in a  peaceful atmosphere and that the people protected their  democracy once again. She said that this made her very happy,  adding that she is proud to be fulfilling the promises she made  to the nation. Another important result of the elections, she  said, is the fact that the TPP emerged as the party in the  nation's heart.    [Begin Ciller recording] There is another message the people  gave us through these elections. We must open are ears wide to  hear this message well. The message says that the rightist  parties must unite. [applause] The people have also indicated  under what party they want these parties to unite. We must heed  the strong voice of the people. Our people have also made it  clear that they do not want certain things. They do not want  injustice. They do not want lack of solutions, they took a  stand against the opposition because it does not offer any  solutions. Nor do our people want us -- who have been in power  only for seven to eight months -- to pay for the bill of the  economic problems that have been going on for the past 10 years.  [end recording]    Prime Minister Ciller stressed that the elections showed  that  the TPP which is the guarantee of stability, tranquillity,  unity, and faith, is the leading rightist party. She added that  this unity will add great strength to the country in solving the  existing problems. She said: The mission which the TPP will  follow from now on will make it come to power on its own.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, June 20 (BTA) -- Bulgaria's permanent  representative at the United Nations Valentin Dobrev briefed  international mediators on former Yugoslavia Lord David Owen and  Thorvald Stoltenberg on Bulgaria's position on the forthcoming  census in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  -- FYROM]. Bulgaria's representatives at the Council of Europe  in Strasbourg and at the United Nations and other international  organizations in Vienna provided similar information to the  Council of Europe and the Conference on Security and Cooperation  in Europe (CSCE).    The major points of the Bulgarian position, as reported by a  Foreign Ministry spokesman, are the following:    At this stage European standards applied by the Council of  Europe, the CSCE and other international institutions,  especially concerning the free expression of national identity,  are much higher than those operative in Macedonia likely to be  applied at census; the Government of Macedonia should take the  necessary steps to secure free expression for all its citizens,  in line with European standards; Bulgaria will take a stand on  the results accordingly; Bulgaria attaches great importance to  relations with Macedonia and is willing to promote them further.</p>

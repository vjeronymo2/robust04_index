			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RADON LEVELS IN 2 WELLS NOT 'ASTOUNDING'  </P> <P> Radon, a colorless, odorless gas considered to be the second-greatest cause of  lung cancer, has been found at two ground-water wells in San Diego County, but  the levels are not "astounding," a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  official said.  </P> <P> The naturally occurring gas is released when uranium ore in the ground decays.  When the ore is below a water table, the gas percolates through rock and  dissolves in the water, then escapes when a faucet is opened. If a home is  airtight, the gas accumulates, and particles of radon can become lodged in the  lungs.  </P> <P> It is prolonged exposure to radon that causes lung cancer, said Greg Helmes, an  environmental specialist for the EPA.  </P> <P> In a six-month study, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California  tested 200 wells in Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Ventura, Orange and San Diego  counties. Although the district supplies only surface water to its member  agencies, the study was done on their behalf, said Jennifer Smith, a  spokeswoman for the district. There are about 60 wells within the district's  boundaries in San Diego County, she said, adding that most of the water drawn  from the wells is used for irrigation.  </P> <P> Maximum contamination levels have not been set by the EPA, but they are  expected to be by the end of this year or early next year, Helmes said.  </P> <P> He said the maximum level of radiation could be set as low as 200 picocuries  per liter, or as high as 2,000 picocuries. (Radiation is measured in curies, or  the amount of material undergoing radioactive decay in one second. A picocurie  is one-trillionth of a curie.) One of the two wells tested is managed by the  city of San Diego and is near Lakeside between the El Cajon and El Monte-Santee  basins. It averaged 215 picocuries per liter. The other is in the Helix water  district near the San Pasqual Basin in northeastern San Diego County and  averaged 298 picocuries per liter.  </P> <P> The risk of getting lung cancer after a lifetime of exposure at levels between  200 and 500 picocuries per liter is one in 10,000, Helmes said.  </P> <P> The levels found in San Diego County are "not astounding. I mean, it's not  something to make you run out of the house or anything," he said.  </P> <P> Radon ranks second only to smoking as a cause of lung cancer. It largely  dissipates when it comes in contact with air.  </P></p>

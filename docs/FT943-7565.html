			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / CDU threatens to penalise unemployed who refuse to accept 'reasonable' jobs Days before the formal launch of its election manifesto, Germany's governing Christian Democrat Union (CDU) yesterday said it would reduce social assistance for people who refused to accept 'reasonable' jobs, writes Michael Lindemann in Bonn. The warning is part of a series of government measures designed to reduce unemployment, a struggle in which both the CDU and the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) want to demonstrate their credentials in the campaign. Mr Peter Hintze, CDU general secretary, said social assistance (the basic category of benefit paid to the estimated 900,000 long-term unemployed) would be reduced if jobs were rejected. The CDU was still debating the details of the proposal, he said. The employment initiative is one of a few morsels which have dropped from the table at which the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, are putting the final touches to their 65-page election manifesto which is to be launched on Thursday. Mr Hintze said the manifesto's top priority would be to create jobs. A drive to shore up family values and the fight against crime were other important features. Both the CDU and the SPD have made the fight against rising unemployment the mainstay of their campaigns. Although the economy is set to grow by 2.5 per cent this year the number out of jobs is set to remain at around 3.7m, close to a post-war high. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government has announced several initiatives this year including incentives for the civil service to provide more part-time jobs and permission for private employment agencies to compete alongside state-owned bodies in the labour market. In an effort to make further savings in next year's budget the government is also debating whether to introduce a two-year limit on the payment of unemployment benefit.</p>

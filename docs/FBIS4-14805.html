			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with UN Secretary General Butrus </F> Butrus-Ghali and with Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev by "Itogi"  program announcer Yevgeniy Kiselev; in English with superimposed  Russian translation -- recorded]    [Text] [Kiselev] It is a well known fact that in its  aspiration to play a key role in resolving the Georgian-Abkhaz  conflict, Russia has long been exerting diplomatic efforts with  the aim of gaining the status of peacekeeping forces for the  Russian Federation troops in that region. Issues relating to  the peacekeeping operations, in which, on the one hand, Russia  and, on the other, the United Nations are involved, were the  main subject of the negotiations in Moscow between Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev and UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali.  Our interview with them focused on this very topic.    Mr. secretary general, as everyone knows, the UN  peacekeeping  forces must not include servicemen from countries which are in  one way or another involved in the conflict or whose territories  neighbor on the conflict. Russia would today wish, on the one  hand, to widen the UN participation in peacekeeping operations  in the post-Soviet space, but on the other hand, it does not  want to refuse to get involved itself in resolving conflicts  near its borders, nor, indeed, can it refuse to do so. A very  contradictory situation is thus created. Where do you see the  way out of this, if there is one?    [Butrus-Ghali] Of course there is a way out. Take former  Yugoslavia, for instance. The United Nations, the European  Community and, finally, NATO are all taking part in the efforts  to establish peace in this region. I see no obstacles to  Russian forces taking part in peacekeeping operations on the  territory of the former USSR under the Russian Federation flag.  But at the same time, independent peacekeeping operations would  be taking place there in close cooperation with Russia,  involving UN observers, for example. This sort of approach has  not been adopted previously.    Previously, for the United Nations, it was an indispensable  condition that the entire command of any peacekeeping operation  remain in UN hands. However, now we do not have enough forces  for everything. Only recently, the United Nations never had  more than two or three peacekeeping operations on the go at the  same time. Today 17 such operations are being condutcted around  the globe at the same time. The annual budget of the UN  peacekeeping forces was at one time $500-600 million, whereas  now it is up to $3.6 billion per year. In this situation, we  cannot do without additional assistance from the UN member  countries, and also from various regional organizations.    [Kiselev] Nevertheless, if I understood you correctly, you  rule out the possibility of Russian Federation troops operating  under the UN flag in the capacity of peacekeeping forces in the  Transcaucasus or in Tajikistan, for example.    [Butrus-Ghali] Yes, it is impossible because the United  Nations Organization can carry out a peacekeeping operation only  from the very start, the same way a surgeon will not agree to  operate on a patient starting mid-way. But if you have already  started an independent peace-making operation, the United  Nations Organization can give you assistance and work side by  side with you. There is another option which is to include  Russian troops in a broader international peacekeeping  contingent, under UN command, though.    [Kiselev] What countries can send their servicemen to  participate in such a contingent, for instance, in Georgia,  Abkhazia, or Tajikistan? Is it at all feasible to form such a  contingent?    [Butrus-Ghali] It is feasible if a relevant agreement is  attained and if the UN Security Council is convinced that this  is necessary, because all this has to be paid for but the  Security Council is not always willing to do this. Many of its  members are disappointed by the fact that not all recent UN  peacekeeping operations have been successful, such as Somalia  and former Yugoslavia. So I repeat, Security Council members  have yet to be convinced, talks with them are needed. At the  same time, there are conditions stipulating an international  nature of the peacekeeping contingent, that is, Russian  servicemen will account for no more than 20-30 percent of its  total number while the remaining 70 percent will be made up of  servicemen from five or six other countries. Only in this case  will the United Nations defray the cost of the operation and,  again, on the condition of retaining the political leadership of  the operation.    [Kiselev] So you discussed all the above with our Foreign  Minister Kozyrev?    [Butrus-Ghali] Yes, we did.    [Kiselev] And what was the result: sharp disagreements or  mutual understanding?    [Butrus-Ghali] No, on the contrary, I hope that an accord  will be attained within the next few days, and on its basis we  will later discuss at the Security Council the issue of  dispatching UN peacekeeping forces or UN observers to the areas  of conflict in the former USSR.    [Kiselev] But you must agree that UN observers and  peacekeeping forces are not the same.    [Butrus-Ghali] You are right. However, if we do not get the  Security Council's consent to dispatching peacekeeping forces we  will still be able to obtain a mandate to dispatch observers.    [Interview cuts to Foreign Minister Kozyrev without  introduction or question from Kiselev]    [Kozyrev] Yes indeed, the role of observers is slightly  different. They are not troops. Therefore, they are taking  part. But this is useful. We would indeed like our contingent  to be granted the status of a UN contingent. Incidentally, this  option is being discussed. We are proposing this option for  Karabakh, and also for Abkhazia. But the problem once again is  this: if our contingent officially becomes a UN contingent, ie  if our servicemen literally don blue helmets, then the United  Nations has to pay for this in full. But unfortunately this is  what they do not want to do. Moreover, the United Nations has  to share with us political responsibility for these efforts.  Here again, as I have already mentioned, there is a budget  deficit, and there is also what I would call a deficit of  political courage and will. But the secretary general cannot  solve this question on his own. This question has to be solved  by the UN Security Council. Hence this question is not in the  hands of the secretary general, but in the hands of, above all,  permanent members and also other member states of the Security  Council.    Another aspect that we often forget is that the United  Nations operates on precedents. If the United Nations directly  agrees to involvement by a neighboring state in some conflicts  directly on its behalf -- I mean on behalf of the United Nations  -- one can imagine that in other conflicts, in other regions,  some other states would demand a similar mandate from the United  Nations. And here certain difficulties may arise. I will not  give any examples, but one can easily imagine this. Moreover,  it may well be that we ourselves will be very much concerned if  a particular neighboring state starts conducting operations in  its neighboring state under the UN flag, as it were.    [Butrus-Ghali] Security Council members' hesitations are not  just about you -- though I know that people in Russia do think  that the United Nations does not want to embark on peacekeeping  operations particularly in your case, on the territory of the  former [Soviet] Union. But this is not so. For example, we  would undoubtedly like to send 600 blue helmets to Mozambique.  We have been discussing it for six months, but not one of UN  member states shows any willingness to designate its servicemen  to be part of this contingent. So I have to go to various  capitals as a petitioner: please do send you soldiers to  Mozambique. But after all, UN members have to bear  responsibility to each other. Suppose tomorrow the United  Nations asks Russia to send 2,000 Russian servicemen to Angola.  Public opinion in your country will certainly start buzzing:  why should we send 2,000 of our soldiers to Angola? Why Angola?  Where is this Angola anyway? Why should my son risk his life  in Angola? Preparing public opinion is a huge problem. Say, if  you want Argentina or Chile --two weeks ago there was  negotiation about the possibility of those two countries  allocating some of their servicemen to be sent to Tajikistan in  the future. So you have to be prepared, in turn, to send your  servicemen, say, to Angola, however unpopular this measure might  be. One of my tasks is precisely this. I am telling Russia: I  know that you have many internal problems at home, but don't  forget about the United Nations.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont still on war path MR Norman Lamont discomforted the prime minister and delighted the opposition benches yesterday by highlighting the success of the policies with which he was associated as chancellor. Mr Lamont cited 'the catalogue of good economic indicators' which was now being enthusiastically trumpeted by his former cabinet colleagues. With heavy irony Mr Lamont asked the prime minister to congratulate Mr Kenneth Clarke, his successor as chancellor 'on the rapid success of his policies'. Mr Major replied: 'I know the chancellor will be most grateful for your support of his policies'.</p>

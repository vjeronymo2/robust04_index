			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Bush notifies Congress on Nafta President George Bush yesterday officially notified the US Congress of his intention to sign a North American Free Trade Agreement on or after December 17, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington. Under US law, he must give Congress 90 calendar days notice of his intention to sign a trade pact. In this case, Congress will have adjourned by the end of the period. When it returns, it will have 90 legislative days in which to approve or turn down legislation which would implement the agreement. 'The choice before us is stark  - to retreat into protectionism or move forward to new horizons of challenge and opportunity in an expanding global economy,' said Mr Bush said in a statement accompanying the text.</p>

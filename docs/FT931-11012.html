			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Saving the Danish Bacon TENSIONS inside the European exchange rate mechanism eased considerably yesterday after the Bundesbank surprised foreign exchange dealers by cutting its officially posted interest rates, writes James Blitz. The cuts of 25 and 50 basis points in the Discount and Lombard rates pushed the Danish krone well within its ERM bands against the D-Mark, and triggered a sharp appreciation in the value of the French franc. But, the timing of the move, in a week which has seen acute ERM pressures, was hailed as another indication that the Bundesbank is determined not to see the ERM break up. Mr Avinash Persaud, a currency strategist at UBS Phillips and Drew in London, said: 'This move brings the ERM back from the brink. There will be no further devaluations in the exchange rate mechanism for the next 12 months.' Miss Alison Cottrell of Midland Global Markets, who predicted last Christmas that the Bundesbank would ease its official rates on February 4th, said that the move was a complete about turn for Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president. But she added: 'A  1/4 -point off the discount rate is not the end of the road. The Bundesbank is buying time until after the French elections.' She now expects another easing in policy in April. The Danish currency had been trading close to its ERM floor against the D-Mark of DKr3.9016 before the Bundesbank move, forcing the authorities in Copenhagen to raise a key lending rate by 200 basis points. By the close of trading yesterday, the currency was near to its central ERM parity. at DKr3.8392. The French franc also appreciated to a close of FFr3.3790 at the European close, more than a centime up on the day. One-month French francs traded at around 12 per cent last night, around 300 basis points below their peak on Monday. A particularly interesting sign of how much the tension eased was that the 5 hard core currencies of the system - the D-Mark, French franc and the Benelux currencies - were all trading within 1 per cent of each other in the ERM grid last night. A move to 1 per cent bands for the hard core has often been touted as a road to faster monetary union. The dollar rose to a new 1993 high of DM1.6670 against the D-Mark on prospects of a narrowing of the D-Mark/dollar interest rate differential. It later closed at DM1.6535, up 1 pfennig on the day. The immediate prospects for the dollar depend on today's non-farm payroll figure for January, a critical indicator. Sterling gained 3 pfennigs on yesterday's rate cut, closing at DM2.3900. But, ironically, a rescued ERM puts off all hopes of an aggressive easing of interest rate policy. A slow shaving of German rates in 1993 is probably the last thing sterling investors want.</p>

			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Construction Contracts: IFF Pounds 9m deal flavours Amec work AMEC DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT has won a Pounds 9m contract to design, engineer and construct a Pounds 9m aroma chemical plant for International Flavours and Fragrances, at its Haverhill site, Suffolk. The new plant, which will be constructed under a guaranteed maximum price contract will produce Galaxolide TM, a basic ingredient used in fragrances for quality perfumes, washing powders, soap, detergent and other consumer products. It will replace an existing Galaxolide manufacturing facility at Haverhill. The Amec/IFF design team has incorporated the latest process chemistry and engineering technology, including Batneec and IPC, to ensure that the new plant is more energy and water-efficient and produces less effluent. Construction starts September this year and is due for completion in August 1994. The new plant will be a significant expansion of IFF's aroma chemicals operation and is the American-owned company's largest investment outside the US. It is anticipated that 90 per cent of the output from the new plant will be used for export to continental Europe, the Far East and America. Amec is part of the international construction, engineering and development Amec group.</p>

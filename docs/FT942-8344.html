			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / International Bonds: Grand Metropolitan raises Dollars 400m in eurodollar debut Relief over the latest move by the US Federal Reserve Board appeared to be filtering through to the eurobond market yesterday as Dollars 1bn worth of eurodollar issues were launched. One of the first in the queue was Grand Metropolitan, the food and drink giant, which raised Dollars 400m through its first eurodollar issue. The five-year paper was priced to yield 53 basis points above the equivalent Treasury bond. Mr Nick Rose, GrandMet's group treasurer, was enthusiastic about the bond's reception. 'Its not that often that rates in Europe are as attractive as they are in the US,' he said, arguing that he was taking advantage of the low level of issuance in five-year maturities. He said the paper was issued in Europe principally to increase GrandMet's profile on the continent where its brand names such as Burger King and Smirnoff vodka were more familiar to investors than the name of the company. The bonds were aimed at retail investors and by the end of the day around two-thirds of the issue had been taken up. Proceeds of the deal will repay short-term commercial paper borrowings and have already been converted into floating-rate dollars. However, some syndicate managers said the deal was priced too competitively and take-up was relatively slow. They felt that the pricing should have been least 10 basis points wider and were sceptical about the amount alleged to have been taken up. One commented: 'We are in the most vicious bear market in years and sentiment is not going to change that quickly.' Joint lead manager Morgan Stanley agreed that sales by the co-managers had been 'spotty' but defended the pricing. 'Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have always been responsible for raising GrandMet's debt in the US. We understand the company's credit rating and this deal is actually cheaper than the equivalent US paper,' an official at Morgan Stanley said. The market's inability to absorb yesterday's flood of paper were also reflected by an issue from JFM of Japan, which raised Dollars 300m through an offering of 10-year paper priced to yield 33 basis points above 10-year Treasuries. The spread held but lead manager IBJ International was believed to have bought some of the issue back after syndicate broke. Elsewhere, the Kingdom of Sweden launched a Y80bn zero-coupon issue maturing in September 1999. The issue was targeted at the Japanese retail investors and was priced to yield between 30 and 35 basis points above an equivalent bank debenture currently traded in Japan.</p>

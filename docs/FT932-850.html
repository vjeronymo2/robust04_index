			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Changes urged over tied agents SIR BRYAN CARSBERG, the director-general of fair trading, yesterday called for a change in the way life insurance products are sold. The Office of Fair Trading has proposed to the Treasury a regime where commissions on the sale of life products would have to be disclosed. This follows scrutiny of the new rules made by the Securities and Investments Board after last year's Retail Regulation Review. Sir Bryan, presenting the OFT's annual report yesterday, said part of the problem faced by consumers in making wise choices among products and life companies was caused by the polarisation in the industry between tied agents and independent financial advisers. He said: 'At present, you either have to retail the product of one company which means you are a tied agent, or else if you deal in the products of many companies you are categorised as an independent adviser. It seems to me that is a restriction on the market place and it would be preferable to avoid it.' He suggested the creation of a category called multi-supplier retailers. They would be able sell the products of many companies without holding themselves out as providing independent financial advice. Sir Bryan said his first year at the OFT had been very active. Although merger activity remained low last year, with the OFT recommending referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission of just 125 mergers - 40 per cent of the 1988 figure  - the number of monopoly inquiries had increased. Relations with Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, had remained good even though he had sometimes gone against Sir Bryan's advice. Co-operation with Brussels was also working well.</p>

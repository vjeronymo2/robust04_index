Scope <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On the basis of the submitted Tier 1 and/or Tier 2 data, or any other available information, EPA will determine whether further testing and/or analysis for the subject fuel or fuel additive is needed under the provisions of Tier 3. Given the variety of evaluations included in Tiers 1 and 2 and the wide range of possible interrelated outcomes which could be obtained, EPA proposed to use its discretion in determining the need for Tier 3 testing on a case-by-case basis. Decisions on the need for follow-up testing within Tier 3 would depend on expert scientific judgment as to the availability of adequate data to enable a health risk evaluation and the need for more definitive information for developing regulatory decisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA requested comments on the proposed discretionary nature of Tier 3 determinations and on a possible alternative approach involving the establishment of ``automatic triggers'' for Tier 3 decisions, i.e., specific outcomes of Tiers 1 and 2 which would make Tier 3 testing mandatory. Responses included both support and opposition to the proposed Tier 3 discretionary approach. EPA evaluated all comments and determined that decisions on Tier 3 requirements should remain at the discretion of EPA. In order to accomplish the goals of the program, it is essential for EPA to be able to examine the Tier 1 and Tier 2 data prior to prescribing additional tests. The need for and content of Tier 3 testing will most often be dependent on the results of the earlier tiers. In these cases, decisions on Tier 3 can only be reasonably specified after EPA's review of the applicant's initial submittal. The purpose of Tier 3 is not to fill all data gaps, but to establish a program that provides the Administrator with the necessary and reasonable information to make regulatory decisions. Based on this rationale, EPA judges that it is neither practical nor desirable to specify criteria which will automatically force F/FA manufacturers to perform additional testing under Tier 3. Thus, EPA will use its discretion to determine Tier 3 requirements on a case-by-case basis, allowing EPA to target specific regulatory needs. Although EPA can use the Tier 3 data to support regulatory actions, referral to Tier 3 level is not mandatory before beginning actions under CAA section 211(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The need for Tier 3 testing and/or analysis will depend, in part, on whether Tier 1 and/or Tier 2 data provide sufficient toxicity and exposure information to determine the potential health risks associated with a particular fuel or fuel additive. The endpoints to be addressed and the nature of the studies to be performed under Tier 3 are to be determined on a case-by-case basis. Tier 3 studies will most often be required to further explicate the results of the tests/analyses performed under Tiers 1 and 2 or to address other areas of concern highlighted by the literature search. If additional toxicity testing is required under Tier 3, the test might entail whole emissions (as in Tier 2), or the testing of one or more individual emission species identified to be of particular concern. EPA could also use other information (available outside this program) to require testing under Tier 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the specific objectives and scope of Tier 3 testing will vary depending on the concerns identified in the earlier tiers or any other information available to EPA, examples of possible areas for further testing are: chronic/lifetime studies, chemical disposition/metabolism studies, exposure studies, dosimetry analyses, additional emission characterization/speciation, additional modeling analysis, environmental toxicity tests, testing using different emission generation procedures or emission control systems, or any other additional evaluation approach EPA deems necessary to assess the health and/or welfare effects of a particular fuel or fuel additive. The previous examples and the discussion below in no way limit the scope of Tier 3 or EPA's authority to require further testing under this program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's rule specifically includes under Tier 3 any health effects testing to be performed on aerosol additives (see Section X.C for details on the special provision for aerosol products). Due to the special nature and use of this type of product, EPA judges that any testing needs will require non-standard test procedures that can be better addressed under Tier 3. EPA will review the composition information and literature data on the specific aerosol product and will determine if health effects testing is needed on a case-by-case basis. For example, if available literature, submitted under Tier 1, indicates that a component of an aerosol product is highly toxic, and the product is widely produced, then Tier 3 testing on the aerosol product would likely be indicated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Modeling of potential exposures, atmospheric reactivity, and/or environmental fate/partitioning may also be required under Tier 3, as explained in Section III.C. For example, if a fuel or additive is widely distributed and Tier 2 data indicate serious concern for health effects, EPA might require more extensive exposure analysis and/or modeling under Tier 3 to better define potential risks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the grouping mechanism included in this rule allows F/FA manufacturers to submit Tier 1 and Tier 2 data on the representative of a designated group for purposes of registration, EPA retains the authority under Tier 3 to require testing on any member product of a group. Thus, when follow-up testing is required under Tier 3 authority, the specified test(s) could be required to be conducted on the selected representative or on any other member of an existing group. Testing on additional F/FA products could be required if EPA identifies a concern for any member of the group other than the group representative. For example, the testing representative for the M85 group (consisting of methanol formulations containing 50&hyph;95 percent methanol) is an M85 base fuel containing 85 percent methanol by volume. In the future, other methanol fuels could enter the market and be used extensively, triggering a concern for exposure and potential health risks. In this case, EPA could require Tier 3 testing for another methanol formulation within the M85 group. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

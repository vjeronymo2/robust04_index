			<p>BFN     [Text] "The meeting was positive. We will form a  government." This was said by Forza Italia leader Silvio  Berlusconi at the end of the much-awaited meeting between Forza  Italia and the Northern League. He is optimistic about how long  it will take, but said that they had not yet discussed "the  premiership or names of ministers." However, an agreement has  been reached to reduce the number of ministries and  undersecretaries.    The Northern League's Francesco Speroni pointed out that  "the  debate about the Constitution is continuing. We will meet again  after Easter. National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini can  relax -- we will speak to him too." Umberto Bossi's candidate  for the premiership, Roberto Maroni, reiterated that "federalism  remains the most important point," while the Northern League's  Gianfranco Fini played down Bossi's absence from the meeting.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 23 Apr (XINHUA) -- Qian Qichen, vice  premier of the PRC State Council and concurrently foreign  minister, on 23 April sent a message of condolences on former  U.S. President Richard Nixon's death. The text of the message  follows:    I was distressed to learn of Mr. Richard Nixon's passing  away, and would like to express my heartfelt condolences.    While he was alive, Mr. Nixon made major contributions to  reopening the door of Sino-U.S. relations, and devoted great  efforts to maintaining and developing Sino-U.S. relations. I am  deeply convinced that Sino-U.S. relations, for which Mr. Nixon  showed concern and in which he played a role during his life,  will surely be improved and strengthened further.    I would like to express my cordial solicitude for Mr.  Nixon's  family.</p>

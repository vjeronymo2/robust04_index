			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] According to a poll conducted by the  respected Taloustutkimus organization as summarized by Helsinki  HELSINGIN SANOMAT on 22 April on page 7, over half of the 500  voters contacted expressed satisfaction with the way President  Martti Ahtisaari had performed his job since being inaugurated  on 1 March. In telephone interviews of 500 voters, around 60  percent said they were satisfied, while only 12 percent said  they were dissatisfied. Around 20 percent had no opinion. The  margin of error with such a small sampling is approximately 5  percent.    By way of contrast, the paper cites a similar poll conducted  in 1982 by the newspaper KALEVA, which found that Mauno  Koivisto, Ahtisaari's predecessor, was much more popular after  serving the same period in office. At this stage in 1982, around  85 percent of voters said they were satisfied with Koivisto.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (8) Trade secrets or other confidential research, development, or commercial information the Air Force or DoD owns, whose premature release probably would affect the Air Force's or DoD's negotiating position or other commercial interests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) Computer software qualifying as a record under this part which is deliberative in nature, if its release would inhibit decisionmaking. In this case, closely examine the use of the software to ensure its deliberative nature. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) Planning, programming, and budget information involving defense planning and resource allocation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Exemption 6_Invasion of Personal Privacy. Personnel, medical, and similar personal information in other files whose release to the public clearly invades personal privacy. To decide whether to release personal information, balance the privacy interest against what its release would tell the public about how the Air Force functions or about the conduct of an Air Force functions or about the conduct of any Air force employee (the public interest). Withhold records only when the privacy interest exceeds the public interest. Do not use this exemption to protect a deceased person's privacy, but you may use it to protect the privacy of the deceased person's family in rare instances. Generally let a person (or their representative) see their own personnel, medical, or similar files and withhold information from the subject only using 5 U.S.C. 552a, The Privacy Act of 1974 (see part 806b of this chapter). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Withhold names and duty addresses of personnel serving overseas or in sensitive or routinely deployable units. Routinely deployable units normally leave their permanent home stations on a periodic or rotating basis for peacetime operations or for scheduled training exercises conducted outside the United States or U.S. territories on a routine basis. Units based in the United States for a long time, such as those in extensive training or maintenance activities, do not quality during that period. Units designated for deployment or contingency plans not yet executed and units that seldom leave the United States or U.S. territories (e.g., annually or semiannually) are not routinely deployable units. However, units alerted for deployment outside the United States or U.S. territories during actual execution of a contingency plan or in support of a crisis operation qualify. The way the Air Force deploys units makes it difficult to determine when a unit that has part of its personnel deployed becomes eligible for denial. The Air Force any consider a unit deployed on a routine basis or deployed fully overseas when 30 percent of its personnel has been either alerted or actually deployed. In this context, alerted means that a unit has received an official written warning of an impending operational mission outside the United States or U.S. territories. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Sensitive units are primarily involved in training for special activities or classified missions, including, for example, intelligence-gathering units that collect, handle, dispose of, or store classified information and materials, as well as units that train or advise foreign personnel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Each MAJCOM and FOA will establish a system and OPR(s) to identify units in their command qualifying for this exemption. Appropriate OPRs could include Directors of Operations, Plans, and Programs, and Personnel. The resulting list of nonreleasable units will be reviewed and updated in January and July and provided to the MAJCOM or FOA FOIA office. This listing will be in ASCII format on a 31/2 or 51/4 inch floppy disk (double sided, high density), which contains the unit's eight-position personnel accounting symbol (PAS) code, with 1 pas code per line (record) (8-byte record). The MAJCOM or FOA FOIA manager will forward an electronic copy of the list of nonreleasonable units to AFMPC/RMI to be included in the personnel data system. The MAJCOM and AFMPC FOIA offices will use it to determine releasable lists of names and duty addresses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Exemption 7_Investigative Records. Records or information gathered for law enforcement purposes but only when releasing these records would probably: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Interfere with enforcement proceedings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

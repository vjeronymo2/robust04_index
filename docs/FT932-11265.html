			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Fraud in the EC dissatisfaction with Maastricht, the war in former Yugoslavia, the recession  -many ordinary voters at present take an unfavourable view of the European Community. One issue with a direct impact on taxpayers' wallets exacerbates this poor image: widespread misappropriation of EC cash. The publicity given to EC fraud, above all connected with payments linked to the common agricultural policy (CAP), has three effects. It weakens support among national governments and electorates for necessary increases in the EC budget. It highlights how the elaborate CAP mechanism for doling out farm subsidies can provide lucrative rewards for swindlers. And it illustrates the Community's shortcomings in its struggle against fraudsters in particular, and cross-border crime in general. Here, the EC is a long way from adopting a supranational approach. Verifying that the sometimes absurdly complex system of agricultural hand-outs works properly is a matter for national authorities, operating often without real co-operation. Many professional criminals specialising in 'milking' CAP funds are, on the other hand, well-organised in efficient transnational networks. Limit abuse Possibilities for illegal diversion of EC money will exist as long as the Community keeps its agricultural prices above world market levels and compensates farmers who stockpile or export surpluses. Despite the successful aspects of last year's plan for a partial overhaul of the CAP, this is a state of affairs with which the EC will have to live for many years. However, abuse can be limited. In this regard, the Commission's annual fraud report, published last week, makes depressing reading. By definition, most fraud is unreported. For 1992, the Commission records that Ecu118m was purloined from CAP export refund and price support schemes, with a further Ecu152m lost through evasion of customs duties and farm levies. Cases cited range from the sidestepping of levies on olive oil to the filing of dishonest claims for export of cereals, milk products or livestock. The EC admits that these examples form the tip of a much larger iceberg. Further, even where wrongdoing is proven, less than 10 per cent of defrauded funds are recouped. Financial incentive One important problem is that national governments have no direct financial incentive to recover money filched from the Community. Controls are often lax. Convictions are hampered by the complexity of many of the fraud rings, and by differing national judicial procedures. Penalties are generally small. The Community plainly realises the seriousness of the threat. The EC this year is spending Ecu133m on combating fraud, against Ecu77m in 1992. Much of the increase is earmarked for improving CAP management and controls. Greater use is being made of computers, and the EC is resorting to satellite surveillance of fields to ensure that 'set-aside' schemes do not reap farmers illicit profits. Such measures can, at least, act as a powerful deterrent. But more must be done. The EC Court of Auditors, the Community's spending watchdog, has proposed setting up an independent EC anti-fraud unit to help tackle the problem. Such a unit, staffed by financial experts and customs officials, could operate at arm's length from the court and the Commission, under the supervision of the European parliament. Drawing on better controls on consignments on the EC's external borders, more rigorous financial checks, and pooled intelligence, the unit would have powers to investigate suspected fraud cases speedily. This would be a useful innovation, but not a panacea. Judicial authorities and member governments would still have the responsibility for following up the unit's work and mounting prosecutions. The Community, however, badly needs to regain the initiative. If the opportunities for pillaging funds become as deeply entrenched as the CAP itself, the EC will be in a sorry state.</p>

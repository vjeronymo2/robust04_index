			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / P&amp;O to shed 450 workers next year P&amp;O European Ferries, the largest UK ferry operator, yesterday announced plans to shed up to 450 jobs from its workforce of more than 6,000, Charles Batchelor writes. The cuts are a response to the prospect of competition from the Channel tunnel, due to open next year, and new technologies which have reduced the demand for staff on shore and at sea. P&amp;O said it expected to dispense with up to 250 jobs on its nine Dover-based ships and a further 200 shore-based positions at Dover. The company hopes to achieve the cuts by voluntary redundancies. P&amp;O said no cuts would occur before next year, but it could not guarantee there would be no further reductions. The cuts are expected to fall among ships crews, from officers to ratings and among reservations and port operations staff. On board ship new computerised radio equipment has meant vessels no longer need specialist radio officers.</p>

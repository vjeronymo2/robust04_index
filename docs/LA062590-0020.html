			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. GAMES;  </P> <P> NO. 1 LONG BEACH POLY SUBDUES VENICE, 64-52  </P> <P> The field of high school basketball teams narrowed considerably in the third  round of the 23rd L.A. Games Sunday at El Camino College.  </P> <P> In pairings that resemble an NCAA tournament, the competition began Saturday  with 128 boys' teams and 64 girls' teams, making this the largest event of its  kind in the nation.  </P> <P> By Sunday's end there were only 16 boys' teams and eight girls' teams to  advance to the fourth round next Saturday.  </P> <P> Long Beach Poly, the No. 1-seeded team in the tournament and this year's  Southern Section 5-AA champion, held on to beat Venice, 64-52. In the first  half, Poly dominated the court with its fast-break play and rebounding ability.  </P> <P> At one point, Venice made a 12-3 run on Poly in the second half. That brought  the Gondoliers to within eight points, but it was as close as they would get.  </P> <P> Poly's starters returned with two minutes to play, putting an end to the Venice  offensive.  </P> <P> "I thought they'd be better, that it would be a harder game for us," senior  Yakim Craddock said.  </P> <P> The 6-3 guard scored 29 points. Tyus Edney added 22 points and 10 assists.  </P> <P> Craddock will be leading the team next season as some of Poly's best players  have graduated, including Willie McGinest, who accepted a scholarship to play  football at USC.  </P> <P> "If I had the (ball) handling down, I think (recruiters) would be starting to  look at me a little more," Craddock said.  </P> <P> Said Coach Ron Palmer: "(Craddock) dominated the game for us.  </P> <P> "Most of the bench will be freshman and sophomores," the coach added. "I have  17 kids out here and some of them will play junior varsity, but I want to give  them as much playing experience as I can."  </P> <P> Palmer coached his team to victory in the 1979 games.  </P> <P> "I always come into these games with a little bit of guarded optimism because  the city teams play in a (20-game) spring league, giving them an advantage."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, eighth-seeded Reseda Cleveland advanced to the fourth round by  routing Hamilton, 62-40.  </P> <P> Cleveland's participation in the games came as a surprise after the resignation  of coach Marc Paez in early June.  </P> <P> Varsity assistant Bart Ostoco took over as interim coach for the games. Because  he has been the school's junior varsity coach, he knows the kids moving up to  the varsity level.  </P> <P> "Our strongest points are our intensity and concentration," Ostoco said.  </P> <P> Brandon Martin, a 6-3 1/2 shooting guard, scored 16 points, and 6-5 forward  Kayed Murray added 10 while playing an excellent defensive game.  </P> <P> "The inexperienced guys came in when the seniors weren't playing well and did  their job," Ostoco said.  </P> <P> Cleveland has been a city playoff contender in recent years, but will have only  four returning starters.  </P> <P> La Canada has been the surprise thus far in the tournament, upsetting  seventh-seeded Dorsey in the first round. The Spartans went on to defeat Bell  Gardens and Taft to advance into a match against 10th-seeded Morningside in the  fourth round.  </P> <P> In the girls' division, Washington edged Torrance, 24-22. Charisse Sampson had  16 points, 15 rebounds, seven assists and four blocked shots for Washington.  </P> <P> Powerful Lynwood has outscored opponents by 70 points in breezing to three  victories.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <H5>  Anatomy of a Conflict </H5>   [Text] The presidential edict on the structure of federal  bodies of executive government was awaited impatiently by  workers of the Minnauka [Ministry of Science, Higher Education  and Technology Policy], but they weren't alone. Will the  ministry remain a ministry? This question troubled all who found  themselves in the zone of ``combat activities'' between the RAN  [Russian Academy of Sciences] Presidium and the leadership of  the Minnauka. Military terminology is certainly apropos in this  situation--what other than a retaliatory blow can we call the  December resolution of the RAN Presidium expressing the desire  to lower the status of the Minnauka to a state committee? This  was a response to the government's desire to cut the funding of  the RAN. It was at the Minnauka, as the structure that would  implement this policy, that the Presidium vented its wrath.    Each of the opposing sides has its own interests, which they  feel agree with state interests. And each could quite soundly  prove its righteousness. RAN leaders believe that all functions  of fundamental sciences in the academy must be preserved. But  the opinion of the government is that the state budget is unable  to maintain the RAN in the form in which it now exists, and that  priorities have to be chosen. This is what is at the root of the  conflict. But as we can see, the forms of the struggle are  arbitrary.    The ministry has remained a ministry. More than that, the RF  Committee on Information was placed within its structure by an  edict signed by President B. Yeltsin. The above-cited resolution  of the RAN Presidium evoked differing assessments from the  academic milieu. Some institute directors supported it  completely: A letter to President B. Yeltsin written on the  instructions of the Conference of Directors of Academy  Institutions of the Moscow Region is published on this page.  Extracts from letters from other Moscow directors expressing  disagreement with some provisions of the resolution,  particularly regarding the Minnauka, are presented here as well.  Academicians of the Siberian Department of the RAN also  expressed trust in the ministry. We decided to acquaint you with  these letters, because they reflect not only the concrete  situation but also a vision of how science is to live in the  future.  <H5>  Priority to the Priorities </H5>   A group of directors of the largest institutes wrote a  letter  to Russian Federation President B. Yeltsin in connection with  adoption of a resolution by the RAN Presidium on 14 December  1993 on financing the RAN and on matters relating to  administration of science. The letter's authors agree with the  provision of the resolution noting the insufficiency of basic  financing of scientific institutes both in and outside the RAN  system.    However, they believe the resolution errs when it suggests  reorganizing the RF Ministry of Science and Technology Policy as  the RF State Committee for Science and Technology, and focusing  its activity on the problems of organizing, shaping, and  monitoring fulfillment of scientific and technical programs.    In the opinion of the undersigned, institutes engaging in  fundamental science must receive basic financing at least at the  minimum level in order to preserve scientific potential, but  under the conditions of the difficult economic situation,  priority should be given to the principle of competitive  financing of science. In the last two years the RF Ministry of  Science and Technology Policy began implementing this principle  systematically, and it enjoyed certain success on this path:  Scientific collectives that achieve the greatest successes and  possess the best foundation for research in the most promising  direction receive priority financing through the Minnauka.    The authors of the letter feel this policy of the Minnauka  to  be correct in principle, and they support it. The departmental  principle of financing science proposed by the RAN Presidium,  according to which money is distributed among the institutes by  departmental leadership (in the Academy of Sciences by the RAN  Presidium) is deleterious to science--it will result in the  uniform impoverishment and demise of all science in Russia.    Therefore in the opinion of the letter's authors the  suggestion by the RAN Presidium to fundamentally reorganize the  Minnauka and sharply reduce the competitive principle will lead  us on the wrong path, and is totally unacceptable.    The letter was signed by RAN Academician S. Belyayev,  director of the Institute of General and Nuclear Physics of the  Russian Kurchatovskiy Institute Scientific Center; RAN  Academician L. Keldysh, director of the Physics Institutes of  the Academy of Sciences imeni P. Lebedev; Professor A. Simonov,  director of the Scientific Research Physicochemical Institute  imeni L. Karpov; and others, nine persons in all.  <H5>  What's the Use of Recommendations? </H5>   A message from Siberian scientists to Prime Minister V.  Chernomyrdin signed by academicians V. Koptyug, D. Knorre, D.  Derevyanko, A. Skrinskiy, V. Titov and V. Shumnyy, and RAN  corresponding members K. Svitashev, Yu. Shokin and V. Kuleshov  notes that far from all activity of the Minnauka has been  supported by the scientific community. But they feel that  ``elimination of a government body at the highest level  responsible for `meshing together' the efforts of scientific  collectives of different departments and integrating them in the  solution of the most important problems of science and applied  science threatens destruction of state scientific and technical  policy. And this harbors very grave losses for the country.  Replacement of a responsible government body by an advisory one  will not save the situation under today's conditions. The unity  of state scientific and technical policy would be lost.''  <H5>  Are These the Forms the Reform is Supposed to Take? </H5>   Now that hopeful signs of political stabilization have  appeared following adoption of the new Constitution and election  of the Federal Assembly, and sensible correction of the course  of the reforms currently under way is planned, we, the  scientists of Russia, find it necessary to state our position  regarding processes occurring in Russia and in Russian science,  without the apprehension that our opinion might be used to  incite passions and disturb equilibrium in the society.    The Russian intelligentsia was one of the main driving  forces  of the reforms and democratic transformations. It was among the  first to understand the deleteriousness of the economy's  extensive development in the former USSR, having indicated the  existence of a direct correlation between quality of life and  the need for converting the economy to new technologies created  by science. The turn in socio-economic relations to the freedom  of creativity, to the freedom of entrepreneurship for the good  of Russians is the strategic direction of the reforms that  attracted the scientific and technical intelligentsia.    But the real results of the reforms are far from what was  anticipated. A great country has been transformed before our  eyes into a helpless organism.    Scientific discoveries and new technologies that even before  were introduced into production with difficulty are now simply  unwanted. How can we discuss application of new technologies  when vitally important enterprises are being shut down, and  industrial investments are becoming purely symbolic?    Financing of Russian science has diminished to dangerous  levels. The especially grave consequences of this manifested  themselves in fundamental research. Its situation is presently  deteriorating from critical to catastrophic. Scientific  observations providing for prompt notification regarding natural  disasters (tsunamis and earthquakes for example) are coming to a  halt, the work of world-renowned scientific centers is being  terminated, and research on the most important state programs is  being abandoned.    Scientists are being forced to leave the institutes that  have  been their homes, and go abroad or join commercial organizations  in search of a better share. Young replacements are not going  into science. Scientific conferences, materials and reagents,  scientific literature, and experimental devices have become  luxuries beyond reach.    Science is an integrated living organism, and it does not  tolerate interruptions in its growth and development. Any delay  in this development may cause Russia to fall many decades and  generations behind the world cultural and technological level,  and the country to fall back to secondary scientific positions.    It has long been established that world science is  indivisible. Russian science is a recognized component of it.  The demise of Russian science cannot but have consequences, and  it will be detrimental to all world science. This understanding  of the role of Russian science is precisely one of the main  motivating factors behind the assistance being provided to it  from without. However, no assistance can replace providing for  the normal vital activities of science. Only the state can  accomplish this task.    While we are totally grateful to those who are sincerely  helping Russian science in its hour of need, we cannot ignore  the fact that Russia is sending abroad, in mass numbers and free  of charge, highly qualified scientists and specialists whose  selection and training require a great deal of time and  significant outlays. The losses to the CIS countries by the end  of the 1990's from intellectual emigration, calculated by United  Nations procedures, will be tens of millions of dollars annually.    Basic state budget financing of fundamental research,  scientific schools, and the principle of accessibility of the  sphere of science to every citizen of the country, regardless of  class membership, are the principal mechanisms by which vital  and creative energy flows into Russian science. These mechanisms  were developed over the course of centuries, and they have  demonstrated their practical effectiveness. Now they are being  destroyed.    Appropriation of budgetary assets to science by the state is  one of the forms of long-range investment. Investing assets into  science is economically advantageous, and it is a practice  followed by all developed countries.    Even in the extremely difficult years of the Great Patriotic  War and postwar devastation, the country found the possibility  to provide real support to its science, and use the results of  scientific research and development for constructive purposes.    Today, however, a strange kind of deformation has occurred  in  the society's perception of science and of the labor of  scientists. The authority of academy science has been  undermined, and its importance to the life of the country is  being glossed over.    Despite the edicts of the Russian president ``On Creation of  the Russian Academy of Sciences'' and ``On Material Support to  Russian Scientists,'' which raised the hopes of the scientific  community, economization of budgetary expenditures on  fundamental research continues. Can we really have any serious  hope of rectifying the state of affairs with the state budget by  reducing and postponing essentially negligible payments to  science? It doesn't take more than 0.5 percent of the country's  budget to support the entire Russian Academy of Sciences for a  single year, after all, at the same time that when practical use  is made of the results of scientific developments, they return  hundreds of billions, if not trillions, of rubles.    There is one other subject about which we are deeply  concerned: the appearance of information in the mass media on  plans for restructuring science that would jeopardize the very  existence of the RAN. Democratic transformations must not lead  to the destruction of the Russian scientific school, the  traditions of which ascend from the era of Peter the Great.    The path to normalization of relations between government  and  science lies through recognition of their interdependence.  Russian science will perish without government support, but  after that, not only rebirth of a democratic Russian state but  even its survival in the modern science-intensive world will be  impossible.    We believe that the existing creative potential of Russian  scientists must be mobilized to lead the country out of its  crisis.    We will support reforms directed at improving the living  conditions of the majority of Russians, and at freedom of the  creativity of the individual, at the flourishing of science, and  at modernization of production on the basis of modern high  technology and honest entrepreneurship for the good of every  inhabitant of Russia.    Scientists are ready to take part in developing the course  and program of the reforms, and in implementing them. We can  make a contribution to the Russian economy's rebirth. We have  created materials with unique properties, developed energy and  resource conserving procedures, new information technologies,  bioengineering, the means of protecting and restoring the  environment, of conserving and making sensible use of biological  resources, and of obtaining energy, new medical preparations and  medical equipment, and many other things.    Finding themselves together with most Russians in a  difficult  material position, Russian scientists are not fighting for  outlandish wages, although in civilized countries the status of  the scientist presupposes a worthy material reward. Russian  scientists demand just one thing today--the possibility for  working productively in their country, and in their professional  sphere--science.    It stands to reason that we clearly recognize the need for  improving the forms of work of both Russian science as a whole  and of its nucleus--the Russian Academy of Sciences. But we, the  scientists, must do this ourselves, and in such a way as to  preserve the best historically evolved traits of Russian science  as a phenomenon of worldwide cultural importance.    Believing the issues discussed here to be exceptionally  important to development of the positive directions of  transformations in Russia, we appeal to you to meet personally  with the leading Russian scientists at the soonest possible  moment convenient to you.    In behalf and on the instruction of directors of  academy institutes of the Moscow Region: RAN Academician Yu.  Gulyayev, Academician G. Arbatov, Academician Yu. Zolotov,  Academician N. Lyakishev, Corresponding Member Yu. Altukhov.</p>

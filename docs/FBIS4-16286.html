			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Apr 14, BNS -- Russia will not start  pulling out nuclear rods from its reactors at the naval base of  Paldiski in the second decade of March, as was established  earlier, said Juri Tikk, the Estonian Government's special  representative in Paldiski. The date for starting the work will  be most likely set on Apr. 22 or 23, when the Russian group to  carry out the dismantling is scheduled to arrive at the  facility, located some 35 kilometers to the west of Tallinn.  But Tikk expressed hope that the work will still start this  month. The two countries have already agreed upon the technical  issues pertaining to the dismantling of the reactors in the  Russian submarine crew training center.    Ago Tiiman, secretary of the Estonian delegation for talks  with Russia and head of the group for military issues of the  delegation, said Estonia had proposed what he called a totally  new plan for the dismantling. "This idea is different from the  earlier ones. Our position is that the rods must be out from  Estonia by June 30, 1994. But the rest of the work --  dismantling of the reactor corpus and taking out the solid and  liquid nuclear waste -- must take place as quickly as possible,"  Tiiman said in a press conference of the Estonian delegation.  He said the idea reminded of an earlier suggestion, according  to which the reactors would be mounted on special trailers and  taken away by ship or train. He refused to specify.    Tiiman characterized his country's new proposal as optimal.  He said work according to this scheme would cost Estonia less  than 10 million U.S. dollars.    The Estonian Cabinet at its meeting on Apr. 12 ruled to  introduce emergency regulations on the Pakri peninsula, where  Paldiski is situated, during the period of work on the reactors.  The regulations, to become effective after a decree by the  minister of the interior, will make the region again off-limits  area for outsiders. Estonian officials say that if Russia  agrees to the scheme proposed by the country, the whole process  of dismantling the reactors will take about three years.</p>

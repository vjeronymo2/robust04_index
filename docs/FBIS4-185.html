			<p>BFN     [Text] The Supreme Court of Togo yesterday annulled the  election of two Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] deputies  following an annulment suit filed by the Rally of the Togolese  People [RPT] after the second round of the legislative  elections. Serious incidents in the second constituency of Haho  and the first constituency of Wawa led to these annulments. A  few days ago, the Supreme Court invalidated the election during  the first round, of the Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD]  deputy in the first constituency of Oti because Bemba Bahissa's  alternate had not satisfied the conditions concerning residence  on the territory during the elections. Following these  annulments, the opposition still retains the majority with 40  seats -- 34 for the CAR and 6 for the UTD as against 37 for the  RPT-Union for Justice and Democracy and one for the  Confederation of New Forces.</p>

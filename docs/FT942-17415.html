			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Arts: Johnny on a Spot - London Theatre Why has the National Theatre revived Charles McArthur's forgotten 1942 political farce Johnny on a Spot? As one of those who watched most of the first night po-faced, I am curious. Partly, I guess, the National reckons that we could do with a comedy about political corruption these days. Others may say that we are now too familiar with such matters to find them funny, but that is nonsense. We need to laugh at them more than ever. And, on the crookedness of politicians, McArthur was remarkably prescient. Following his plot today, we are reminded of other statesmen who have praised family values while adulterising in private, of other rigged elections, of other mismanagements of hospital finances, of other politicians whose corpses have been found in their mistresses' homes. Yet if you revive an American play from 1942, you do so, surely, because you think you can breathe new life into it. In Richard Eyre's staging, Johnny on a Spot bursts into brilliantly funny life for about five minutes, while James Grout, as Judge Webster, tries to improvise a speech on live radio. He keeps forgetting that he's on the air, he has no notion what specific points he's supposed to be making, and he keeps misunderstanding the mime signals with which his colleagues try to feed him hints. Grout's lurching eyebrows, gaping mouth, bulging figure and booming voice all afford perfect hilarity here; and elsewhere in the play he is always a model of enchanting detail. This, however, is not enough. Most of the acting is what I want to call competent, except it is not quite competent enough to animate this farce. As Nicky Allen, Upjohn's campaign manager and the plot's central manipulator, Mark Strong has looks and energy - but not the leading-man charm and openness of spirit that this latterday Harlequin-Figaro type requires. As his gal, Julie the secretary, Janie Dee does have bright-eyed charm, but (the lines tell you) the role calls for more force of character. Amid the cast in general, even from the excellent Michael Bryant, there are too many unAmerican vowels and too much placing of the voice at back of the head, a l'anglaise. So, without quite enough style and character to animate it, the play creaks. Its various crises feel as if they are being switched on and off for dramatic convenience. Jokes crop up and fall like lead. Two of the main female characters (Pearl the madame and Barbara the Judge's niece) are caricatures of sexiness, and played so broadly by Diane Langton and Geraldine Fitzgerald that they keep verging on the grotesque. Poor Bryant struggles to make an impression more forceful than the live parrot that squawks on his wrist. Then there is the question of why Eyre &amp; co. decided on the Olivier. There are several times when different conversations or speeches overlap - a comic device that collapses when projected into the great fan shape of this auditorium. William Dudley has designed a huge glamorous hall of an office. Too huge for comic comfort; not huge enough for the stage; and the glamour is distracting.</p>

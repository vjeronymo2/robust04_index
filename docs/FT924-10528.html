			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: Svenska Kredit faces collapse SVENSKA KREDIT, Sweden's leading credit insurer, has filed for bankruptcy after its two main shareholders, Skandia and Trygg-Hansa SPP, and four major banks failed to reach agreement over its future. The collapse could have a serious impact on the ability of Swedish companies to get credit insurance cover and guarantees. However, since Svenska Kredit suspended payments, two foreign insurers - Holland's NCM and Germany's Hermes - have stepped in to fill part of the gap in the market. The insurer suspended payments on September 9 following reports that it could face losses of SKr5bn-SKr10bn (Dollars 863m-Dollars 1.72bn). Since then Skandia and Trygg-Hansa, which each own 47 per cent of Svenska Kredit, and SE Banken, Handelsbanken, Nordbanken and Sparbanken have attempted to agree an orderly winding-up of Svenska Kredit over three years. These talks collapsed, with Svenska Kredit blaming the banks. 'Since the banks were not prepared to assume risk for any part of the liquidity that Svenska Kredit could require during the winding-up period, the parties declared there were no longer any grounds for reaching agreement,' it stated. Between 1991 and September 1992, the insurer paid out SKr2.2bn to creditors whose customers were unable to meet their obligations. Skandia said it faced a maximum of SKr450m in losses as a result of the collapse, in addition to a SKr213m write-down at the interim stage.</p>

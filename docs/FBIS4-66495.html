			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hasan Rub'i] </F>   [Text] They do not live on Mars or any other planet. They  live among us. The calls for help issuing from their throats  deafen our ears. Yet, we do nothing to rescue them even though  we can. Rather we definitely can rescue them.    Their hearts beat with their love for the land on which they  have grown up and into which their roots strike deeply, defying  all the endeavors to uproot them.    They defy despair. A blow that does not kill them makes them  cling to the soil more tenaciously. They muster whatever  strength they continue to have and they move forward pace by  pace, defying the despair toward which they are led by the  occupation policies and by kinsmen's negligence, which is even  more painful and which has surpassed all bounds and exceeded all  imagination. Their will is the strong rock, which stands as a  firm barrier in the face of all endeavors to break their sacred  bond with the land. This land, whose soil has been mixed with  the sweat of their brow, is everything to them. It is the air  they breathe and the blood that runs in their veins and gives  them life. It is the forefathers' will, and it is the homeland  over which they dream of establishing their sovereignty, as all  other simple peoples do. These people are the Palestinian  farmers who live under harsh and difficult circumstances, which  no other sector could endure, especially in light of the  negligence and of injustice to which they are subjected by all  the sides that are supposed to aid them, to help alleviate their  hardship, and to curtail the immense losses they incur every  season, particularly since they constitute more than 30 percent  of the West Bank and Gaza Strip population!    What is the real condition of the Palestinian agricultural  sector today? What are the most significant obstacles facing  this sector, almost dealing it fatal blows?    Why is this sector subjected more than other sectors to  immense losses in most, not to say all, seasons right before the  eyes and within earshot of the people concerned who have  undertaken to protect and support it?    Moreover, what do farmers themselves say about the real  conditions under which they live and the losses they incur?    Finally, how do farmers see the future of agriculture in the  occupied territories, and is there hope that these conditions  will improve?    This is what AL-BAYADIR AL-SIYASI will show in this  investigative report through which we dot the i's and cross the  t's with utter objectivity and without allowing ourselves to be  carried away by our imagination in the issue of Palestinian  farmers and the future of Palestinian agriculture in the  occupied territories.  <H5>  Facts and Pains </H5>   A most significant problem that encounters a journalist when  he is gathering the material necessary for this or that report,  especially in the occupied territories, is the scarcity of  accurate figures and statistics on cultivated acreage, for  example; on the number of workers in this sector; on the annual  yield of this or that basic crop on which our farmer relies  fundamentally; on the irrigated acreage and the volume of water  needed to irrigate this acreage; and on dryland farming acreage.  Such figures and statistics are scarce despite the presence of  hundreds, not to say thousands, of agricultural associations and  organizations that have been founded in the occupied territories  to serve this sector in the first place, to attend to its  affairs, and to deal with its problems. But it seems that those  in charge of this sector do not, very regrettably, take the  trouble to conduct the necessary studies in this regard. If they  conduct a few such studies, they rely for their data on studies  conducted by the other [Israeli] side, which always distorts the  facts, especially in connection with land issues. Moreover, it  is almost impossible to get the data from government  agricultural offices that have such data because of laws that  prohibit officials from dealing with the press. Fortunate is the  journalist who manages to interview the press spokesman for one  of these offices, after a pursuit of several months at least. In  most cases, it is impossible to get such an interview for a  variety of reasons, some of which we ourselves create and some  beyond our control.    Like the Palestinian people's other sectors, the Palestinian  agricultural sector has been targeted primarily since the start  of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. This  sector has encountered a great degree of harassment and  pressures. Obstacles have been placed in the path of its  development through dozens of military directives that have  sought to diminish and wipe out this sector, especially since it  signifies a lot. Before anything else, this sector signifies the  land over which the struggle revolves between two peoples, each  of whom tries to assert its historical right to this land.  <H5>  Objective Is Disengagement </H5>   Since the start of occupation, the authorities have employed  numerous means to break the strong bond between the Palestinian  and his land, to which he clings as he clings to life. Thousands  of arable dunums of land have been used for settlement,  military, and public purposes. The area of land seized by Israel  since 1967 is 2.2 million dunums, i.e., 40 percent of the West  Bank land, which has a total area of 5.5 million dunums. This is  in addition to thousands of other dunums that have been  confiscated and on which no accurate statistics are available.  The latest such act was the announcement made just a few days  after conclusion of the declaration of principles in Washington  about the confiscation of 5,000 dunums to establish natural  protectorates in the West Bank!    Moreover, the authorities have prevented farmers from  drilling artesian wells to irrigate crops so as to ensure that  the cultivated area does not expand and to prevent the  reclamation of new lands after the water necessary for  irrigation becomes available. These authorities have employed as  pretext in this regard the Jordanian law, which they use  whenever it serves their interests. This law prohibits,  according to their allegation, drilling artesian wells for  irrigation purposes in order to preserve underground water  resources and to ensure that large quantities of this water are  not pumped out, thus increasing water salinity and making water  unfit for drinking.    The authorities also resorted to other means to besiege this  sector and to cause it to despair, considering that they have  inundated Palestinian markets with Israeli agricultural  products, thus pitting domestic Palestinian production in an  unfair competition against the developed Israeli product. These  authorities then proceeded to ban the entry of Palestinian  production to Israeli markets. In most years, they have also  banned the export of the surplus exceeding the domestic market's  need to the Arab markets, especially to Jordan.  <H5>  Occupation Is Not Only Reason </H5>   The more intelligent means to which the authorities have  resorted since the start of the occupation is to open the  various sectors of Israeli work to Palestinian farmers at very  tempting wages. At times, farmers working in these sectors  collected in one month wages exceeding their entire annual  income from farming. Thus numerous small farmers were encouraged  to abandon the land and to go to work in Israel. This, in turn,  made it easier for the authorities to confiscate vast areas of  land on the pretext that they are not exploited and cultivated.    To tell the truth, occupation is not the only reason why the  Palestinian agricultural condition has slipped to this level of  misery. The occupation charted its policy and our Palestinian  institutions have, very regrettably, implemented this policy by  neglecting this sector, by denying farmers financing that  enables them to continue to exploit and cultivate the land, and  by diverting funds allocated to aid this sector to the wrong  circles, even though agricultural institutions have proliferated  greatly in the occupied territories recently. It is well known  that in any country, the purpose of the presence of such  institutions is to serve the farmers and to look for markets to  sell their products, especially when there are no markets that  ensure that agricultural production is sold at good prices that  yield a good return for the farmer, as is the case with  Palestinian farmers today. Their purpose is also to protect land  and crops and to enlighten farmers and educate them of the  necessity of clinging to and utilizing their land that is faced  with danger if it is abandoned. But in the occupied territories,  these institutions have a different idea and their services are  confined to certain people who do not need aid in the first  place and who may be as far as can be from agriculture.  Meanwhile, small farmers suffer the worst hardship. One should  also note that dozens of these associations are no more than ink  on paper and a bank account number.    One may wonder: What is the role of the agriculture offices  that proliferate the West Bank? Very regrettably, they are in no  better a position than numerous other national institutions that  are supposed to spread awareness among farmers; to offer them  guidance and help them; to supply them with the pesticides they  need to fight maladies and diseases that devastate their crops;  and to make field visits so as to familiarize themselves with  the farmers' conditions and to acquaint them with modern farming  methods. However, rarely do these offices take the trouble to  distribute an educational leaflet on modern agriculture or on  fighting diseases that destroy crops--which have spread greatly  and in mysterious ways recently. In some seasons, the cost of  pesticides and remedies used in agriculture is more than the  farmer's returns, because pesticide prices are high and because  the remedies are adulterated at times.  <H5>  Farmer Is Victim </H5>   There are dozens of examples of negligence of the  agricultural sector, including the case of farmer 'Abdallah  'Awdah al-Rujub from Dura. Al-Rujub has been knocking on the  doors of agricultural institutions and loan institutions for  four years in an effort to save his 10-dunum farm, but to no  avail. Al-Rujub's cultivated acreage has shrunk to less than  three dunums because he has been unable to secure the funds  needed to improve the farm and to enlarge his well, which would  irrigate many times this acreage if he could realize his dreams  to deepen and broaden the well and to secure the necessary  modern irrigation equipment. Al-Rujub has obtained part of this  equipment at the expense of his children's sustenance, in the  hope that somebody will help him complete this good project.    "I have an existing project," says al-Rujub, "and it  consists  of 10 dunums of land which contain a spring. In the past, I  exploited just about one-half dunum according to the traditional  farming method of basin cultivation. Three years ago, I enlarged  the spring, making it 20 meters long, five meters wide, and two  meters deep. Using drip and sprinkler irritation, I then  cultivated nearly five dunums. I later tried to develop the  project and to enlarge the spring site even more because water  volume increases in winter. I wanted to exploit that [extra]  water to cultivate the remaining acreage in the summer. The cost  was estimated at the time at 9,000 Jordanian dinars. Had the sum  been secured, I would have been able to employ 10 people in this  project in return for a very little investment."  <H5>  Evident Discrimination in Loans </H5>   Al-Rujub went on to add, "I have been knocking at the doors  of all associations and institutions for four years, most  significantly the Economic Development Association. Very  regrettably, when I met with one of this association's officials  and explained the project to him, he said the association grants  loans for industrial purposes only, not for agriculture, keeping  in mind that the association has advanced loans for the purchase  of cattle and sheep. I am fully confident that if I had asked  the man for an industrial loan, he would have told me that they  give loans to agricultural projects only. This was not the only  request I made. Initially, I sent a registered letter to the  association. Then I delivered another letter by hand to the  secretary six months later. To date, I have not received any  response. Why?    "I wonder: Why they do not help me with a loan that I can  repay within a short period--perhaps no more than one year--from  the yield of the same land for which the loan is to be  exploited? Am I not an Arab Palestinian citizen who continues to  make sacrifices to this day? Are they fair in their loans, or do  they discriminate between one citizen and another? I wonder:  What are the criteria on which they base their loan  distribution? This is not the first time. Previously, I planted  1,000 olive trees in mountainous land that I reclaimed with  bulldozers at my own expense. Nobody offered me any loan or  assistance.    "This is not an individual issue. It is an issue experienced  by the major part of the Palestinian agricultural sector as a  result of neglect by these institutions and of evident  discrimination in the loan and aid policies at a time when lands  are being confiscated hysterically. Is it not the duty of these  institutions, which abound in the occupied territories, to  devote attention to the land and to encourage the citizen to  exploit it? Is it not their duty to support and aid farmers and  to protect the land? I raise these questions in the hope that we  will find somebody to answer them.    "I say very frankly that if, on top of the circumstances  that  are beyond our control, the current condition persists and if  this negligence continues, then say good-bye to agriculture and,  consequently, to the land. Everybody will have to be then tasked  for what he has done, and we will have to content ourselves with  `sheep and cattle' and with imaginary projects.    "The losses we incur are great and grievous losses. Yet, we  persevere, and we continue to work the land in the hope that  conditions and circumstances will improve and that some of these  losses will be recouped. The Palestinian parties concerned are  supposed to compensate us for these losses, if they are truly  concerned with the land and if their goal is to defend and  liberate the land!"  <H5>  Constant Loss </H5>   Describing the current conditions under which farmers live  and the constant losses they incur, Farmer Muhammad  'Abd-al-Hamid Muhsin has said:    "The truth is that agriculture and agricultural work are no  longer profitable under these circumstances in which loss has  become the main characteristic distinguishing this sector. This  is the result of scarcity of rain this season and of greatly  reduced prices, compared to higher planting, fertilizer, seed,  and irrigation water costs. When the crop is taken to market, it  is sold at very cheap prices, because supply is greater than  demand. This is the result of lack of farming policies and of  sound agricultural planning among farmers, the majority of whom  focus on one crop in most seasons.    "This year, farmers who rely on dryland farming have  suffered  a hard blow as a result of scarce rainfall. The blow will be  even harder for farmers who rely on irrigated farming next  summer, because underground irrigation water volume will be very  small when compared with previous years."    Muhsin went on to add, "This season is bad. Very  regrettably,  the farmer alone will incur a big loss because of the absence of  a national government and because of negligence by agricultural  associations and other institutions that are not concerned with  the agricultural sector, unlike the Israeli farmer who is  protected by the government that compensates him for his losses  and secures for him whatever he needs!    "I believe that agriculture's future is dark, especially if  favoritism persists in the departments concerned and if the  Palestinian agricultural sector continues to be treated as it is  treated currently, at a time when it is experiencing great  hardship and when it stands alone without finding anybody to  support it in its numerous ordeals."    Another farmer has said, "This sector has been facing big  problems, especially since the Palestinian associations  concerned have focused on the industrial sector exclusively,  thus inflicting a great injustice on the agricultural sector,  which employs more than 30 percent of the occupied territories'  inhabitants who rely basically on agriculture to secure their  families' livelihood.    "There is nobody to protect the Palestinian farmer or to  compensate him in these seasons in which he has suffered immense  losses because of low prices, high cost, and strong competition  by Israeli products, which invade all domestic markets, whereas  Israeli markets are banned to our products. The objective is to  deal the Palestinian farmer a blow and to protect the Israeli  farmer who lives under conditions that are greatly different  from ours."  <H5>  Marj Bin 'Amir Is Sad This Year </H5>   Farmer Yusuf 'Uraydi from 'Arrabah has said that rain  scarcity in Marj Bin 'Amir will have a very negative impact on  summer crops this year. 'Uraydi's opinion is shared by farmer  'Azmi Abu-al-Rabb, a member of the Jalbun Agricultural  Association's Executive Council, who has said, "This year, the  season will be bad because of rain scarcity. Numerous farmers in  Jalbun village have re-seeded because the major part of the seed  has rotted. Should the drought continue, God forbid, it will be  catastrophic for farmers, especially in the absence of a  government that cares for and aids them." Abu-al-Rabb added,  "The Israeli Government has declared some parts of its  agricultural areas drought-stricken lands. This declaration will  aid the Israeli farmer, whereas the Palestinian farmer finds  nobody to aid or care for him!"    Farmer Ramzi Sha'ban from al-Jalamah and farmer Hazim  Shallash from Kafra'i focused their statements on the blow  suffered by the agricultural sector this year as a result of  rain scarcity and drought.  <H5>  In Conclusion </H5>   This is the painful reality under which the Palestinian  agricultural sector lives these days. This sector has no gleam  of hope that conditions will improve in the near future, and it  displays great fear of a dark future, especially since  negligence and injustice have left their imprints on it.  Negligence and injustice have been tantamount to a hard blow  dealt this sector, which has been fighting for decades the  policy to break the bond between man and land and the attempt to  drive man away from his land through confiscation, inducements,  or successive blows. The result is immense losses incurred by  the Palestinian farmer alone. There is nobody to care for this  farmer him or to aid him farmer and help him overcome the  obstacles and march forth on his path!    This sector's future will be truly dark, especially if the  injustice inflicted on the farmers persists, as farmers say, and  if the current policies, which inevitably mean the destruction  of agriculture and abandonment of the land, continue in the  future.</p>

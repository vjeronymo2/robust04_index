			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Few likely to vote in Punjab A LOW turnout is feared today when Punjabis vote for the first time after nearly five years of direct rule from New Delhi. Sikh militants have ordered a two-day 'bandh' (general closure) which brought disruption to the northern Indian state yesterday and is expected to be enforced more forcefully today. Troops deployed to keep the peace during the fortnight's campaign, are expecting to face widespread violence today. Various factions of the Akali Dal, the main Sikh political party, are boycotting the elections under instructions from the militants. The campaign, cut short to two weeks because of the violence in the state, has been subdued. Few of the usual signs of an election - posters, loudspeakers and party flags - have been in evidence as both candidates and voters fear they will become targets of the militants. Unlike the last election in Punjab in 1985, when more than 250 candidates were backed by the militants with the aim of winning control of the legislature and then declaring independence, there are no such candidates this time. So far about 20 people have been killed in election violence - a low figure by Punjab standards. Security provided by the military for the elections has been heavy. All candidates were given protection by the army and they campaigned, if at all, quietly. Elections meetings were held by some national leaders amid tight security and before small audiences. Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, whose Congress party is one of the main contestants, did not campaign at all. Apart from the Congress, the main parties contesting the elections for 13 members of parliament and 117 members of the state legislature are the Hindu revivalist Bharatiya Janata Party and the Marxists. Also in the fray is a small, inconsequential faction of the Akali Dal whose leader, Mr Amrinder Singh, was elected unopposed before the campaign started when his opponents withdrew. It is believed they withdrew because they wanted at least a token Akali presence in the new Punjab legislature. Mr Amrinder Singh is thought to be backed by the Congress and is tipped to become chief minister of Punjab if no party wins a majority.</p>

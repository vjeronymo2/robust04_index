			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> &bull;This section should not apply to: 1) delays by lenders  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or guarantors in delivering loan proceeds which are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> caused by the necessity of complying with Title IV  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements; and 2) delays attributable to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student's not providing information by known,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published, or noticed deadlines, that the institution,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lender, or guarantor must have in order to comply with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV requirements. (Example, IRS 1040 forms for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verification.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary should regulate in such a way that it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clear that institutions may charge reasonable interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on unpaid bills where the delay in Title IV delivery is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attributed to the student or an agency other than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution. [Kansas City]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;This section does not address delays for which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student has not met public deadlines or performed all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligations necessary to ensure the delivery of timely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aid. [Kansas City]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;If the student does not provide documents, it is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable. It should relate only to a 30 day delayed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disbursement. [Atlanta]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;No constraints should be put on a student for the delay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of that portion of tuition covered by the first-time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Stafford loan or in the case of institutional delay.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [New York]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Consideration should be given to the laws of various  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> states since they differ as to when a student must meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> his or her financial obligation at an institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [San Francisco]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. If a delay is caused by the lender or institution can the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guarantee agency take actions that are prohibited under other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;No, a guaranty agency should not be allowed to take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action if the delay is caused by the lender or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution. [New York]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;G. Section 487(a)(20) prohibits an institution from paying a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commission, bonus or other incentive payment based directly or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any person or entity engaged in any student recruiting or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> admission activities or in making decisions regarding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> awarding of student financial assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Issues that the community was asked to address and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community's views:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. How should the Department determine that an institution is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not providing commissions, bonuses, and other incentive payments?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Compliance should be determined through the audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process. Auditors check employment and payroll  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records. [San Francisco, Atlanta]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. If an institution awards merit pay to salaried employees in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increments as the student successfully completes portions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> course, graduates, or gets placed in a job, would the institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be in compliance?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Institutions should be allowed to provide merit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incentives to employees as long as it cannot be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attached to the enrollment process (i.e., servicing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retaining, and placing students after the first day of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> class at the institution.) [Kansas City]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Salaried employees should be rewarded for retention.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any compensation (non-salaried) for the enrollment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial aid students is illegal. There appears to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opposition to compensating for the ``warm body count''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and financial aid packages, but it does seem that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statute allows for a legitimate basis for compensation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above base salary for areas such as retention, however  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defined, and/or completion rates. [New York]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;As the intent appears to be elimination of head count  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recruitment commissions, bonuses on merit pay may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made as long as they are not made solely as the basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of recruitment of the student. The Department should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> define who is an employee. [Atlanta]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The institution would be in compliance if an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution awards merit pay to salaried employees in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increments as the student successfully completes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portions or the course, graduates, or gets placed in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> job.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Several political parties have taken positions  for or against Judge Emile Jonassaint in the provisional  presidency of the Republic. After a week of observation, some  political parties have begun to take positions on the 11 May  provisional decision. Clarence Renois filed a report:    [Begin Renois recording] First, the socialists from National  Congress of Democratic Movement are hoping for a quick return to  constitutional order. The party of Professor Victor Benoit,  minister of National Education in the resigning Robert Malval  government, called on all Haitian democrats to express  solidarity for the purpose of provoking a return to  constitutional order.    A small party, which had supported the appointment of Judge  Jonassaint, Pastor Vladmir Jeanty's Haitian Party of God, now  dissociates itself from the new government. Pastor Jeanty says  this team is not credible and has a negative profile. [passage  omitted]    In opposition, Eddy Volel's party, the Christian Democratic  Assembly, sees a dictatorship being installed in the country.  The party's spokesman finds proof of this in the governmental  press release, warning against any offenses to the current  authorities. [passage omitted]    The MDN [Mobilization for National Development] of Professor  Hubert de Ronceray, who had established some distance from the  Jonassaint government even though he had previously supported  it, is now consulting with the Jonaissant government. Between 19  and 22 May, Professor De Ronceray met three times with three  delegations of the provisional government. Following those  talks, a special consulting commission was formed by the MDN.  This commission is in charge of meeting with ministerial  authorities and studying the policy planned by the government in  an effort to confront the total embargo ordered by the United  Nations against Haiti, according to a press release from the  party.    Two other major parties, Nationalistic Progressive  Revolutionary Party of Haiti, led by Serge Gilles; and Movement  For the Establishment of Democracy in Haiti, led by former Prime  Minister Marc Bazin, took a stand against the arrival of Emile  Jonassaint in the provisional presidency of the Republic,  especially denouncing the unconstitutional character of the  provisional government.

			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPANION OMISSIONS  </P> <P> Thank you for writing about the strange omissions in the Oxford Companion to  English Literature (Book Review, Feb. 12).  </P> <P> While I realize that your comments were directed toward a comparison between  the Oxford book and the Cambridge Guide to Literature in English, it might  interest you to learn that there is no mention of Isabel Colgate and Roald  Dahl, both proper British subjects as far as I know. This seemed so odd that I  simply stopped looking for more quirkiness.  </P> <P> Also, in Oxford's rush to drown us in printed words and imperil our forests,  they have produced several volumes of collected articles such as the ones on  female jazz singers that did not even dignify the effort with an index. I  recall a time when such fine bookstores as the old Pickwick would not even  order books such as this that came without an index.  </P> <P> Anyway, your comments were salutary and might, I would hope, help to bring this  rampant spinning of words gently but firmly to heel.  </P> <P> JAMES D. HIGSON  </P> <P> NEWPORT BEACH  </P></p>

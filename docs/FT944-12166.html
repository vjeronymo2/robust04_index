			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / FT Review of Business Books (14): A revisionist explanation  -The British system is now similar, in scale if not yet in ethos, to that in the rest of Europe and the US / Higher education 'HIGHER EDUCATION AND CORPORATE REALITIES: CLASS, CULTURE AND THE DECLINE OF GRADUATE CAREERS' by Phillip Brown and Richard Scase UCL Press, Pounds 12.95, 208 pages Two grand phenomena are examined in this book. The first has been grindingly reiterated for decades: the decline of big-bad bureaucracies, whether in the public or private sectors, and the corresponding rise of 'flexible' organisations, lean and loose-coupled with flat hierarchies, all but their core activities contracted out or cost-centred. According to business gurus and social analysts, we are on the cusp of the Fordist and post-Fordist ages. The second, less widely rehearsed phenomenon, is the expansion of higher education. During the past 10 years, almost in a fit of absent-mindedness, Britain has acquired a mass system. With a third of young people, and a growing number of the not-so-young, going on to universities or colleges, the British system is now similar, in scale if not yet in ethos, to higher education in the rest of Europe and the US. This book, written by two University of Kent sociologists, is an attempt to relate these two trends. They offer a revisionist, counter-intuitive explanation. The standard account stresses cause and effect. Universities and other higher education institutions have expanded to meet a growing need for highly skilled labour and, through their research, help build a technology-based economy. This was true yesterday. The American land-grant universities - California, Michigan, Wisconsin and the rest - were established to unlock the (largely agricultural) wealth of the west in the post-Civil War decades, and our civic universities founded in the nineteenth century grew, although obliquely, out of the industrial revolution. A generation ago, the link between the Robbins-induced expansion of the universities and Harold Wilson's 'white heat of the technological revolution' was taken for granted. It is true today. Much of the recent expansion of students has been in occupationally relevant subjects such as business studies and the 'softer' sciences and technologies. The title of this year's White Paper on science and technology was Realising Our Potential, and an explicit reference to wealth-creation (along with improving the quality of life) has been included in the missions of the reorganised research councils. It will be true tomorrow. Advanced economies are knowledge-based. Profits are generated more by the application of ideas than the intensive exploitation of raw materials or the increasing productivity of labour - or, rather, the latter are dependent on the former. In the post-industrial economy, wired into and up by the super-highways of Information Technology, universities as leading components of the knowledge industry are key players. The authors offer a contrary interpretation. They cast doubt on these supposedly symbiotic links between the development of advanced economies and the growth of mass higher education systems. They argue that the latter is far better explained in terms of the accumulation of cultural capital - socio-economic status as embodied in intellectual manners and academic qualifications - than of enhanced investment in human capital - the demand for more sophisticated expert skills and the satisfaction of this demand. Indeed, they push their revisionism two stages further. First, they argue that universities, as organisations, and so the careers for which they prepare their graduates, reflect the old world of planned bureaucracy, both welfare state and industrial-age. The professional society of which the former were agents and which was reflected in the latter is being rapidly eroded. Second, to the extent that a post-Fordist economy, and the 'flexible' organisations that are its hallmark, value 'charismatic' and 'transferable' skills more highly than bureaucratic and technical skills, the effect may be a regression to older criteria for assessing the comparative worth of higher education graduates. Self-confidence, 'character' may count for more than either expertise or experience in the future. Their conclusions are based on comparatively small-scale surveys of student attitudes and employer expectations. The students surveyed were at Oxbridge, a 'Home Counties' university and an 'Inner City' university. The empirical evidence produced by these surveys is suggestive rather than conclusive, and predictable. It is not difficult to elicit examples of juvenile arrogance from Oxbridge students or envious under-confidence from their polytechnic peers. But whether they can sustain weighty theorising is more doubtful. Also, the thrust of their conclusions is unclear. If universities must prepare graduates for 'flexible' careers, the more enterprising institutions less burdened by donnish baggage should be at an advantage. But if new-style 'charisma' is going to be boiled down to old-fashioned 'character', the more traditional universities will benefit. However, this intriguing book serves to emphasise two key points. First, mass higher education is a social and cultural phenomenon, although not perhaps a class phenomenon as the authors suggest. Expansion has been the result of push from below, not pull from above. Its primary imperative is the democratic not the skills revolution; its purpose, more cynically, to preserve social order. Second, in the (post-?)modern economy where production has yielded pride of place to consumption and a truly global market has eroded national differentiation, traditional assumptions about the tight, even causal, association between modernity - secular, liberal, sceptical and free-market values - and modernisation, the process of technology-driven wealth creation, may need to be rethought. This book is a valuable aid to such re-thinking. Modernity may no longer be a necessary precondition of modernisation which would leave universities, synthesisers of both, in an awkward corner.</p>

The program will involve field trips, artist talks and in-school  workshops.  </P> <P> Mattola received her bachelor's degree in fine arts from the Rhode Island  School of Design. She begins her new job June 1.  </P> <P> OCCCA has also appointed a new 12-member board of directors, drawn primarily  from the business community. Board chairman is Richard Fair of Laguna Beach,  owner of Encore Advertising in Long Beach. Vice chairman Bernard Simon is an  accountant with Worth &amp; Co. in Orange. Kathleen Kaplan, an OCCCA affiliate  artist, has been appointed secretary, and the treasurer is artist Diana  Frawley.  </P> <P> Four of the board members are artists who will act as liaisons among the  membership, board and staff, which also includes nine unpaid members who choose  and schedule exhibitions. Three board positions remain to be filled with more  business community members. For more information, call (714) 549-4989. CATHY  CURTIS  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Trond Bo: "Increasing Russian Military Activity"] </F>   [Text] The election in Russia could lead to a more unstable  military situation with additional forces put into position, a  Norwegian admiral feels.    The unstable situation in Russia and a reduction in advance  stockpiling for allied air support were the central topics at  the annual news conference at the Southern Norwegian Defense  Command in Stavanger yesterday.    Vice Admiral Bjorner Kibsgaard, the commander in chief in  southern Norway, said that the result of the Russian  parliamentary election points toward a more unstable situation  in Russia. He characterized statements made by certain new  leaders after the election as blatant ambition.    Kibsgaard indicated that in the last two months there has  been intense training activity on a Russian aircraft carrier  Admiral Kusnetsov, but that it will take years for the ship to  operate with the planned air strength of Flanker and  Frogfoot--NATO terms for Russian aircraft.    "The Russian military is undergoing a hefty downsizing, but  remains a modern and effective force despite extensive  reductions," said Captain Christian Grundt, who is chief of  intelligence and security at the Southern Norwegian Defense  Command.    Since 1992, the standing forces in Russia have been cut to  1.2 million soldiers, but a combat-ready, standing emergency  force of 200,000 men is maintained. Training activity has  increased in the last year, and there have been 150 sorties  along the Norwegian coast as far south as Stavanger. The  strategic submarine fleet with nuclear weapons onboard is on  maneuvers just as before and moves continually with its nuclear  cargo in the Barents Sea. There continues to be a capability  ready for use whenever called upon.    Parallel with this plan, the NATO countries, with Norway  leading, are planning joint exercises in the northern regions,  in which Russia would participate. These would not be complex  military exercises, but rescue exercises and training aimed at  working together in a UN context.    The Russians have also adopted a new military doctrine,  passed by the Russian security council on 9 November and  approved by President Boris Yeltsin.    "What is new in the military doctrine is the fact that the  Russians state they do not have any declared enemies and that  their security goal is to prevent war," said Kibsgaard and  stressed that the old political ideology was now gone.    Russia promises not to use force against other states unless  their nation or other allied nations are targets of aggression.  Nuclear weapons are to be regarded as deterrents, and Russia  distances itself from first strike with nuclear weapons. Under  certain circumstances, Russia retains the right to use nuclear  weapons.    As to its relationship with neighboring countries and former  Soviet republics, there is uncertainty with regard to the  objectives of the Russian military in protecting Russian  interests, which include those in foreign territories.  <H5>  Political Leadership </H5>   In answer to a question from AFTENPOSTEN as to whether the  new military doctrine will lead to stronger political control  over the military, Kibsgaard said:    "The military power apparatus has a lot of influence, but  from what we have seen, the political authorities have control  over the military."    With regard to the dramatic days in October, the commander  in  chief felt there was some uncertainty as to whether the Army  remained loyal to Yeltsin because they supported him or because  they saw their own purposes best served by quelling the  uprisings. At present, the defense command is familiar only with  the published version of the military doctrine. Kibsgaard felt  that it was still too early to comment on possible changes in  Russian military strategy.</p>

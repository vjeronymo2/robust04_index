			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Building society law up for review: Treasury to examine rules on mergers, takeovers and changes of status A full review of the Building Societies Act, which sets out the regulatory regime for societies, is to be undertaken by the government as part of the de-regulation initiative. The Treasury is expected to announce today that, together with the Building Societies Commission, the sector's statutory regulator, it is to look again at the provisions which have governed the activities of societies since 1986. The Building Societies Association will also be involved. Areas which will be open for discussion will include the present limit of 40 per cent on funds which societies can raise on the wholesale markets, and the merger and takeover procedures for societies. The process for societies which change their status, as Abbey National did, will also be reviewed. Some of the larger societies want greater access to wholesale funds, where borrowing is cheaper, so that they can offer more attractive deals to potential borrowers. Competition in this area is intense, and societies have been losing market share to the banks. 'The financial services sector has changed considerably since the building societies legislation was passed seven years ago,' one industry expert said, 'and the regulation ought to reflect that.' The first tranche of the review is expected to end by early summer. The govern-ment hopes to complete the process by the end of this year, perhaps after further consultation in the autumn. On this timescale, the conclusions would be ready soon after the time by which the de-regulation bill should have become law. They could thus be early candidates for the use of the new powers in the bill, which enable ministers to amend primary legislation through orders. The wider review complements the more technical changes affecting building societies which are included in the de-regulation bill as well as in the conclusions of the task force which advised the Department of Trade and Industry on de-regulation in the financial services sector. The de-regulation bill itself contains two new powers for societies. First, they would be able to lend to a borrower against land held by a third party. This would mean, for example, that when a borrower has negative equity in his or her own house, a society could, for example, use the borrower's parents' house as additional security. Second, they would be allowed to take a direct part in syndicated lending, with the removal of the existing restriction that means they can do so only through subsidiary 'lending societies' prescribed by the regulator. Other measures which are likely to follow include a streamlining of the procedures determining how societies notify and consult their millions of members about their activities. Another technical change - in the way in which societies' permanent interest-bearing shares and subordinate debt are classified - would give a limited amount of greater flexibility in terms of the societies' wholesale funding limits, even without any change in the overall limit.</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Arts: Face lift for Portrait gallery - The new Wolfson gallery's inaugural show at the NPG Reports of the death of the portrait are greatly exaggerated. The works now on view at the the inaugural show in the new Wolfson Gallery of the National Portrait Gallery offer proof of non-extinction. But are they any good? That is another question. The exhibition, called The Portrait Now, celebrates the conclusion of almost two decades of discussion about the development of the gallery and includes works from around the world produced since about 1980. It represents an attempt by the gallery to do the most natural thing in the world after a major refurbishment - to show off, drawing on its own and other public and private collections. Unfortunately, however, it offers rather more than it delivers - the parts being greater than the sum, although it also offers a chance to see the great improvements made to the gallery itself. About Pounds 8m was raised from private charitable funds, trusts and individual benefactors, to which the government added a further Pounds 4m for the expansion of the gallery. Founded in 1896 as the first purpose-built portrait gallery in the world, then NPG had long out-grown itself. Throughout the 1980s there was talk of moves and extensions, as opportunities came and went, but at last, in 1988, the issue was resolved by the acquisition of the premises across the road from the Gallery. The new site houses a new Archive and Library (funded by the Drue Heinz Foundation), and a new Conservation Studio (Headley Trust) and gallery offices. In the main building, the old basement has been converted into an Education Centre (Baring Foundation, Pilgrim Trust, Marks &amp; Spencer), Studio (Clore Foundation) and Darkroom. The most evident change, however, is to the old Level 1 where the offices and boardroom were, which is now remodelled and made over entirely to the display of the 20th century collection, photography, and temporary exhibitions. The new entrance on the corner of Orange Street at last affords proper access for the disabled (Hayward, and Sports &amp; Arts Foundations). The temporary exhibitions gallery has been used for this inaugural exhibition. It shows that, whatever may have been said about the demise of portrait painting, the human presence and identity will always be a fit subject for the artist, no matter whether or not he sets himself up as Portrait Painter complete with brass plate on the studio door. But does portrait painting have any vitality left in the late 20th century? The evidence of this selection is that so many of those artists who achieved international fame and fortune in this late period are simply not very good. While the roll call sounds impressive - Baselitz, Penck, Fetting, Schnabel, Clemente, Salle, Bevan, Hamilton . . . need I go on? - too often the works are less so. It is one thing to indicate a human face or figure, quite another to resolve it to the point of invoking a unique identity. Such particularity is not necessarily a matter of long and detailed scrutiny, for much may be achieved quickly and with little. Here Bacon and Auerbach, and the less well-known Stephen Finer and Tom Wood, all show works in which the face, the presence, is not so much described as conjured out of the paint. From the Baselitzes and Schnabels we have only infantile indulgence. The less well-known, and those more modest in the face of the task they have taken, on infinitely the more successful and supply the chief pleasures of the show. Sara Raphael's Gary Sobers is comparatively tiny and densely worked, but none the less powerful and monumental for that. She is as good a portraitist as any we have. Michael Andrews (Serena), Tai-Shan Schierenberg (John Mortimer), John Wonnacott (Ian with Renown IV), Peter Edwards (Seamus Heaney), Avigdor Arikha (Lord Home) all show distinguished works, and Glenys Barton's ceramic bust of Jean Muir is the outstanding sculpture, so deceptively simple, and so profound. The portrait is alive and well after all. The re-display of the later 20th century collections is a wonderful relief after the cramped regime of recent years. The hang is now, if anything, over-spacious, but a little such self-indulgence quite forgivable for the moment. The arrangement is more or less by category of sitter - politicos, clerics, artists, scientists and so on - and inevitably wonderfully intriguing in its conjunctions, for it is in the very nature of the collection that the aesthetic quality of the work in question is not always, or even, a consideration. One gratifying quality, however, is the way in which the long-term benefit of the annual Portrait Award, sponsored first by John Player and now by BP, is becoming ever more apparent, as its commissions come in to strengthen the collections. Several of the rooms have been specially endowed, including the Kaye Gallery for science and technology and the Porter Gallery, which is to be given over to recent acquisitions and commissions. The latest include Lord Annan carved by Glynn Williams, Lord Whitelaw by Humphrey Ocean and the Rev Chad Varah by Sara Raphael. The Photography Gallery has been funded by the Elm Trust, and is kicks off with The NPG Collects (sponsored by British Gas), a prime selection of recently acquired images from the 1930s to the present day, from Paul Tanqueray to Helmut Newton, and, as subjects, from Evelyn Waugh to French and Saunders. Dr John Hayes, who has been its director since 1974, retires at the New Year. The present state of the National Portrait Gallery, at last full of works of art and full, too, of life, is a worthy tribute to him and a magnificent legacy to his successor. The Portrait Now: The National Portrait Gallery, St Martin's Place WC2, until February 6.</p>

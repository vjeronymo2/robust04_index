			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: First-half profits at Fanuc plunge 28% SLACK sales of industrial robots to the motor industry were blamed for a plunge in half-year profits at Fanuc, the world's largest machine tool manufacturing equipment maker. Unconsolidated pre-tax profits for the first six months to September fell 28.2 per cent to Y11.6bn (Dollars 109.4m) on a 9.7 per cent decline in sales to Y56.2bn. After-tax profits fell 29.5 per cent to Y6.5bn. Sales at the robot division tumbled by 23 per cent to Y14bn. Industrial robots for the auto industry accounted for 50 per cent of total robot sales, down from the previous 70 per cent. Factory automation equipment declined 11.7 per cent to Y33.9bn. However, exports to Taiwan and South Korea were brisk, pushing Fanuc's export ratio above 40 per cent for the first time. During the second half of the year, the company will focus on sales of plastic injection molding machines, the only item to produce firm profits. Plant and equipment investments for the second half will fall by 50 per cent from the previou year, the company said. For the full year to March, Fanuc expects non-consolidated pre-tax profits to fall 27.3 per cent to Y21.2bn on a 10.1 per cent decline in sales to Y105.7bn.</p>

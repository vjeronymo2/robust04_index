			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / International Company News: National Semi has strong final quarter NATIONAL Semiconductor, the Silicon valley chip manufacturer which has been restructuring itself, yesterday reported sharply higher fourth-quarter net earnings of Dollars 27.5m, up from Dollars 5.6m a year ago. Mr Gilbert Amelio, president and chief executive, said the figures represented 'the best profit performance for semiconductor operations in any quarter in the past five years'. Sales totalled Dollars 491.5m, compared with Dollars 444.9m, and earnings per share worked through at 22 cents, against 3 cents. The quarter included 14 weeks rather than the normal 13. Mr Amelio said that taking this into account, sales and earnings still increased in the fourth quarter, both year to year and compared with the third quarter. Gross margins achieved the company's goal of 30 per cent, due mainly to cost reductions from the restructuring programme. The results were also helped by an Dollars 11m after-tax gain from patent licensing fees. The company said business conditions during the quarter showed strong seasonal improvement, with worldwide bookings up substantially over the third quarter and over the previous year's fourth quarter. Computer peripheral bookings continued to improve and automotive orders showed strong gains over 1991's unusually low levels. National Semi said that it expected economic trends to improve slightly in the coming fiscal year, 'but not enough to offset the normal seasonal patterns in bookings and shipments'. It had entered the current quarter with an improved backlog and had not yet seen the normal summer seasonal slowdown. For the full year, the company reported a net loss of Dollars 120.1m, or Dollars 1.24 a share, on sales of Dollars 1.72bn This compared with a loss of Dollars 151.4m, or Dollars 1.56, on sales of Dollars 1.7bn in 1991.</p>

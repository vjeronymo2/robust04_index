			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / International Company News: Rolo board accepts Cariplo bid The board of Credito Romagnolo (Rolo), the Bologna-based commercial bank, has accepted the L3,300bn (Dollars 2bn) overture from its new suitor, the consortium led by Cariplo, Italy's biggest savings bank. Board approval following weekend meetings was widely expected following the Cariplo consortium's unexpectedly generous offer last week. The consortium offered L21,500 per share for 70 per cent of Rolo's stock. This was not only L1,500 more per share than the improved offer made by the recently privatised Credito Italiano (Credit) but also extended to 70 per cent of the shares instead of the 63.6 per cent proposed to shareholders by Credit. Rolo declined to comment formally on the meeting; but the board was apparently unanimous in deciding that the Cariplo offer was more advantageous. The Credit bid, first launched in October, has always been regarded by the bulk of the board as hostile. The Cariplo bid was first mounted in conjunction with Carisbo, the main savings institution in Emilia Romagna and IMI, the treasury-controlled bank. But this trio has now been joined by Reale Mutua, the insurance group. The next step will be for the Bank of Italy to pronounce upon the counter-offer, having already given the green light to Credit. The Bank of Italy is likely to have already been sounded out informally, not least because behind-the-scenes discussions between Rolo and Milan-based Cariplo have taken place at intervals for much of the year. The Bank of Italy may not be entirely happy at the prospect of Rolo, one of the healthiest private commercial banks, being controlled by banking institutions which have yet to be privatised. But this is unlikely to halt the deal. Only when approval has been given can the counter-bid be formalised. Given the Christmas break, this could mean a delay until the second week in January. The main imponderable now is whether Credit will accept defeat without a further fight. Credit's bid would cost the bank L2,800bn and most analysts have ruled out its raising the stakes without help. Over the weekend there were press reports that Credit might be enlisting the support of Allianz, its leading German shareholder, as well as Banca Commerciale Italiano.</p>

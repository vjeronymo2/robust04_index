			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Foreign Affairs: Islam and integration - Western societies are divided over their relationship with their Moslem communities No one seems to know exactly how many Moslems there are in Britain. Probably not more than 1m, but they are unevenly spread. In Birmingham, they make up 10 per cent of the population. Yet even Birmingham will not have a single Moslem MP in the next parliament. No political party in this election has adopted a Moslem candidate for a winnable seat. Stop, stop. Don't turn the page. This is indeed the Foreign Affairs column. But the subject of Moslem communities in western countries is, par excellence, one where foreign and domestic affairs overlap. This became clear over last weekend during a fascinating conference on the subject at Ditchley Park, the international affairs seminar centre. The existence of such communities is a relatively recent phenomenon, going back only a generation or so. Their members, even when born in and citizens of their present country of residence, are still generally perceived by the rest of the population as 'immigrants'. Moreover, they belong, for the most part, to ethnic groups which are easily distinguishable from the majority population by their physical appearance. One of the unresolved questions is whether they should not be classified as ethnic or religious minorities. It was argued, especially by French participants, that to insist on their Moslem character tends to reinforce their ethnic separateness - to force them into a ghetto - by superimposing on them a largely artificial religious identity. Only 6 per cent of Arabs in France, it was claimed, regularly attend mosques. If asked, they will no doubt identify themselves as Moslems, but they should not be asked. In fact, the French census carefully avoids asking such questions. One French specialist even asserted that in order to integrate these people into French society, it was necessary to 'disintegrate' their separate communal identities. They should be treated just as Jews were in the French Revolution, according to the formula of Clermont-Tonnerre: 'All rights for the Jews as individuals, nothing for them as a nation.' One might think that an individual schoolgirl would have the right to wear a headscarf at school if she (or her parents) so chose. Not so. This, we learned, was not an individual gesture. It was a deliberate challenge to the authorities by an organised group seeking to claim leadership of the 'Moslem' community and to oblige the state to negotiate with it. Had one girl been allowed to wear the headscarf, others would have followed the fashion, and it would have become a badge of ethnic identity, marking off the Moslems from their fellow citizens. As it was, the state stood firm and the mass of the Arab population accepted its decision. There spoke la republique une et indivisible. We Anglo-Saxons listened, and gulped. Most of us felt that, for once, we had managed this matter better in England. Here, after all, we have never fully separated religion from the state. We have an established church, which once aspired, in the days of the 17th-century theologian Richard Hooker, to include 'every man that is of the common weal', but which long since came to terms with the fact that it has to co-exist with other religious communities and to share with them, even if unequally and grudgingly, the goods that the state has to offer. Thus there is no absolute distinction between church schools and state schools. They overlap in the category of 'voluntary aided schools', which have an explicit denominational character, yet are financed almost entirely from public funds. Most are Anglican, but Roman Catholic, Methodist and even Jewish ones can be found. So why not Moslem ones? Faced with this question, the English consensus quickly broke up. Some of us began to think the French had a point after all. Remembering the divisive effects of separate denominational schools in Northern Ireland, we shrank from encouraging Moslems to educate their children separately. We even wondered about their reasons for wishing to do so. Was it not to maintain the control of men over women, and of self-proclaimed religious leaders over 'the community' as a whole? Certainly they were entitled to equal treatment but perhaps, in the name of equality, it would be better to do away with church schools, or at least to force them into the private sector. (The French, we were told, had been prepared in the name of equality to forbid Jewish boys to wear skullcaps at school, although previously this had not been an issue.) Let the state school be a melting-pot a l'americaine, in which different cultures can be fused into something uniquely and splendidly British. At this point, however, our American colleagues deserted us. The melting-pot, they said, had long since been abandoned. Different cultures should not be forcibly merged, but cherished as something that 'enriched' a pluralist society. Admittedly, church and state are legally separate in the US, and therefore there are no state-funded church schools. But at one time there had been a serious question whether Catholic schools, in which a doctrine then seen as hostile to democracy would be taught, should be allowed in America at all. In the end they had been, and had proved to be, a great civilising and democratising influence. If Britain wished to integrate its Moslem citizens, it should show similar confidence, allowing them to take charge of their own children's education provided they accepted the national curriculum and educational standards set by the state. On the whole I was convinced by this argument. We are unlikely to achieve a real convivencia between Moslems and non-Moslems if we continue to describe Islam as a problem. Of course, Moslems do have problems, and not all of them are of the west's making (although some are). Moslems have a lot of work to do in interpreting their own religion and applying it to the life of a modern democratic society in which the majority of their fellow citizens follow other faiths or none. They are certainly not helped by being associated, in the minds of those fellow citizens, with unpleasant foreign regimes which issue death sentences against British novelists, or with groups which blow up aircraft and take hostages. Such events arise either from disputes among Moslems or as a reaction to western interventions in the Islamic world, but non-Moslems tend to see them as part of a grand Islamic design to attack the west. There is no such design, nor even any Islamic leadership capable of conceiving one. The Moslem community is already quite sufficiently disintegrated, in fact too much so. Greater integration among Moslems could help rather than hinder their integration into a pluralist western society. Western states will not achieve that by identifying or imposing a religious leadership and making it responsible for the Moslem community, as was the practice of some Moslem states in the past when dealing with non-Moslem minorities. But political parties and other institutions might help if they made a greater effort to involve individual Moslems, and promote them to positions of responsibility. Young Moslem activists in Britain, we were told, felt 'empowered' by Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwa against Salman Rushdie because for the first time it forced British society to pay attention to their views. There must be better ways for Moslems to win attention and a share of power than that.</p>

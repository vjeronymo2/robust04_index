			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / International Company News: Honda net plunges 62% in first term THE rapid appreciation of the yen and weak demand in leading markets depressed first-quarter consolidated profits at Honda, the Japanese carmaker, which yesterday reported a 62 per cent drop in net income for the period. Honda saw consolidated revenues in the three months ended June fall by 17 per cent to Y919.6bn (Dollars 8.9bn) compared with Y1,112bn previously. Pre-tax profits fell to Y15.3bn, or less than half their previous level of Y34.2bn. Honda said it had been severely affected by the sharp rise of the yen which hit profits in its largest markets overseas, particularly the US, where it sold more cars than in its home market. The company is re-examining its forecast of Y4,000bn in revenues for the entire year, which was made on expectations of an average yen-dollar exchange rate at Y115 to the dollar. The yen has recently been fluctuating closer to a rate of Y103 to the dollar. The rise of the yen's value has already led to a loss of Y25bn, even after taking into effect any gains made from hedging, Honda said. Motorcycle sales were firm in unit terms, rising 12 per cent from the first quarter of last year. However, due to the impact of the higher yen, sales in the division were 2.6 per cent lower at Y146bn. Honda has seen strong demand for its motorcycles in the US and Asia, excluding Japan. Demand in the US rose strongly as Honda has offered more higher value-added models while growth in Asia was spurred as incomes in the region have risen. Car sales fell 21 per cent in value terms to Y704.9bn and 11 per cent in unit terms, reflect-ing the continued weakness of demand in all of Honda's leading markets outside of the Asian region, excluding Japan. 'The current level of the yen will make it very difficult for us to carry out our operations,' Honda said. It has been forced to raise US prices once this year and would suffer if it raised them again. Honda expects to shift more production overseas. Exports from its US facilities, which could step up capacity, could increase in future not only to Japan where its US-made Accord is selling well, but to other parts of the world. The company has implemented cost-cutting efforts, reduced one of its lines in Japan to one shift, cut seasonal workers by about half and transferred some car staff to motorcycle operations.</p>

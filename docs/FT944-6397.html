			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Aristide wants US troops to disarm crime gangs Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's president, has asked the US government to allow its troops to become active in disarming criminal gangs and renegade army units which he fears pose a threat to the country's stability. However, the request is unlikely to be entertained by the US government, diplomats in Haiti said this week, as the move could bring the 12,000 troops in the country in direct confrontation with armed Haitians, leading to US casualties and fatalities, and increasing pressure for the troops' withdrawal. Mr Aristide's request suggests growing concern about the security situation in Haiti, which has been generally quiet since the president was reinstated last month after three years in exile. However, Senator Robert Dole, who will lead the Republican majority in the new Congress, has said disarming of Haitians should be done by the Haitian police. There is yet no adequate local constabulary to do this as the reorganisation of Haiti's armed forces, one of the first tasks of the recently reinstalled government, will take longer than was first assumed. This has raised questions about public security and the timing of the pullout of the US troops who are currently responsible for law and order. Haitian and US officials say the recruitment and training of the security forces, mainly a new constabulary, is already proving more difficult than first thought. The unpopularity of soldiers and policemen, repeatedly accused of widespread abuses during the three years of the military dictatorship, is deterring many prospective officers. With a likely rise in pressure from Republican legislators for an early pullout of US troops, Haitian officials fear a security vacuum in the country if the refashioned army and police are not ready by the time foreign troops leave. Such a situation would be 'destabilising' as it could be exploited by 'anti-government forces and bandits,' said one official. A programme agreed by Mr Aristide will see the dismantling of Haiti's 7,000 member army, and creation of a new militia of 1,500. The police force of 1,500, which is an arm of the military, will be placed under civilian control and increased to about 10,000 members. Concerns about security led Mr Aristide to bring forward the appointment of new chiefs for the army and the police. He appointed Brig Gen Bernadin Poisson, the former head of the military's fire fighting unit, as the army's new commander-in-chief. The fire services are part of the military.</p>

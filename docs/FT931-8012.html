			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Securities industry at odds with EC THE European Commission's plans to oversee EC securities markets should be amended to give practitioners in the markets more say, according to the International Securities Market Association. The call, in a report on the development of a single European securities market, highlights a growing struggle between officials in Brussels and market practitioners over how the EC's markets should be run. The Commission plans to set up a Securities Industry Committee to oversee the implemention of its legislation on securities markets and to recommend any legislative changes - a development which has prompted fears in some quarters that it will lead eventually to a centralised and bureaucratic market regulator. The association, which regulates the Eurobond market, warned that the EC 'is likely to have insufficient staff with high level experience of working in the industry'. The plan for a committee should be 'discussed more openly' before being carried through. The report also argues that Europe does not need a single securities exchange to achieve a single securities market, but a common regulatory approach; Towards a Single European Securities Trading Market, ISMA, London.

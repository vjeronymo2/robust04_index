Yeltsin first visited the FIS headquarters in Yasenevo on  December 26, 1991. At that time his meeting with the leading  personnel of the FIS was marked by an official confirmation of  academician Yevgeniy Primakov, Dr. of Science (Economics), as  the FIS chief, and a call "to tackle more actively the  accomplishment of current tasks".    The FIS was established by a presidential decree dated  December 18, 1991. It is the successor to the former first  directorate of the Soviet Union's KGB and the Central  Intelligence Service of the USSR (from November to December  1991).</p>

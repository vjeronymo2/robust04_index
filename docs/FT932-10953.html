			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Flotations ahead in first quarter FOR THE first quarter of this year the number of companies floating on the Stock Exchange rose from 12 to 16. KPMG Corporate Finance estimated that 1993 as a whole should see more than 90 new issues. That would be a return to the 1991 level after a total of 70 last year. Mr Neil Austin, head of new issues at KPMG, said there were a great deal more companies currently interested in flotation than at the same time last year. For some companies flotation was, however, an inappropriate method of funding growth as recovery takes root. 'There is a gap between development capital, which has an important part to play, and a full flot-ation.' 'It must be hoped that the continuing discussions on a second market can produce a viable middle option, ' he said.</p>

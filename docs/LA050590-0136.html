			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'TURTLES,' 'PRETTY WOMAN' FACE OFF IN LIGHTHEARTED AD BATTLE  </P> <P> You could almost call it "Ad Wars," "The Turtles Strike Back" or "Revenge of  Pretty Woman."  </P> <P> The ad campaigns for the two hit films "Pretty Woman" and "Teenage Mutant Ninja  Turtles" have become almost as fierce as their see-sawing battle for first  place at the box office each week.  </P> <P> There's no doubt though that "Turtles" has the lead with a cumulative gross of  $98 million to "Woman's" $81.3 million.  </P> <P> First there was the "Turtles" ad parody. Distributor New Line Cinema's ads  mocked "Pretty Woman" by having one of the turtles and one of the human stars,  Judith Hoag, pose like Richard Gere and Julia Roberts did in ads for the  Disney/Touchstone release. The "Turtles" ad line stated: "America's No. 1  Comedy Hit is Pretty Turtle-rific!"  </P> <P> But that was last week. The Gere-Roberts romantic comedy overtook the hip  tortoises this week as the No. 1 film, after trailing the "Turtles" the  previous four weeks. Prior to that, "Pretty Woman" had been No. 1 for one week.  </P> <P> Disney/Touchstone unveiled its lastest zinger Friday. It suspiciously resembles  an ad for none other than "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" and reads: "America's  No. 1 Hit Is Putting The Turtles Back In Their Place."  </P> <P> Touchstone wouldn't comment on its ad, but New Line is thrilled with it.  </P> <P> "We accept Disney as having a great sense of humor," said Sandra J. Ruch,  president of marketing for New Line. "It's flattering to us. I think that  Disney took what we did in the right way and returned the favor. We are having  a great giggle."  </P></p>

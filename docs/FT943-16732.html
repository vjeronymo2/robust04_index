			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: New issues Exco, the money-broking arm of the collapsed British &amp; Commonwealth group, has launched its return to the stock market after a seven-year absence with a share offer which values the company at Pounds 215.5m, writes Simon Davies. The public is being offered 13.3m shares at a price of 175p, while a further 39.8m shares have been placed with institutions already. Exco, one of the four major global money-broking businesses, is emerging from a troubled period under the unsteady guidance of a parent in receivership. The receivers are selling their remaining 40 per cent holding. The company has an even profits split between money-broking and fixed income securities broking, and it has lowered its exposure to individually volatile markets through a policy of global diversification. The shares have been issued on an historic price-earnings ratio of 9.5 and a notional gross yield of 6 per cent, reflecting the apprehension of volatility attached to the sector. But Exco's recent record of growth is expected to continue, with interim profits forecast to rise 28 per cent to Pounds 27.5m. The offer closes on Friday, July 8, and trading will start on July 19. This issue is sponsored by NM Rothschild, and the stockbroker is Kleinwort Benson Securities.</p>

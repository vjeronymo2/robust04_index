			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- Japan's exiting industrial  and economic planning chiefs called Monday for the new  government to carry on with deregulation and consumer-based  reforms.    After a morning cabinet meeting in which Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa's cabinet resigned en masse, Hiroshi Kumagai,  head of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI),  said the survival of Japan's economy depends on further  deregulation.    "Japan has taken only the first step in its deregulation  efforts," Kumagai said. "The fire for reforms built up by Mr.  Hosokawa should not be extinguished."    Manae Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning  Agency (EPA), urged the new government, to be headed by outgoing  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, to put priority on consumers.  She said that while promoting deregulation and other reforms,  the new government should focus on such issues as seeing that  the benefits of the high yen are passed on to consumers and  repeated that income tax cuts to stimulate the economy should  precede an offsetting hike in such indirect levies as the  consumption tax.    Political sources speculated that Kumagai will keep his post  as MITI minister under Hata. Kubota said she had heard nothing  of her own prospects.    On trade issues, Kumagai hinted at perplexity on new U.S.  proposals to restart stalled bilateral "framework" talks, saying  Washington's approach should be "a bit clearer."    Contents have not been disclosed of the U.S. proposal Hata  received as foreign minister April 15 from trade representative  Mickey Kantor at a global trade meeting in Marrakech, Morocco.  The United States and Japan have "fundamentally different  interpretations" of the framework objectives, a senior MITI  official said last week, adding Japan will respond to the U.S.  proposal after next week's string of national holidays.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Jin Yan (7246 1484)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 1 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Yunnan  Province has achieved remarkable results in banning drug abuse  and rehabilitating drug addicts. The total number of drug  addicts in Yunnan dropped from 57,000 in 1990 to 40,000 last  year.    Data provided by departments of the Ministry of Public  Security show that Yunnan Province, which is near drug sources  across the border, is one of the areas where drug abuse is most  serious in China. In recent years, while carrying out  well-planned investigation and sternly cracking down on drug  criminals, Yunnan Province has done solid work to strengthen the  banning of drug abuse and the rehabilitation of drug addicts.  Growth in the number of new drug addicts has been curbed, and  has dropped from 10,000 new drug addicts each year before 1990,  to about 2,000 each year in the past three years. The  percentage of new drug addicts among the total number of drug  addicts has also dropped from about one-sixth in the past, to  about one-twentieth at present.    Through experiments in banning drug abuse and rehabilitating  drug addicts over the past 10 years, Yunnan Province has  gradually formed an effective system for rehabilitating drug  addicts which tallies with local conditions. Since 1990, Yunnan  has helped over 20,000 drug addicts to rehabilitate themselves  each year and has summed up and spread successful experience in  preventing them from becoming drug addicts again. The rate of  success in rehabilitating drug addicts is about 10 percent.    Over the past two years, governments at various levels in  Yunnan Province have allocated more than 16 million yuan for  building 28 permanent centers for rehabilitating drug addicts by  compulsory means. The "Rules for Running Centers for  Rehabilitating Drug Addicts by Compulsory Means in Yunnan  Province" have also come into force.</p>

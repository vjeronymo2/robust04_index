			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs force leasehold concessions AN ALLIANCE of Tory and opposition MPs has won concessions from ministers dealing with the plans for leasehold reform. They have been forced into a review of the low-rent test which is one of the criteria for whether leaseholders qualify for the right to buy the freehold of the property. The move came in the detailed committee discussion of the housing and urban regeneration bill yesterday as four Tory backbenchers spoke out against the low-rent rule. Mr Tony Baldry, the junior housing minister, promised that the government would look again at the need for it. The MPs argued that the rule was 'artificial and unnecessary'. It dealt with a non-existent problem because the vast majority of long leaseholds were at a low rent. They said that keeping any low-rent test, even if the level of the qualifying rent were changed, would merely make work for lawyers. In response to moves led by Mr Dudley Fishburn, Tory MP for Kensington, ministers also agreed to review the draft rule that tenants would not qualify if more than 10 per cent of the property was in non-residential use, for example, in the case of a block of flats above a shop. The impression from the Department of the Environment is that the government is more prepared to see the low-rent rule go than it is to change the 10 per cent limit. Ministers say that the purpose of the low-rent rule is to distinguish between long leases where the tenant pays a premium at the beginning and then pays a low ground rent, and the different sort of interest held by a tenant who is on a long lease but paying a market rent. Only properties with a low rent qualify under current plans. However, they accept there is some evidence that the rule has been used to try to thwart the intentions of the bill, and may well concede the point. On the 10 per cent limit on commercial use, ministers point out that if the commercial element is much more than that, the costs to tenants in the property of buying it might well be so high that they would be reluctant to proceed. As the bill gives the leaseholders in properties that do not qualify an alternative and individual right to extend their leases for a 90-year term at a nominal rent, the government argues that the sort of change envisaged might mean that tenants are given a right they are unlikely to exercise, while being deprived of one that might be of more benefit. Labour thus believes that Mr Fishburn has lost his chance to ensure the change by accepting the commitment to a review rather than by voting with the opposition. On the other side of the argument, the government accepted a change proposed by Mr Peter Ainsworth, Tory MP for Surrey East, to protect landlords from speculators who acquire several leases.</p>

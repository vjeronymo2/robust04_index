			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> However, this rule should not be construed to foreclose the Agency's right to enjoin certain activities which threaten to compromise the values for which the HCNRA was established. Whether such action is warranted would need to be decided on a case-by-case basis. In the event that a nuisance-like activity should arise in the future which threatens the HCNRA, the Forest Service would be fully authorized to exercise its prerogative as a landowner to seek to get the activity terminated or modified so as to eliminate the deleterious effects on National Forest System lands. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: Snake River water rights.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One reviewer suggested that the rule should address withdrawals and diversions of water from the Snake River that are used for irrigating traditional farming and ranching activities in and around the HCNRA. This reviewer urged that the rule prescribe: how much water can be diverted, the time and purpose of diversion, and whether the diversion should be phased out so water may be retained in the Snake River. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The use of water from the Snake River is an integral component of many of the traditional farming and ranching operations occurring in the HCNRA. While the reviewer's concern may be legitimate and this rule would present an appropriate vehicle to address these concerns, Section 6 of the Act expressly prohibits the incorporation of these suggestions into this rule as follows: No provision of this Act, nor any regulations issued hereunder, shall in any way limit, restrict, or conflict with present and future uses of the waters of the Snake River and its tributaries upstream from the boundaries of the [HCNRA] created hereby, for beneficial uses, whether consumptive or nonconsumptive, now or hereafter existing, including, but not limited to, domestic, municipal, stockwater, irrigation, mining, power, or industrial uses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: Access to private land.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One reviewer stated that access is an integral part of the traditional uses recognized under the HCNRA Act and should not be arbitrarily limited since such limitations would reduce property value and restrict traditional uses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While the reviewer did not make clear how the proposed rule would limit access to private lands, nor did the reviewer offer suggestions for addressing the access issue, the Department notes that the proposed rule was silent on the issue of access and nowhere can it be inferred that the rule would permit the Forest Service to arbitrarily limit such access. The Department does not believe that this rule needs to address access, since section 1323 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) requires that access be granted to nonfederally owned lands located within the National Forest System. Agency rules at 36 CFR part 254, subpart E implement section 1323 and already apply to private lands within the HCNRA which are subject to the terms and conditions for reasonable ingress and egress that may be imposed by the Forest Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: Monitoring.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One reviewer noted that the proposed rule failed to establish a system whereby the use and development of private land in the HCNRA could be monitored by the Forest Service to detect violations. According to this reviewer, the rule is ``grossly deficient, and contrary to law in this respect.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While there was no provision for monitoring in the proposed rule, this rule is not somehow legally insufficient as a result. Monitoring by the Forest Service can occur in a number of ways and need not be expressly provided for or authorized in this rule. For instance, monitoring can occur by reviewing the actions of the local government regarding private land use and development issues. The Forest Service also can and does monitor private land use and development through routine aerial photographs for fire prevention and control, forest pest management, and landscape planning and management and on-the-ground observations from adjacent National Forest land. Additionally, where the Forest Service receives permission from the landowner, monitoring could also be accomplished via an on-site investigation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the proposed rule, monitoring also would be accomplished through the compliance determination process which is optional on the part of the landowner. Although the Department believes that monitoring was never eliminated from the Forest Service's responsibilities by the proposed rule, it also believes that monitoring is so important that it would like to make clear that the Forest Service may monitor the uses and developments on private lands at any time it believes it has good reason to be concerned about the protection of the values for which the HCNRA was established. To emphasize this point, the final rule adds a new standard in &sect;292.24, paragraph (b)(2) which states that the Forest Service may initiate the compliance process on its own without having first received a landowner request. This standard clearly shows that the Forest Service may initiate the determination of compliance process, where the agency has reason to believe, based on monitoring or other information, that the landowner may be violating the standards for private land use and development established by this rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Specific Comments on Proposed Subpart E of 36 CFR Part 292 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following is a discussion of comments that were received pertaining to specific sections of the proposed rule and the changes, if any, resulting from the comments. No comments were received on &sect;292.20, Purpose and Scope, or on &sect;292.25, Information Requirements, and no substantive modifications have been made to the text of these sections, although editing for improved readability and word choice was made. Accordingly, neither section is set out for further discussion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 292.21&blank;Definitions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section listed and defined special terms used in this subpart. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: ``Farm/forest/grazing lands.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two reviewers suggested that the definition of ``farm/forest/grazing lands'' be modified to eliminate references to watershed protection, fish &amp; wildlife habitat maintenance and recreational activities as purposes for which farm/forest/grazing lands may be used. These reviewers felt that these additional non-farming uses could pose burdensome and expensive requirements on the management of farming or grazing operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The reviewers' concern that this definition would result in the imposition of additional requirements on their operations is unfounded. The subject definition is set out in the disjunctive. In other words, farm/forest/grazing lands may be used for farm/forest/grazing purposes or for watershed purposes, or for fish &amp; wildlife purposes, or for recreational purposes, or for a combination of the above. The inclusion of these terms in this definition does not imply that new requirements would be incorporated into ongoing farming and ranching operations in the HCNRA. Of course, these farming and ranching operations are still subject to applicable federal, state, and local laws and ordinances. Therefore, the definition is adopted without change from the proposed rule. However, on consideration of the comments on the term ``farm/forest/grazing lands,'' the Department has determined that the definition of ``farm/forest/grazing uses'' should be modified so that it more closely parallels the definition of ``farm/forest/grazing lands.'' To that end, a new second sentence has been included in the ``farm/forest/grazing use'' definition which recognizes that uses related to watershed protection, fish and wildlife habitat maintenance, and recreational activities may also be undertaken on these lands. Again, because these activities may be undertaken does not signify that they must be undertaken. The definition of ``farm/forest/grazing use'' also has been rearranged for ease of reading and comprehension. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: ``Land modification.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One reviewer noted that the definition of ``land modification'' in the proposed rule included road construction as an example but that the circumstances under which road construction would be accommodated in conjunction with access needs for the purpose of maintaining and constructing utility facilities were unclear. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

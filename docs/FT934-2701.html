			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / EU Summit: EU issues a pledge it hopes never to redeem - The potentially heavy price for a Gatt accord The European Union issued a promissory note to French farmers at the summit to get France to sign up to the Uruguay Round world trade deal now within reach. But it is far from certain that the EU will have the resources to redeem this pledge if the note is ever presented for payment. At the same time, the 12 heads of government issued negotiating guidelines on textiles, cinema and broadcasting, and future multilateral trade rules and weapons, which could complicate efforts to conclude the Gatt talks in Geneva. EU foreign ministers start what could turn into a week-long meeting today to try to put flesh on the bones of the summit's Gatt guidelines, which Sir Leon Brittan, the chief EU trade negotiator, will also have to factor in to his tactics in Geneva. The French hard line encouraged countries like Spain, Portugal, Greece, Ireland and Belgium to come forward with their own last-minute lists of demands that had to be satisfied either within the Gatt negotiations, or to offset damage to national interests if a deal is reached. The summit conclusions described textiles as 'of vital importance to one member state', in implicit reference to Portuguese threats to veto Gatt unless the US offers more market access for textiles, or the EU helps Portugal restructure its textiles sector. The conclusions also require an agreement which 'guarantees special and separate treatment of audiovisual matters both now and in the future'. France, with strong backing from countries such as Spain and Belgium, wants cinema and broadcasting kept out of Gatt altogether to guard against further cultural 'invasion' from the US. Greek objections to US protectionism in ocean shipping probably mean that maritime transport will now be taken out of the Geneva negotiations, Brussels officials say. The French and Spanish demand for tougher trade defence mechanisms to put up against US Section 301 legislation will be looked at by the foreign ministers on the basis of a plausible compromise drafted at the summit. On agriculture, France demanded a guarantee that farmers would not have to 'set aside,' or take out of production, any more land if the output forecasts of the reformed common agricultural policy push the exportable agricultural surplus above Gatt limits on subsidised food exports. In practice, that would mean cutting prices to world market levels so the EU could export without subsidy. Farmers would then get direct compensation for the cuts which would cost the EU budget Ecu2bn (Pounds 1.52bn) for every Ecu10 by which the world price target had been missed. A joint Franco-German text spelled all but the cost of this out, and in addition, offered German farmers guarantees their incomes would not be affected by any further revaluation of the D-Mark, as well as letting east German farmers off part of the penalty for exceeding by 10 per cent the area they are allowed to plant. In the event, France got the more ambiguous commitment that if the CAP forecasts and Gatt limits collide, this would 'not increase the restraints of the reformed CAP'. The EU 'would, if necessary, take the requisite steps while respecting the decisions of the Edinburgh European Council' last December, which put a ceiling on EU farm and budgetary expenditure. The German demands, which could prove even more costly than France's, have been left for further wrangling. Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, who has to sell a Gatt deal to parliament this week, acknowledged that the set-aside guarantee was implicit, but insisted that 'it is agreed that what needs to be done will be done'. Mr John Major, UK prime minister, chose to emphasise 'there will be no change to the own resources (EU budget) limit and that has been agreed'. Do these commitments add up? A Gatt agreement will not start until 1995, and whether CAP output forecasts are accurate will not be known until 1996. The revised Blair House EU-US accord on farm trade pushes part of the Gatt cuts towards the end of its six-year timetable. So nothing should have to be done until around 1997, and only then if production projections are wrong. But by then, the EU budget, which moves up in line with combined gross domestic product, should have more resources, assuming growth resumes. But if Germany eventually gets the 'green' D-mark formula it wants - the costly 'switchover' mechanism which raises farm prices in all countries in line with the strongest revaluing currencies - such calculations could be worthless, and the promissory note will fall due.</p>

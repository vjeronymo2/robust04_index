			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Lev Ambinder report: "News Conference of Russia's Armorers </F> Union. Arms Producers Start Making Laws"]    [Excerpts] Russian small-arms exporters, seriously  concerned at the threats of a number of European states to take  measures in connection with the imminent 100-percent hike in  July in customs duties on arms imports to Russia, are looking  for a compromise. Oleg Kuzmenko, executive director of the Union  of Russian Armorers, advised at the news conference that took  place in Izhevsk yesterday that draft decrees are being prepared  jointly with the State Committee on the Defense Industry and the  government of Udmurtia, suggesting that these duties be brought  into line with those of the rest of the world, and at the same  time the price of licenses for trade in weapons be increased.  [passage omitted]    Since the former legal norms regulating the purchasing,  keeping, trade in and manufacture of sporting and hunting arms  have been abolished, and new ones have not been put in place  yet, the next draft law proposed by the armorers relates  precisely to these matters. In particular, it sets the price of  a license for trade in weapons at 400 minimal salaries, that of  a buyer's license at 0.5 percent of the minimum salary, that of  a license for keeping a weapon at 0.04 percent, and that of the  license for the production of weapons at 0.1 percent of the  minimum salary.    That puts some constraints on traders in imported weapons on  the home market. Mr. Kuzmenko is confident that following the  conference in Izhevsk chaired by Oleg Soskovets, first deputy  prime minister of the Russian Government, who supported the  armorers' proposals, they could be adopted by the Russian  Government as early as this month.    KOMMERSANT-DAILY observers point out that the position of  Russian armorers has been significantly determined by their  success in March at the international fire-arms show at  Nuremberg where some of the articles fetched preliminary orders  for twice the quantities than the producers could supply. In  this connection the alluring prospect of stepping up their arms  export made the armorers speak against the introduction of high  customs duties.</p>

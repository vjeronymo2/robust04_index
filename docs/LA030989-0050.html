			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> DONALD CROCKETT LEADS MUSIC ENSEMBLE AT USC  </P> <P> The fruits of hard work were on display when Donald Crockett conducted USC's  Contemporary Music Ensemble Tuesday night at Hancock Auditorium, USC. An  appreciative audience was rewarded with an intelligent, varied program of four  works, all given superb attention by the student chamber orchestra.  </P> <P> The centerpiece of the evening, Aaron Kernis' "America(n) (Day) Dreams" (1984),  was a Post-Modern setting of six stream-of-consciousness poems by May Swenson.  Written for amplified voice and chamber ensemble, Kernis' dreamlike work  unfolded mysteriously through a variety of styles which included a subtle quote  of the Herman's Hermits song "There's a Kind of Hush" and an epilogue in the  style of a 1930s American dance band.  </P> <P> Crockett led his forces with the right amount of wit, carefully placing every  note and shaping each phrase. Mezzo Karen Born provided adequate singing,  narration and Sprechgesang, beginning timidly, but eventually gaining more  confidence.  </P> <P> In Gilbert Amy's serial "Echos XIII" (1976) for horn, trombone, harp, piano and  chamber ensemble, Crockett and the four soloists painstakingly brought out tiny  melodic fragments in a Baroque concerto form -- frenetic solo sections  alternating with equally busy tutti interludes. Trombonist Mark Ammons supplied  the most gusto, accurately mastering difficult, multifarious effects and quick  passages.  </P> <P> Completing the program were two British works: Benjamin Britten's Second Suite  for Cello (1967), with cellist Philip Hansen demonstrating his admirable  virtuosity, and Oliver Knussen's "Ophelia Dances 1" (1975) for chamber  ensemble, a somewhat reserved but carefully wrought study on the madness of  Ophelia in Shakespeare's "Hamlet."

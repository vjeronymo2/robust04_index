			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Brent Walker to unveil Pounds 1bn write-down BRENT WALKER, the heavily-borrowed UK leisure group, is expected to disclose a write-down in the value of property and assets from Pounds 1.1bn, net of debt, to about Pounds 100m when it announces its preliminary results for 1990 on Wednesday. The disastrous figures have prompted some of the group's bankers, which are collectively owed Pounds 1.4bn by Brent Walker, to talk privately of ousting Mr George Walker, the chairman and chief executive, who engineered the group's rapid rise in the 1980s. But, according to a source close to the company, neither Mr Walker nor other Brent Walker directors had heard from any bankers and the chairman had 'no intention of stepping down'. Mr Walker and Hill Samuel, the merchant bank, are planning to present proposals for a financial restructuring to bankers, led by Standard Chartered, after the preliminary results are announced. It is understood that Brent Walker will propose to cut debt to almost Pounds 1bn by the year-end with asset sales. This could lead to the sale of the Brighton marina, the Puerto Sherry marina in Spain, a 50 per cent share in London's Trocadero, the retail, leisure and office complex, and hotels and casinos. The refinancing plan is also expected to propose that Brent Walker retains the pub retailing division and William Hill, the profitable betting shop chain it bought for Pounds 685m from Grand Metropolitan in 1989. However, the banks are believed to be anxious about Mr Walker's desire to keep William Hill. The chain is one of Brent Walker's most saleable assets. Last autumn, the Bank of England was widely thought to have urged restraint on Brent Walker's more hawkish bankers, amid an uncertain economic atmosphere. The Bank is being kept informed of negotiations. The banks demanded a financial restructuring as a condition of their agreement last November, which froze capital repayments until the end of this year. Brent Walker's 1990 assets will exclude the Pounds 160m which it says it is owed by Grand Metropolitan as a partial refund on the purchase price of William Hill. Brent Walker demanded the refund because it said the chain's profits were not as high as GrandMet had stated. It withheld payment of a final Pounds 50m instalment on the purchase price until the dispute over the Pounds 160m could be settled by arbitration. In January, the High Court ruled that Brent Walker should pay the Pounds 50m. It has not yet paid.</p>

By the  same token, however, it would be "dangerous" for Japan to adopt  a business-as-usual approach in its relations with the United  States, Owada said in an address at a Tokyo hotel.    Owada issued the note of caution at a gathering organized by  the International Friendship Exchange Committee (FEC), a private  nonprofit organization. "It would not be good to either panic  or be optimistic, but the worst thing would be to begin acting  on emotion," he said.    Owada blasted what he said was "sensational" media reporting  about the February 11 meeting that has given a "mistaken"  impression that bilateral relations are "heading toward a  crisis" and that a new round of "Japan-bashing" has started in  the United States. He said that in dealing with the U.S., Japan  must bear in mind that the Clinton administration came to power  on a wave of popular sentiment that the new government would  focus on domestic woes, especially the country's ailing economy.    Owada expressed concern that with economic issues at the  forefront of U.S. policy, government officials in Washington are  finding it increasingly difficult to consider ties with Japan in  a "comprehensive" manner, encompassing bilateral cooperation in  the political and security fields. He suggested that their  search for an effective way of dealing with the bilateral trade  dispute, different from unproductive approaches of the past, has  given rise to the idea of using the political and security  cooperation as a kind of leverage over economic issues.    Owada, who is the father of Crown Princess Masako, also took  issue with Clinton's recent remarks that none of the 30 or so  agreements concluded between Japan and the U.S. is functioning  satisfactorily. "In actuality, this is not the case," he said,  calling it an example of a "great misunderstanding."</p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / US Mid-Term Elections: Big Apple fails to save political giant New York city turned out in force on Tuesday to vote for Mr Mario Cuomo, the state's governor for the past 12 years and a giant on the national political stage. The trouble for city dwellers was, the rest of the state did not. The narrow vote which ousted the 62-year-old Mr Cuomo, installing in his place Mr George Pataki, a little-known Republican, revealed a starker division between voters in the city and those in the suburbs and up-state New York than at any of the previous three elections, all of which Mr Cuomo won. It also threatens to usher in a turbulent period in relations between state and city in New York - and a degree of animosity that could turn the city's current budgetary problems into a bigger headache. The reasons for Mr Cuomo's defeat are not difficult to identify. 'The New York economy has dramatically lagged behind the national recovery,' says Mr David Schulman, an economist at Salomon Brothers in Manhattan. 'And Cuomo has been around too long.' The second consideration was probably the strongest in bringing to a halt one of the most prominent liberal Democratic political careers in the US. Mr Cuomo's accomplished oratory and political skills finally wore thin with an electorate which has failed to see clear signs of improvement after the last recession. Mr Cuomo twice came close to seeking the Democratic nomination for president, most recently in 1992. He was also offered, but turned down, a seat on the US Supreme Court last year. Mr Pataki, meanwhile, benefited from not being Mr Cuomo. A former mayor of the small town of Peekskill, he is less well known than his political godfather, Senator Alfonse D'Amato. The New York Republican senator single-handedly pulled Mr Pataki from obscurity when he threw his weight behind the state senator earlier this year. Otherwise, the new governor has preached a bland and generally vague mix of policies during his campaign. He has pledged to champion the reintroduction of the death penalty in New York, build more prisons and reduce taxes. As a tax-cutting Roman Catholic from the prosperous Westchester suburbs, Mr Pataki is not the sort of person most likely to appeal to city dwellers. Adding to the city's anxiety was the decision by its Republican mayor, Mr Rudolph Giuliani, two weeks ago to cross party lines and back Mr Cuomo's campaign. Mr Giuliani and Mr D'Amato are old rivals. The question now is whether Mr Pataki and his political mentor will take their revenge. Mr Lewis Lehrman, a New York businessman who ran against Mr Cuomo in an earlier gubernatorial election, says that the city could suffer from Mr Giuliani's endorsement. 'New York city has been subsidised by the taxpayers of upstate New York for generations. While that will not entirely be reversed, growth of those subsidies should end.' At the very least, it will make life difficult for Mr Giuliani as he grapples with a budget deficit that is expected to top Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) in each of the next two years. 'It's likely to make the city's budgetary problems more difficult to deal with,' says Mr Felix Rohatyn, a senior partner at Lazard Freres. Around two thirds of the state's budget goes to local governments in the form of aid, roughly half to New York city. If Mr Pataki pushes ahead and cuts the state's top income tax rate, says Mr Rohatyn, it will add Dollars 500m a year to the city's deficit. 'It could be detrimental to its businesses, and drive more people away from the city,' he says.</p>

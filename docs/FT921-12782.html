			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Lobbyists fight shy of Strasbourg register THE European Parliament is considering a code of conduct for the estimated 3,000 professional lobbyists who have established themselves in Brussels to influence Community laws and decisions. This move parallels a similar step by the European Commission, whose 1992 work programme, to be unveiled next month, also talks of the need for a proper code of conduct between the Commission and pressure groups. For all their mock horror at the growth in Euro-lobbying, most EC legislators and officials are privately delighted that so many people now consider them worth influencing. But as the stakes mount, so does industry pressure, with, for instance, the tobacco lobby now pulling out all the stops to head off a near-total ban on tobacco advertising. Two days of public hearings this week gave professional lobbyists the unusual chance to lobby in favour of themselves rather than their clients. Most of them baulked at having to register as lobbyists, as they are required to do in the US and Germany.</p>

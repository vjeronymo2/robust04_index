			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Lloyd's trusts press on with capital raising THE SPONSORS of two of the biggest investment trusts at the Lloyd's of London insurance market will today press ahead with plans to raise some Pounds 400m in corporate capital, despite setbacks to smaller schemes in the last few days. Backers of the larger schemes, sponsored by Samuel Montagu and Barclays de Zoete Wedd, will issue prospectuses today and are confident about raising capital from a range of institutions, including pension funds and life assurance companies, as well as retail investors. Successful launches will bolster confidence in Lloyd's corporate capital initiative, following yesterday's decision by Johnson Fry, the financial services company, to scrap its Pounds 50m Corporate Insurance Recovery Trust, which offered retail investors participation in a range of Lloyd's funds. Johnson Fry blamed the 'limited time frame'. The trust raised Pounds 8m out of its minimum subscription level of Pounds 15m. London Insurance Market Investment Trust (Limit), sponsored by Samuel Montagu and James Capel, will be the biggest of more than a dozen investment trusts and companies seeking to raise at least Pounds 1.3bn for Lloyd's. Names - the individuals who have traditionally supported the market's capital base - approved plans to invite new corporate members last month. Limit is aiming to raise Pounds 280m from about 60 institutions and retail investors for a fund which will allow 98 syndicates to underwrite up to Pounds 480m in premium income. 'We wouldn't be doing this if we were not certain that we were going to find placees,' said Sir Laurie Magnus, a director of Montagu. The CLM Insurance Fund, sponsored by BZW and backed by a subsidiary of Sedgwick Group, the insurance broker, has scaled back its capital raising target from Pounds 200m to between Pounds 100m and Pounds 120m. This was mainly because of difficulties in securing sufficient 'good quality' capacity on Lloyd's syndicates, said Mr Michael Wade, CLM chief executive. Like Limit, CLM will also target retail investors, including opening a 'share shop' in the Lloyd's building. Johnson Fry's scheme was focused exclusively on the retail market. Mr Charles Fry, chief executive of Johnson Fry, said that demand from private investors 'is certainly there' and that 'with a longer subscription period, we would have reached our targets.' Two other Lloyd's agencies - Sturge Holdings and London Wall - have abandoned plans to develop trusts with stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson and Beeson Gregory respectively, mainly because anticipated shortages of capacity have not materialised. Last week another fund, HCG Lloyd's Investment Trust, scaled back its capital raising efforts after institutions did not respond as well as expected. Nevertheless HCG still raised Pounds 65m and two other funds - Hiscox Select Insurance Fund and Finsbury Underwriting Investment Trust - experienced no difficulty in each raising Pounds 30m. Six more trusts plan to issue prospectuses in the next two weeks, aiming to raise capital through private placements and offers for sale via intermediaries.</p>

			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Ofwat urges water companies to plug leaks OFWAT, the water industry regulator, yesterday urged water companies to plug leaks in mains and install more meters rather than build expensive new reservoirs to meet growing demand for water. Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat's director-general, said meters had been installed in only 5 per cent of households. But he warned that some metered customers had been charged too much. Ofwat says the steps being taken by water companies to meet the growing new demand for water will account for a quarter of the rise in water bills above the rate of inflation between 1990 and 1995. Yesterday's report by Ofwat is the last in a series of consultation papers leading up to next year's periodic review, at which the regulator will reassess the basis for annual price rises for the first time since the 1989 privatisation. Wide differences between the companies and the regulator have emerged on the question of how customers should pay for improvements. Ms Janet Langdon, director of the Water Services Association - which represents the 10 large water and sewerage companies - said yesterday: 'We don't think it's yet clear that metering reduces demand - it is premature to conclude that ahead of the results of trials by the Department of the Environment and the companies.' She added: 'We have a statutory duty to supply water, and if it suddenly ran out there would be the most fantastic row.' Mr David Luffrum, finance director of Thames Water - which is considering building a large reservoir near Abingdon, Oxon - said: 'We believe in metering where it makes sense and leakage reduction where it is cost-effective, but we don't believe that on their own these will be sufficient, and a reservoir may be needed.' According to Ofwat, average water bills for metered households in some regions were between Pounds 12 and Pounds 60 a year higher than for unmetered households, and sewerage bills were between Pounds 8 and Pounds 73 higher. Mr Alan Jones, finance director of Northumbrian Water, said: 'You can take many different views on how to calculate these figures - they include assumptions about how much water the average customer consumes which we are discussing with Ofwat'. The regulator says Northumbrian has the biggest gap between metered and unmetered charges. Mr Byatt said the 'infrastructure charge' levied on new domestic customers when they were connected to the system was 'too high' and varied between companies to an extent which 'cannot be properly justified'. The report says new properties in Eastbourne, East Sussex, pay Pounds 1,154 compared with Pounds 394 in Hastings. Editorial comment, Page 19</p>

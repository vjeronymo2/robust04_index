			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Indonesia (4): Exporter will join the importers - Energy shortages loom for an oil-rich country oil, gas, coal and geothermal and hydroelectric power - but the country faces some hard decisions about where to invest the billions of dollars that will be needed to provide more fuel for its economic development in the next century. Oil exports have financed Indonesia's rapid industrialisation since the 1960s, and Indonesia has been a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries since 1962. But within the next 10 years or so Indonesia is likely to become a net importer of oil as domestic consumption grows and production falls. Latest projections from the central bank in Jakarta show the net current account contribution of oil dropping to Dollars 930m in the 1993/94 financial year from Dollars 2.19bn in 1992/93. Oil output last year fell to about 1.5m barrels a day, six per cent below the level in 1991. In recent years there has been plenty of exploration by the scores of oil companies operating in Indonesia, but few substantial discoveries. Whereas the first wave of contracts awarded in the 1960s and 1970s proved to be remarkably successful - about a dozen out of 55 are still estimated to be profitably producing today - the more recent results have been miserable; of more than 130 contracts agreed since 1976, only one is thought to be both producing and making a profit. 'Clearly the industry has been spectacularly unsuccessful over the last 18 years,' said an oil company executive. It is rare in any oil-producing country to find a foreign oil company which would be so rash as to declare itself satisfied with the profit-sharing conditions of the host government, but there does appear to be a genuine concern about the high costs and low rewards of operating in Indonesia - a concern acknowledged by the government's decision to improve incentives three times in the last five years. The latest round of incentives announced in September last year were aimed principally at encouraging companies to look for gas and to explore for hydrocarbons in deep water and in remote areas, but the response from the oil companies has been unenthusiastic. A few companies closed their offices in Indonesia last year or reduced staff, and others are looking with renewed interest at other prospects in Vietnam, China, India, the Philippines and the former Soviet Union. Existing oil producers want Indonesia to scrap its 'ring-fencing' of production sharing contracts, a change which would allow them to offset costs in new exploration areas against their earnings but would also unfairly disadvantage oil companies without any current production in Indonesia. For Indonesia, the benefits of such a step - which the authorities have shown no sign of taking - would be to promote the search for oil and gas in eastern areas hitherto only thinly explored. With wells in remote, deep water areas costing up to Dollars 30m each, it is hardly surprising that about 80 per cent of exploration at present takes place in existing production areas, mostly in the west. Gas is as crucial as oil to the wellbeing of the Indonesian economy. The country is the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), shipping about Dollars 4bn worth a year to Japan and other countries, and the government is keen to promote domestic use of natural gas to reduce local demand for oil and so free more crude for export. The largest known deposit of gas in Indonesia - and south-east Asia - is the Natuna field in the south China sea. Its size presents both opportunities and problems. Pertamina, the state oil and gas company, and Exxon of the US have yet to finalise terms on developing the giant field, and even when they do they will face daunting technical and financial challenges before being able to make the first LNG shipments eight years later. Natuna, with an estimated 45 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, represents about half of Indonesia's known reserves. But 70 per cent of the corrosive mixture to be extracted from the wells is carbon dioxide, requiring costly separation and re-injection facilities and special corrosion resistant materials. About 700,000 tonnes of steel would be required for the offshore facilities, and the valves and fittings for the treatment platforms would be among the largest available. The total cost of the project is likely to be more than Dollars 16bn. The more mundane business of developing smaller gas deposits for domestic power stations and other consumers is less daunting, but not without its own obstacles; there are at least 79 known fields too small to be exploited for export. Oil companies are sometimes reluctant to admit they have found gas because they fear they will not be able to develop it profitably. The French company Total has made finds off Borneo, which may help to extend the life of Indonesian LNG exports, but some scattered gas deposits found elsewhere years ago have never been developed because they are too small for LNG and too far from domestic consumers to justify the construction of a pipeline. The Indonesian government is struggling to develop a coherent domestic gas distribution policy, but Pertamina is said to be unwilling to give up too much influence to Perum Gas Negara (PGN), the state gas distributor which is expected to develop gas transmission systems. Indonesia has complex bureaucracy as well as complex geology. 'It's becoming urgent because of the high demand,' said a senior PGN official. 'It's very urgent and I hope that this will be fully understood by all the bureaucrats in the government.' Some steps, however, have been taken. After more than a year's delay, a pipeline from an Arco-operated field off east Java is being built to supply a new power station at Gresik near Surabaya. Future projects may include pipelines from south Sumatra gas fields south to energy-hungry west Java and north to the huge Duri field operated by Caltex - to replace oil currently burned in making steam which is injected into the reservoir to heat and lift the heavy crude. Another strategy adopted to conserve oil has been to increase the domestic retail price of fuel - which had been below world prices. Most petroleum product prices were raised by more than 20 per cent in January, and although the authorities are concerned about the inflationary effects of the increase, further rises may follow in coming years to suppress growing demand and promote the use of gas. The man responsible for the sensitive task of directing energy policy is Gen IB Sudjana, who is said to have a background in army logistics and no experience of the oil and gas industry. He was appointed minister of mining and energy in the March cabinet reshuffle. 'It came as a surprise to a lot of people, probably including the minister himself,' said a leading Jakarta businessman. One energy source he can look to with confidence, both for domestic use and for exports, is coal. Production is rising fast following the welcome given to foreign investors in the 1980s. Indonesia has 32bn tonnes of coal and lignite reserves. Exports doubled last year to 15m tonnes. By 1995, Indonesia should be producing 35m tonnes, of which about 21m will be exported. This year, Indonesia is expected to overtake Colombia as the world's fourth largest coal exporter, behind Australia, South Africa and the US.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NON-OIL/GAS EXPORTS (DOLLARS BN)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DESTINATION       1988     1989      1990     1991     1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US                1.98      2.06     2.33     2.70     3.61 EC                2.08      2.40     3.20     3.82     4.59 Japan             2.69      3.64     3.27     3.68     3.

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / French greens gain on Socialists France's ecologists have almost caught up with the ruling Socialist party in public support, two months ahead of parliamentary elections, an opinion poll published yesterday showed, Reuter reports from Paris. The BVA poll for Paris-Match magazine put support for the United Ecologist list at 19 per cent, a gain of four percentage points in two weeks, while the Socialists stood at 19.5 per cent, as their slow erosion was continued. The ecologists draw much of their support from disillusioned Socialist voters. The centre-right alliance of the RPR and UDF slipped to 39 per cent from 41.5 per cent. The extreme-right National Front was credited with 11 per cent and the Communist Party with 8 per cent.</p>

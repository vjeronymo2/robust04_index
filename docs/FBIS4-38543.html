			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 27 TASS -- A representation to cancel the  regulations on privatization in Moscow, which were prepared on  the instruction of Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov and run counter to  the current legislation, has been made by Chairman of the  Russian State Property Committee Anatoliy Chubays to the Russian  procurator general's office.    "Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov has launched a campaign of  large-scale violations of privatization legislation and even  fully prohibited the transfer of state property into private in  the city," Chubays told correspondents.    In his words, the Moscow City Committee for Property  gradually stopped corporatization and sales of Moscow  enterprises at privatization voucher auctions. The share of  joint stock enterprises in Moscow amounted to 15 per cent from  the overall number of enterprises liable for corporatization in  April 1994, as compared to 62 per cent throughout Russia.  Moscow is lagging behind in privatization of large enterprises  as well.    The privatization situation in Moscow can be estimated as  catastrophic, said Chubays.</p>

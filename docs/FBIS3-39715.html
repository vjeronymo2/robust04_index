Russia's relations with the European Union [EU], the crisis  in Bosnia-Herzegovina and generally in the former Yugoslavia,  and the problems between Athens and Skopje were discussed today  at Zappion Palace during the talks between the EU troika and  Russia. The talks were attended by Greek Foreign Minister  Karolos Papoulias, German Foreign Minister Kinkel, Belgian  Foreign Minister Willy Claes, Hans van den Broek, EU  Commissioner for Foreign Affairs, and Russian Foreign Minister  Kozyrev. Regarding this meeting, our diplomatic correspondent  Mirella Kalostipi reports the following:    [Begin Kalostipi recording] Foreign Minister Papoulias  described the meeting between the EU troika and Russia as  productive, sincere, and warm. Since this morning, the foreign  ministers of Germany and Belgium, the EU commissioner for  foreign affairs, and the Greek foreign minister, who is  presiding over the EU Council of Foreign Ministers, have been  meeting with the Russian foreign minister on all the important  issues that Europe is facing. Naturally, the crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina was at the center of the talks. Both  Papoulias and Kozyrev expressed optimism that a peaceful  solution to the problem will prevail over a military one.    In a news conference immediately following the meeting, the  foreign ministers of Germany and Russia were asked about the  Greek measures against Skopje. Kinkel, as is known, opposed the  measures, saying they are unusual and not a way to solve  problems. He also expressed his country's interest in stability  in the area. The Russian foreign minister stressed that the  people in the south of Europe should contribute toward stability  in the Balkans. If there are states with territorial plans  against other countries, they should give them up and, like  Russia, Kozyrev said, respect the sovereignty and independence  of other peoples.

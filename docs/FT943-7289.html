			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Hard test at end of a crash course: After a decade of fast growth, the UK university system is examining its future This is even worse than doing the exams,' said Alison, a nervous school leaver from Sussex, yesterday. She was waiting for the listing today of UK university places that were not filled when last week's A-level results were unveiled. Her concern was understandable. After a decade in which the number of university places on offer has increased each year, this autumn the numbers admitted will be the same as in 1993. Having seen student numbers double since the early 1980s, UK universities are at last slamming on the brakes. Admissions tutors are limiting the number of entrants mainly because the government has given them no choice. Universities will be given less state funds per student if they allow the number they recruit to rise by more than 1 per cent this year - the first time in recent years that they have been penalised for growing too fast. Many universities object to the government's methods, which they consider unnecessarily heavy-handed. The Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals, which represents university heads, said the cap on admissions could mean a 'massive denial of opportunity' for students. They blame ministers for not anticipating how fast higher education would expand - and then overreacting when they realised they had miscalculated. When Mr Kenneth Baker, the then education secretary, announced in 1989 a push towards a system of 'mass higher education' he set a target of 30 per cent of 18 year-olds entering university by 2000. That target was passed last year. But there is a growing acceptance among universities that, even without government intervention, they would be best advised to consolidate for several years. To do otherwise, the committee has been warned by higher education experts, would risk exacerbating already serious funding problems and compromise quality. It would also run the risk of flooding the labour market with graduates. The number of universities has almost doubled since 1992 thanks mainly to the upgrading of polytechnics, which were previously funded by local education authorities. There are now 89 UK universities, 41 of which have gained that status since 1992. New universities have expanded fastest. De Montfort University, formerly Leicester Polytechnic, is the fastest-growing university in western Europe. In the 1986-87 academic year it had 8,000 students. By 1993-94 that figure was nearer 18,000 and by the end of this year should reach 25,000. Almost inevitably, growth on this scale has brought funding problems. The amount the government pays to universities per student (excluding maintenance grants) has dropped by more than 30 per cent since 1980 in real terms, and the government is looking for a further fall of 10 per cent over the next three years. Even in the longer term, a report by Professor Gareth Williams and Dr Heather Fry of London University's Institute of Education warns vice-chancellors not to expect any increase in government funding. They point to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development figures which show that UK state funding for education as a proportion of national income is higher per student than in any other western nation. The effects of reduced funding are already being felt in more crowded lecture halls. Five years ago there were 10.6 students to every lecturer; now there are 14, according to the Association of University Teachers. Meanwhile, claims the vice-chancellors' committee, higher education institutions have not been able to keep their buildings up to standard and need Pounds 1.35bn just to clear the maintenance backlog. The experience of Germany suggests that rapid expansion of higher education can jeopardise quality, as well as adding to financial pressures. German universities were once as exclusive as the UK system, catering for only 5 per cent of young Germans in the 1960s. Now the figure is 30 per cent. Of these, 40 per cent drop out within the first two or three years without qualifications. But about a third stay for more than seven years. That suggests the system has not been able to cope effectively and efficiently with the increase in numbers and is wasting resources. Some UK academics fear the reduction in state funding per student has already affected the country's academic standards. Earl Russell, a Liberal Democrat peer and history professor at London University, has argued that undergraduates, unless they have rich parents, are forced to work during term time and so spend less time on studies. He sparked controversy by adding that as a result: 'Academics, often unconsciously, have lowered their requirements for work to what their students are able to do, so that an Upper Second in 1992 may involve less work than a Lower Second in 1984.' Vice-chancellors deny that this has happened, but the proportion of students at 'old' universities (that is, excluding former polytechnics) being awarded first-class honours degrees has risen by 50 per cent over the past decade, even though a much larger proportion of the population is sitting degree examinations. That implies quality might have been diluted. The Institute of Education's report also warns that the increase in institutions awarding university degrees could affect quality: 'So far the system has been able to sustain the credibility of the doctrine that all degrees are formally equivalent if not exactly equal. At issue for the future is the extent to which this belief will remain convincing, and if not what will replace it.' The rapid expansion of higher education is not necessarily good news for students either, when they start looking for jobs. With twice as many graduates entering the job market each year, a degree cannot guarantee the same opportunities as a decade ago. According to the Institute's report, 'graduates will need to accept career patterns' which are 'markedly different from those of the past . . . It is not clear that most students have yet come to terms with this change in prospects.' Experience from the US, where the number of students graduating each year has trebled since 1961, suggests that employers will adjust recruitment practices accordingly. The Institute of Manpower Studies, based at Sussex University, found that after increasing steadily throughout the 1960s, US real starting salaries peaked in 1969 (at Dollars 25,288 in 1990 prices), and then dropped by 16 per cent over the next two decades, to Dollars 21,319 in 1990. Meanwhile the proportion of US graduates accepting jobs for which a degree was not a requirement rose from 11 per cent in 1969 to 20 per cent in 1990. This is projected to reach 30 per cent by 2005. Similar trends are already emerging in the UK. Graduate unemployment is at record levels, while starting salaries failed this year to keep pace with inflation for the first time since records began in 1980, according to the Higher Education Careers Services Unit. Traditional graduate recruiters, such as accountancy firms, continued to offer attractive salaries, according to Mr Colin Lawton, the unit's statistical assistant, but the average was being dragged down by smaller companies which had not recruited graduates before. By holding numbers constant this year, universities should be able to create a breathing space in which to address such problems. That will require examining the service they can offer in an increasingly 'mass-market' higher education system, and the trade off between quality and quantity when resources are limited. As Mr Baker observed in 1989: 'The structures appropriate to higher education with 3 per cent participation, or even a 13 per cent participation, simply cannot be sustained when participation rises to 30 per cent.'  -------------------------------------------------------------------- UK UNIVERSITIES: THE KEY FACTS  -------------------------------------------------------------------- How many full-time students were in UK higher education in 1982 and 1992? 208,000 and 436,000 respectively. What proportion of school-leavers go to university? In 1986 only 14% went to university. Last year it was 31% and it will rise again this year. Are there more universities? Yes. The old polytechnics have been granted university status. Full-time students at polytechnics and college doubled in the decade to 1992, while 'old' universities registered a rise of 40% over the same period Has there been an improvement in standards? 9% were awarded firsts last year. Only 6% were in 1983. How many graduates find work within six months of graduating? Graduate unemployment is presently 10.5% down from last year's all-time high of 11.6%.  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

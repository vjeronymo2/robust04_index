			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Business and the Environment: Assault on pesticides - US plans to minimise the use of high-risk insecticides have spawned a new generation of safer products The Clinton administration's new proposals to encourage reduced-risk pesticides represent a comprehensive reform package which is likely to alter radically the way pesticides are used in the US. In response to increased pressure for new rules by environmental and health activists, the new law would impose a tough, uniform standard for all foods. The proposal would scrap the 35-year-old Delaney Clause, which poses stricter rules on the use of pesticides in processed foods than in fresh foods. In its place, the proposed new law would: Extend the current standard of a 'reasonable certainty of no harm' from canned goods to raw fruits and vegetables. Establish goals for the reduction of pesticide use by 2000. Eliminate the consideration of 'economic benefits' in the pesticide approval process. Enhance enforcement. Give greater priority to safer and reduced-risk pesticides. Require high-risk pesticides to meet the safety standard within three years and all other pesticides within seven years. The package was put together against a background of growing evidence that pesticide levels in the US are too high for the safety of infants and children. It was also a response to increasing concern about the ecological impact of toxic pesticides. However, the proposed regulations are worrying for farmers since a number of existing pesticides would be rendered illegal. In response, farmers would be forced to find alternatives to keep their crops insect- and disease-free. Propitiously, a new generation of pesticides is beginning to make its way on to the market. A number of companies are investing heavily in the development of low-risk pesticides, which range from genetically-altered plants and bacteria to wider use of naturally-occuring pesticides. 'We need to consider alternatives to traditional pesticides,' says Frederick Betz, a senior biologist at the Environmental Protection Agency. 'Fortunately, there's a lot already on the market and a lot which will soon become available. I think the production of reduced-risk pesticides will boom over the next few years.' The Food and Drug Administration has promised speedy review of pesticides which fall into the reduced risk category, in an attempt to move products quickly from the research laboratories into farmers' fields. As a result, a flood of new, alternative pesticides may be approved in the next few years. One of the most novel areas of research is in pheromones, chemicals which influence the sexual behaviour of insects. Pheromones, which are harmless to humans, can be used to lure insects into traps, or can be released in concentrations large enough to disturb mating patterns. 'If we put out enough, the insects can no longer use the pheromone as a signal to find their mate,' says Betz. One US pesticide manufacturer, Ecogen, has identified more than 200 insect-specific sexual hormones and is searching for ways to use them effectively in the field. 'We like to put them in a form in which they can be sprayed, so they'll be more practical,' says David Olson, Ecogen's director of regulatory affairs. 'We also need to have them vaporise slowly, so they'll be effective over the course of a few weeks.' As a possible solution, Ecogen has designed plastic microcapsules which can be used in a spray form and dissolve slowly over time. Another important development is the cultivation of plants which are genetically engineered to resist pests. A number of companies are conducting research in this area and several hope to offer genetically engineered seeds for sale within the next few years. 'Nature produces chemicals which are poisonous to certain insects, but not to humans or beneficial pests,' says Mike Sund, spokesman for Cibaseeds. 'We're trying to create plants which produce these chemicals themselves.' Cibaseeds, part of the Swiss Ciba group, is working jointly with Micogen to develop a maize plant which is resistant to the common and destructive pest, the European corn borer. Monsanto has programmes in place for cotton and potatoes as well as maize and believes this method, besides being good for the environment, will be extremely effective. 'Using traditional, exterior insecticides can be a hit or miss thing,' says Frank Serdy, regulatory affairs director for Monsanto. 'But if the plant itself is excreting the chemicals, the insect gets a load of toxins with every bite. Genetically engineered plants are the wave of the future in pest control.' Manufacturers are also using genetic engineering to alter naturally occurring bacteria, or microbials, which act as toxins to certain insects. 'These bacteria are well-established as safe pesticides,' says Janet Overholt, manager of regulatory affairs for Novo Nordisk. 'But there is a lot of room to improve their efficacy.' Many of the bacteria, for instance, lack stability in the field. They are often sensitive to light, and may last no more than a few hours. Others are not as target-specific as desirable. The pesticide companies are seeking to enhance their effectiveness. However, not all groups are convinced that genetic engineering is the solution. Despite strong support for these programmes from the Clinton administration, activists are already organising consumer boycotts against genetically engineered food products. Ironically, the new, reduced-risk pesticides may encounter more opposition than the high-risk products they will replace. The solution, according to the pesticide group EcoScience, is to stick with natural pesticides. The company researches naturally occurring pesticides in the field and packages them as pesticides. One product, a fungus which was originally found in Iowa, sticks to roaches, eventually causing death. Another bacteria is effective in eliminating post-harvest disease in apples and other tree fruit. Micogen has also discovered a native maize species which is resistant to the corn borer and is using cross-breeding methods to enhance the resistance of cultivated plants. But these solutions are limited. Moreover, because insects tend to build up resistance to pesticides, a wide range of products is needed. 'The key is to use one insecticide for a while and then switch to another, rotating them,' says Serdy. 'No single pesticide will provide the final solution. That's why we need to look at all the alternatives available.'</p>

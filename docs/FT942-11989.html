			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Lazard Bros reveals its inner reserves Lazard Brothers has been forced to tell one of the last great City of London secrets, which is precisely how much capital this most discreet merchant bank has in its hidden reserves and how much profit it makes. Buried in a footnote to accounts filed at Companies House is the disclosure that it has Pounds 34.75m in hidden reserves and total shareholders' funds of Pounds 163m. Profits in 1993 were Pounds 40m before tax. It has lifted the veil, with the greatest reluctance, because an amendment to the UK Companies Act this year required all British banks to end the practice of making undisclosed transfers to secret inner reserves to disguise true profits and capital. Most banks dispensed with the practice years ago, but Lazard's coyness in revealing all was probably prompted by a concern that outsiders might be disappointed by what they would see. Its assets are far smaller than British rivals SG Warburg and Schroders and tiny compared with Goldman Sachs of the US. Warburg had shareholder funds of Pounds 889.4m at the year end of March, 1993, and reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 148.2m. Schroders had shareholder funds of Pounds 674.5m at the end of 1993 and reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 195.8m. However the Lazard philosophy is that what matters is not the size of your capital resources, but what you do with them. Its return on assets has normally been above average and last year 24 directors and executives earned more than Pounds 230,000 each. The chairman, Mr David Verey, received Pounds 812,000 in remuneration. It is also slightly misleading to view it in isolation since it is part of an international partnership consisting of the more profitable Lazard Freres in New York together with the original Parisian bank, neither of which disclose their figures. Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has an interest in all three siblings. The UK government enacted the bank accounting reform in anticipation of a change in European Community law. However, to Lazard's great irritation, this EC reform has not materialised. As a result, its continental peers, including Lazard in Paris, can still disguise their profits. Whether Lazard's irritation was a factor in its decision last year to withold its regular contribution to the Conservative Party - which had been Pounds 20,000 in 1992 - it would not say. In keeping with tradition, it would not discuss the accounts at all.</p>

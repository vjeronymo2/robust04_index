			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Growth expected to continue at Hays Hays, the business service group, increased its pre-tax profits by 33 per cent to Pounds 38.6m in the six months to December 31. Mr Ronnie Frost, executive chairman, said the distribution and personnel core activities both increased profits by a substantial margin while commercial activity saw profits increase more modestly. He said: 'The improvement in profit is expected to continue in the second half, although the percentage increase will be lower due to the stronger performance in the comparable period last year.' Hays said the trading environment of its UK businesses had slowly improved since January, 1993, whilst the German and French economies remained in recession. In distribution, operating profits increased by 34 per cent to Pounds 23.4m. Mr Frost said the chemical distribution profits were adversely affected by over Pounds 1m as a result of the weakness in the world price of caustic soda, although sales volumes had been well maintained. He said: 'There was a particularly strong performance from packaged chemicals which continued to increase both market share and margins, winning a new contract with Shell for the distribution of solvents.' In personnel, operating profits bounced back from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 6.4m. Temporary placements were particularly buoyant and the number of permanent placements had also started to increase, but at a slower rate. Operating profits from commercial activities rose from Pounds 10.6m to Pounds 11.7m. Britdoc, the group's overnight parcels business, had expanded. However, profits from records management fell as demand shifted from space managed by clients towards Hays fast access storage. Earnings per share increased by 31 per cent to 6.4p (4.9p). The interim dividend was lifted by 15 per cent to 1.95p (1.7p). COMMENT A share price unchanged at 309p seemed scant reward for announcing this sort of profits increase. But on a day that the FTSE 100 fell 41.5 points, just holding on to recent gains was no mean achievement. The results were in line with expectations, although analysts were disappointed that the share of profits coming from the group's highly regarded commercial activities fell back from 35 to 28 per cent. Forecast full-year profits of Pounds 85m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 22, a 30 per cent premium to the market. The shares have outperformed by 16 per cent over the past year, so they certainly are not cheap at this level. However, Hays still has plenty of recovery potential in both personnel and caustic soda distribution, even if Mr Frost does not expect the chemical's price to firm much before the end of 1994.</p>

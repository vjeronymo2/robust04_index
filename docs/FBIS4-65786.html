			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ahtisaari Questions Vayrynen's Views </F> on the EU"]    [Text] President Martti Ahtisaari commented on former  Foreign Minister Paavo Vayrynen's (Center Party) suggestion,  according to which Finland's membership in the European Union  [EU] should be postponed. Ahtisaari noted, in connection with an  article that appeared in the newspaper SAVON SANOMAT last  Tuesday [26 April], that such a debate should have taken place  at the time when Vayrynen was also in the cabinet and was party  to the decision to apply for membership.    Ahtisaari said that he had not noticed Vayrynen's comments  receiving any significant support from within the party.    "This is the opinion of a single citizen, who, of course, is  entitled to voice it," concluded Ahtisaari.</p>

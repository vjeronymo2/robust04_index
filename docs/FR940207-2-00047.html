Existing DOE procedures for public participation in power rate adjustments (10 CFR Part 903) became effective on September 18, 1985 (50 FR 37837).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These power and transmission rates are established pursuant to the DOE Organization Act (42 U.S.C. &sect;7101  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ); the Reclamation Act of 1902 (43 U.S.C. &sect;371  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) as amended and supplemented by subsequent enactments, particularly section 9(c) of the Reclamation Project Act of 1939 (43 U.S.C. &sect;485h(c)); section 2 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1935 (49 Stat. 1028, 1039); the Parker-Davis Act of 1954 (68 Stat. 143); Final Rule (10 CFR Part 904) published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 51 FR 43154 on November 28, 1986; the DOE financial reporting policies, procedures, and methodology (DOE RA 6120.2 dated September 20, 1979); and the procedures for public participation in rate adjustments for power and transmission service marketed by Western (10 CFR Part 903) published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 50 FR 37837 on September 18, 1985.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based upon data available in fiscal year (FY) 1991, the PRS for the P&hyph;DP showed that the existing composite rate of 9.03 mills/kWh for firm power, firm transmission rate of $8.20/kW/year, nonfirm transmission rate of 1.50 mills/kWh, and a firm transmission service rate for SLCA/IP of $4.10/kW/season would not provide sufficient revenues to pay the project costs within the prescribed time periods. The Ratesetting PRS indicates substantial rate increases for firm power and firm and nonfirm transmission service are required in order to meet revenue requirements for FY 1994 through the end of the study. Because this represents a substantial increase over the existing P&hyph;DP rates, Western is proposing to implement a two-step rate process for firm power and firm and nonfirm transmission service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rate increases are due largely to the increases in replacement and addition activities on P&hyph;DP. The original P&hyph;DP investment was fully paid in 1984 and the irrigation investment was fully paid in 1986.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the P&hyph;DP is undergoing a major replacement and refurbishment plan needed for environmental compliance, safety, and reliability. The rate increases can also be attributed to an increase in purchased power expense. The increase in purchased power expense resulted from flooding conditions along the Colorado River in southwestern Arizona which created a generation deficiency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the 143-day comment period, Western received 31 written comments. In addition, nine speakers commented during the September 11, 1992, public comment forum. During the second comment period of 70 days, Western received 19 written comments. In addition, seven speakers commented during the July 14, 1993, public comment forum. All comments and responses are addressed in the rate order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rate Order No. WAPA&hyph;55, confirming, approving, and placing the P&hyph;DP proposed rate adjustments into effect on an interim basis is issued, and the rate schedules PD&hyph;F4, PD&hyph;FT4, PD&hyph;NFT4, and PD&hyph;FCT4 will be promptly submitted to FERC for confirmation and approval on a final basis.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Washington, D.C., January 6, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> William H.

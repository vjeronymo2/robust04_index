Such actions can be seen as a reflection of the  unwillingness  of the business community to understand how AIDS is transmitted  and how the HIV virus is spread, as it is understood by the  international community concerned with AIDS.    Dr. Gandung Hartono, MPH [Master of Public Health], former  Chairman of the National Committee for Responding to AIDS, said  this to reporters last Monday [29 November] evening in Jakarta  after leading the swearing-in ceremony for 15 counsellors who  have joined the nongovernmental organization Mitra Indonesia.    Dr. Hudoyo Hupadio, MPH, is the chairman of this  organization, which was officially established today 1 December  1993 to coincide with World AIDS Day, and Dr. Gandung Hartono is  its honorary chairman.    A reporter who had heard of a large Indonesian company that  fired an employee who was infected with the HIV virus, the virus  suspected of being the cause of AIDS, asked whether firing an  employee under these circumstances was proper.    In response to that question, Gandung said that in the first  place high-ranking officers of the company that fired the  employee must not understand the simplest facts about AIDS.  [passage omitted]    In the second place, said Gandung, we have to check to see  whether the company which fired the employee who had AIDS is  consistent in its policies, meaning that if a company has a  policy of always firing employees who have been diagnosed as  infected with AIDS, the company would have to spend a lot of  money to administer periodic blood tests to every single  employee and to the company's high-ranking officers to check  whether the HIV virus had entered their bloodstream. [passage  omitted]    Anticipating the possibility that many Indonesian companies  will take such incorrect actions in the future, Gandung urged  the organizations active in the fight against AIDS to hold  immediate discussions about manpower infected with AIDS. What  must be discussed is how a company can treat workers who are  infected with the AIDS virus in a humanitarian way.    By providing every member of society who requires it with  information and counselling about AIDS, Mitra Indonesia  emphasizes services to individuals and to small groups,  especially those who are at high risk, those who are infected  with the HIV virus and those who already have AIDS.    Face-to-face counselling is provided at 78 Kebon Kacang 9  Street, Jakarta 10240 every Monday through Sunday from 3 pm to 8  pm. For the time being there are only 15 counsellors from Mitra  Indonesia who have already sworn to undertake that task in  accordance with the code of ethics of counsellors for the Mitra  Indonesia AIDS Hotline. Counselling is also available by  telephone at 021-3100855.    It is reported from Bandung that Hadi Marjanto Abednego,  Director General for the Eradication of Infectious Diseases and  for the Improvement of Health in the Residential Environment,  said that the Greater Jakarta Special Capital Region now has the  highest number of people who are HIV-positive or who have AIDS.  As of the beginning of last November, there were 58 people with  AIDS or who were HIV-positive in Jakarta, 26 of them with AIDS  and 32 who were HIV positive.    "The number of cases has definitely increased. This disease  spreads fast," Abednego told the press in Bandung yesterday.    Other provinces that have high rates of AIDS or HIV-positive  infection are Irian Jaya with 54 patients, Bali with 23  patients, East Java with 16 patients, Riau with 12 patients and  West Java with four patients. Nationally, there are 175 people  who have AIDS or who are HIV positive, 42 of them with AIDS and  133 who are HIV positive. These patients are spread out over 12  provinces.    "Although the official figures show only 175 people who have  AIDS or who are HIV-positive, one patient with AIDS or who is  HIV positive can potentially spread it to 100 others. That's why  we must be on the alert for the approximately 175,000 other  patients who are below the surface and who are not in the  Department of Health's official count," he said.

			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MOTHER, INFANT INJURED IN ATTACK ON PACOIMA STREET  </P> <P> A man apparently under the influence of drugs went berserk on a Pacoima street  Thursday, striking a woman on the head with a brick and injuring her 1-year-old  daughter before police subdued him, Los Angeles police said.  </P> <P> Raynaldo Mendibles, 31, who lives in the 13600 block of Daventry Street where  the attack occurred shortly after 3 p.m., was arrested and treated at Holy  Cross Medical Center for head injuries after police struck him with batons when  he lunged at them with the brick, Sgt. Robert Ontiveros said.  </P> <P> Two women also struck Mendibles with a broomstick and a vacuum bottle in an  effort to subdue him, Ontiveros said. The man was beating himself on the head  with the brick when police arrived, Ontiveros said.  </P> <P> Mendibles, who was listed in stable condition, was later transferred to the Los  Angeles County-USC Medical Center jail ward, a nursing supervisor at Holy Cross  said.  </P> <P> Marguerita Valdez, 29, a neighbor of Mendibles, suffered a fractured skull and  was being treated at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Panorama City, Ontiveros  said. Her daughter, Natalie, was being treated at the same hospital for  unspecified injuries, he said.  </P> <P> Their conditions were not immediately available, but they were considered well  enough to be transferred to Kaiser from another hospital, authorities said. It  was not known if Mendibles struck the baby with the brick or if the girl was  injured when her mother dropped her during the attack.  </P> <P> A man who saw Valdez lying wounded on the sidewalk angrily approached  Mendibles, asking "What did that guy do to my wife?" But police persuaded him  to back off, a witness said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART SUBSIDIES  </P> <P> Theodore Bikel in "Cheap Way to Make Hay at Expense of Culture" (Op-Ed Page,  March 15) seems to confuse freedom of expression with entitlement to subsidy.  </P> <P> Many taxpayers do not object to the creation of art which they might find  offensive, but resent the notion that they must have their sensibilities  insulted at their expense.  </P> <P> Some of us even dabble in art ourselves, but we lack the unmitigated gall to  expect others to involuntarily pay for us so we don't have to get a job doing  something constructive in society.  </P> <P> Furthermore, to compare art subsidies against federal endowment to science is  absurd. Science seeks physical truth, with that attainment driven by continued  progress.  </P> <P> Art is entirely subjective with no appeal to anything beyond superficial and  highly personal tastes -- in fact most artists cringe at being universally  appealing.  </P> <P> Hence, I submit that American taxpayers are not obligated to support would-be  taxi drivers from leaving their studios. If artists want funding, let them find  patrons who appreciate their efforts and leave us unenlightened hoi polloi  alone.  </P> <P> G.W. THIELMAN  </P> <P> Ridgecrest  </P></p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool World wool markets are still far from buoyant as the end of the selling season approaches. It is hard to discern much growth in demand in any of the leading consuming countries, and there may be some softness in prices at next week's closing sales, when the total offering will be substantially larger than this week's. There is little change in prices for Bradford tops. The AWC market indicator yesterday was 450 cents a kilogram compared with 459 cents a week before.</p>

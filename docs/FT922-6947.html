			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / International Company News: De Benedetti in Hungary deal COFINEC, the central European investment vehicle of Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the Italian financier, has taken control of Kner, a Hungarian printing group. The move is Cofinec's latest step towards its goal of building a Hungarian packaging business with annual turnover of Dollars 100m. Cofinec - controlled by Mr De Benedetti's Cerus investment arm - and the Hungarian Investment Company - the country fund managed by John Govett of the UK - bought 85 per cent of Kner in an investment worth Dollars 20m. The acquisition follows last year's purchase of Petofi, Hungary's most important packaging producer. Cofinec said that Petofi was in the international equity market and that a transaction would be announced soon. The Petofi offering comes after investments by the Hungary country funds and international institutions such as the Hungarian American Enterprise Fund and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Petofi was the first industrial company in eastern Europe to receive credit from the EBRD, which has given priority to eastern Europe's underdeveloped packaging industry. Mr De Benedetti's group has been encouraged by rapid improvements in productivity and exports at Petofi. It is looking to build a more extensive packaging and printing business in central Europe. 'Hungary is still a low-cost country and close to markets which we want to penetrate very much,' explained Mr De Benedetti yesterday. 'This started as an investment opportunity and turned into a business opportunity.' Mr De Benedetti also said that Olivetti, the Italian computer company he controls, was working on additional orders for systems from Hungarian banks. Olivetti already has a contract with Hungary's National Savings Bank. However, Mr De Benedetti said that Olivetti was not planning any acquisitions in eastern Europe, in spite of a recent decision by International Business Machines to take a minority stake in Muszertechnika, Hungary's leading computer company.</p>

			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENDPAPERS: THE WORD AND THE MAN  </P> <P> D. H. Lawrence is the flip side of James Joyce. They are as Protestant to  Catholic, country to city.  </P> <P> Their celebratory rituals, the literary conferences, are as Vatican Council to  Methodist encampment. The Joyceans are superbly organized. The James Joyce  International Foundation holds an international symposium every second year in  a place relevant to Joyce. The in-between year is filled by a conference in the  United States. American Joyceans simply cannot go 24 months without convening.  </P> <P> No Joycean has to wonder about the date. Joyce, Jesuitically trained, created  his own personal ecclesiastical calendar. Conferences are held on the days  surrounding either June 16 -- Bloomsday, the date on which the action of his  masterpiece, "Ulysses," is set -- or his birthday, Feb. 2.  </P> <P> Lawrenceans, like their author, are as rambling as an English garden. They  never know when their next conference is coming, nor where. Lawrence wandered  the globe before dying in Venice in 1930 at age 44. This summer, a combination  of academic friendships and local largesse (plastic briefcases courtesy of the  Conseil de la Region Herault) brought them to Montpellier in southwestern  France, which last month saw the first major international gathering of  Lawrenceans since 1985.  </P> <P> The Joyce conference, which ended on June 16, was held in Monaco, the home of  the Princess Grace Irish Library. Very few from Monaco made the journey  westward to Montpellier. Lawrenceans are a different order from Joyceans.  Joyceans believe in The Word. Lawrenceans believe in The Man. "I read Lawrence  to learn about life," Prof. Chong-wha Chung of Korea University in Seoul told  me.  </P> <P> For those who braved them both, the conferences gave an opportunity to compare  the two incompatible breeds. Absurdities both -- the Joyce, with nearly 300  delegates, absurdly elegant and overproduced; the Lawrence, half that size,  maddeningly scruffy, sweaty and ramshackle. Yet both were full of bright,  genial people, mainly university teachers, willing to devote five days  (Lawrence) or a full week (Joyce) to debating the meaning of life and love and  language.  </P> <P> Joyce, who was born in 1882 and died in 1941, and Lawrence have much in common:  two thin, shy, sickly, monogamous men who stayed clear of World War I, to write  instead of the other war -- the war between the sexes. With their work, they  changed the novel and burst the bonds of censorship for those who write in  English.  </P> <P> Lawrenceans, as a group, seem older, heavier and less merry than Joyceans.  Their beards and sandals and loose shirts only accentuated the impression of a  crowd of Lawrence look-alikes.  </P> <P> Lawrence seems to attract more American professors with last-for-first names,  far fewer theorists, hardly a Marxist in the lot and few post-structuralists.  In general, according to a leading American Lawrencean, Keith Cushman of North  Carolina, they are far less cosmopolitan.  </P> <P> "Joyce was truly international," he said. "Lawrence was much-traveled. But  wherever he went, he remained English."  </P> <P> But Lawrenceans give no quarter to Joyce, whom they find cerebral, unfeeling  and, to their students, unreadable. They do not want luxury accommodation. Like  their author, who lived in cottages and cabins from Cornwall to New Mexico,  they are ready to rough it.  </P> <P> Feminism, however, and the difference between the sexes, dominated both  gatherings. "I hadn't expected such a gendered experience," said one Canadian  attending her first Joyce international. At every Joyce conference there is a  "women's caucus."  </P> <P> Imagine their surprise this year, when they were told by the library that their  speaker would be Shirley Conran, one of Monaco's resident English literati.  "You mean, the woman who wrote 'Which of you bitches is my mother?' is going to  talk to us about creative writing?" gasped one.  </P> <P> Conran, however, cleverly sailed into the real gender dilemma of the female  academic: how to get husbands to help with the housework.  </P> <P> Academic scholars put divorce lawyers in the pale with their discussions of  what constitutes evidence of the consummated sexual act. One American professor  reported a student ringing up at 3 in the morning, having just finished  "Ulysses." "Do Molly and Bloom sleep together again?" he demanded. (She  couldn't say.)  </P> <P> The Lawrenceans waded into real anatomy in discussing the "Excurse" chapter in  "Women in Love." What actually happened down around the "back and base" of the  loins? They were told of one academic couple -- named -- who took the book into  bed with them and tried to work out what was supposed to be fitting into what.  The result? No satisfaction nor elucidation.  </P> <P> And Lawrence, the self-styled Priest of Love, himself? In a panel on biography,  Jeffrey Meyers of the University of Colorado, whose "D. H. Lawrence" recently  was published by Alfred A. Knopf (see Page 1), described an interview with the  painter Dorothy Brett in which all he wanted to know is "Did you screw Murry  (John Middleton Murry) in 1919"? (Cries from the floor: "She did!")  </P> <P> More seriously, had Brett and Lawrence had actually "done it" in Ravello in  1926? Brett, according to one version, said that Lawrence tried but failed,  excusing the failure with a comment on a part of Brett's anatomy which he said  was "wrong."  </P> <P> My text reads "pubes" for the part in question. Another version has, instead,  an American word rhyming with "pubes" but referring to another part of the  anatomy. The learned consensus was that "pubes" was decidedly more Lawrencean  than that American vulgarism.  </P> <P> Lawrenceans, more than Joyceans, love the master's words read aloud. They  linger lovingly over phrases like "a tumbling heap of pink petals." Unhappily,  the same love envelops their own words. Long papers, honed on word processors  in Tulsa or Swansea, were delivered in inaudible monotone to listeners  somnolent in the Mediterranean heat.  </P> <P> Occasionally, Joyceans blur the line between art and life. (Some suggest that  "Finnegan's Wake" contains hidden clues about incestuous relations between  Joyce and his daughter.) Lawrenceans do it all the time. Seeing Lawrence as a  prophet, complete with beard, piercing eyes and untimely death, they seem to  expect a Second Coming. "The world needs Lawrence today," said one woman, "more  than ever."  </P> <P> But nobody's perfect. Anthony Burgess, Monaco's reigning literary monarch, said  in the Joyceans' opening speech: "I write for a living. Joyce never did."  </P> <P> Lawrenceans more openly acknowledge imperfections in their god:  repetitiousness, poor endings, violence toward his fictional women, and toward  his real-life wife, Frieda, too. Mark Spilka, speaking not only as a professor  at Brown University but as a worker with "Wife-Abusers of Rhode Island," said  jovially that Lawrence "would qualify for sentencing under current law."  </P> <P> In death, both writers are united by 1990s problems with editions and estates.  The Joyce world is in disarray over the "correct" text of "Ulysses," which  contains many errors. Its scholars too write in fear of the author's grandson,  Stephen Joyce, who appeared before them to say that he was taking a personal  interest in all matters concerning his late grandfather. "You may not like it,"  he told them, "but that's the way it's going to be."  </P> <P> The re-editing of Lawrence is even more controversial because Cambridge  University Press considers that the new editions create new works of all the  books, thus extending the copyright well into the new century. Gerald  Pollinger, whose literary agency controls the Lawrence estate, is never shy of  reminding writers that they must pay him for use of copyright material.  </P> <P> At the Lawrenceans' final "banquet" -- self-service in the university cafeteria  -- Pollinger, tall, heavy, powerful, strode to the microphone like the chairman  of the governors at an orphanage's Open Day. He told little jokes. He gave away  trinkets. Then he gave some unsettling news:  </P> <P> A fine trove of new Lawrence material has been found -- letters from his  Croydon years, documents, perhaps even a short story or two. . . . The Lawrence  scholars would not have long to wait to see it. It would all be put up for  sale.  </P> <P> Peter Preston of the University of Nottingham, amiable organizer of the  conference, then announced that the university (near Lawrence's birthplace) is  to set up a D. H. Lawrence International Centre and will bid for the new  Lawrence material.  </P> <P> Nottingham against the big American university libraries? In my view, it  doesn't stand a chance. Unless, of course, a fairy princess comes along.  </P></p>

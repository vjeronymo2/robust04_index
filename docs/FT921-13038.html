			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Fifth TV network terms modified THE Independent Television Commission yesterday radically modified the terms on which the franchise for the new national fifth television channel is to be awarded. The ITC has dropped requirements on everything from the amounts of money to be paid to the Treasury to the level of original programming, in what is a clearly a response to fears that Channel 5 would be stillborn. After listening to representations from potential bidders the ITC has scrapped a requirement that the channel operator would have to pay 5 per cent of net advertising revenue to the Treasury as well as the annual sum bid for the franchise. The ITC has now decided that 'zero' is the appropriate level to set the percentage of qualifying revenue for each of the 10 years of the franchise. The commission has also modified its original plans on how quickly an operator has to build the channel network. The draft proposals suggested that the channel had to begin broadcasting by the end of 1994 at the latest and that it should reach a minimum of 40 per cent of the UK population. Now the ITC prefers a more gradual approach. The requirement will be for coverage of 30 per cent of the population within a year of the start of the service or the end of 1994, whichever is later. The ITC has also reduced its targets for originally produced programmes. Originally they were 40 per cent at the start of the service rising to 65 per cent by the end of year five. The new figures are 30 per cent at the outset rising to 55 per cent. In the Appeal Court yesterday Mr Patrick Elias QC, for the ITC, rejected Television South West's claim that the commission had made an irrational decision in awarding the franchise for south-west England to Westcountry TV. He said parliament had conferred the decision-making role on the ITC, yet TSW seemed to be saying the court should substitute its own view for that of the ITC. The hearing continues today.</p>

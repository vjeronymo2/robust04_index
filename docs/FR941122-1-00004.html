			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The requirement under the Leland Act to eliminate enhanced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funding levels for certain Program activities, resulted in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need for the Department to revise forms FNS&hyph;366A, Budget  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Projection, and SF&hyph;269, Financial Status Report to include a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> column for reporting activities funded at the 50 percent funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate. The SF&hyph;269 is a nationwide form required by OMB to be used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by all government agencies to report financial status. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department regulations at 7 CFR 3015.84 implemented this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mandatory use of SF&hyph;269. The revisions have been sent to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and have been approved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under OMB No. 0584&hyph;0083 for the FNS&hyph;366A and 0505&hyph;0008 for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SF&hyph;269. OMB also requires the use of form SF&hyph;270 when an agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wants to adjust the Program's financial status when the letter-of-credit is not used. The Department regulations at 7 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3015.84(b) implemented this mandatory use of SF&hyph;270. A specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference to the use of form SF&hyph;270 for Food Stamp Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes appears in &sect;277.11 of this proposed action. While the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> form is approved for use by OMB under OMB No. 0505&hyph;0008, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department had inadvertently neglected to inform OMB of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burden hours associated with the use of this form for Food Stamp  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program purposes. For Food Stamp Program purposes only, burden  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with SF&hyph;270 is estimated to average l hour per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response. This estimated burden assumes that each respondent (53  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State welfare agencies) would submit a SF&hyph;270 at least three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> times annually. Thus, burden associated with OMB No. 0505&hyph;0008  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will increase an estimated 159 hours annually. Pursuant to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507), the increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burden estimate will be forwarded to OMB for inclusion into the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overall burden estimates approved under OMB No. 0505&hyph;0008.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The public reporting burden discussed in the previous paragraphs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for OMB Nos. 0584&hyph;0083 and 0505&hyph;0008 includes the time for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this burden estimate or any aspect of the information collection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State Management Section, Program Accountability Division  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (address above) and to the Office of Information and Regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Affairs, OMB, Room 10235, New Executive Office Building,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Washington, D.C. 20503, Attn: Wendy Taylor, Desk Officer for FNS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The remaining provisions of this proposed rulemaking do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contain reporting or recordkeeping requirements subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval by OMB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Leland Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66), signed on August 10, 1993, made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a number of changes to the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (the Food Stamp Act). This proposed rulemaking pertains to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative funding rate provisions established in Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13961 of the Leland Act. These provisions are discussed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following paragraphs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most State agency food stamp administrative costs are reimbursed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the Department's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal reimbursement rate of 50 percent. However, certain State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency activities are reimbursed at higher or ``enhanced'' rates,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including fraud control, automated data processing (ADP) system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development, and Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (SAVE). Under the current rules in 7 CFR 277.4, 277.15, 277.18,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 277.19 of Food Stamp Program Regulations, the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reimbursement rates for these activities were, until  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> April 1, 1994, 75 percent for fraud control, 75 or 63 percent for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ADP development, and 100 percent for SAVE.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 13961 of the Leland Act reduces the Federal reimbursement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate for fraud control, ADP development, and SAVE costs to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regular 50 percent Federal reimbursement level. The new rate was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective April 1, 1994 and applies to costs incurred on or after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> April 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Costs for a particular activity listed above for which a legal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liability to pay existed at or before the close of business on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> March 31, 1994 may be claimed at the enhanced rate in effect at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that time for the particular activity. Costs satisfying this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition are direct costs of goods and other property delivered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to and accepted by the State or local agency; direct costs of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services rendered to the State or local agency by employees,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contractors, subrecipients and other payees; and associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indirect costs. All costs incurred on or after April 1, 1994,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including costs for which obligations (encumbrances) but not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liabilities to pay had been created before April 1, 1994, shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be claimed at the regular 50 percent Federal reimbursement rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unless written approval is subsequently received from FNS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delaying the effective date, under certain specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances, as explained below. If FNS grants such approval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after the April 1, 1994 effective date, an appropriate adjustment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Federal funding will be made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Fraud Control Activity_Sections 277.4, 277.15, 272.2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> On August 10, 1979, the Department published a final rule at 44  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FR 47037 which allows enhanced Federal reimbursement at the 75  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent rate for food stamp investigations and prosecutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Food Stamp Program regulations also refer to Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reimbursement as Federal Financial Participation (FFP). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department set out the procedures for State agencies to receive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 75 percent FFP for fraud control activity in that rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 13961 of the Leland Act amended Section 16 of the Food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Stamp Act (7 U.S.C. 2025) to reduce the Federal reimbursement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate for fraud control activity from 75 percent to the regular 50  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent rate. The new rate is effective, by law, on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> April 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The new rate applies to food stamp investigations, prosecutions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative disqualification hearings, claims collections, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other allowable fraud control activity. It applies to all such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs incurred on or after April 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

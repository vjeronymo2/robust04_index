			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / International Company News: Bank of Nova Scotia raises dividend by 6% Bank of Nova Scotia has raised its quarterly dividend after posting a 6 per cent rise in fiscal 1994 earnings. The bank, Canada's fourth-biggest, attributed the higher earnings to a combination of strong investment banking revenues, a 10 per cent growth in assets, an improved developing world loan portfolio, and tight cost controls. Net earnings advanced to CDollars 714m (USDollars 553.5m), equal to CDollars 2.98 per common share, in the year to October 31, from CDollars 676m, or CDollars 2.94 a share, a year earlier. A larger number of shares outstanding pushed the return on equity down to 14.4 per cent from 15.7 per cent. The quarterly dividend has been raised from 28 to 29 cents a share. Loan-loss provisions rose to CDollars 465m from CDollars 449m. The latest figure includes a CDollars 300m reversal of developing world loan provisions, of which half was re-allocated to specific provisions for other borrowers.</p>

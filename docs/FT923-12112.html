			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Global fall masks the structural damage A fall of just 0.8 per cent in the FT-Actuaries World Index last week disguises the depressing effect of events last Thursday and Friday. Europe was extremely nervous about Thursday's Bundesbank meeting in Frankfurt; the 0.75 percentage-point rise in the German discount rate was just a quarter-point higher than expected, but this hit the dollar, and bund futures. What with that, more scandals in Milan, and the sickening damage done to construction share prices in Spain by the deteriorating local economy, a 2.4 per cent fall in Europe on the week seemed almost a gentle reaction. In the US, which actually rose by a fine fraction over the week, the effects of Mr Ross Perot's withdrawal from the presidential race on Thursday - arguably bullish, since markets thought that it would help President Bush - were forgotten on Friday when equities were hurt by disappointing earnings from IBM, an unexpectedly large monthly trade deficit and talk of triple-dip recession. Japan really lost its way on Friday, too, when rumours of an investigation by the new securities commission into loss compensation and share price manipulation left the Nikkei average down 2.6 per cent on the day, a foretaste of what happened yesterday. America and the Asia Pacific region had their brighter sides. In Mexico, a 7.4 per cent advance followed a poor June quarter, as Telmex was authorised to buy back Dollars 300m worth of its shares, local election results were favourable and Mr Perot's retreat boosted already strong hopes for the North American Free Trade Agreement. Hong Kong investors and speculators did their best to stretch the best performance in the world this year. New Zealand, up only 1.1 per cent since 1992 began, went into the black last week with a 1.7 per cent gain on recent falls in domestic interest rates.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                         MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                 % change   % change in           % change in local currency **        sterling**  US Dollars**            1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year    Start of  Start of     Start of                                         1992      1992         1992  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      -3.40  -10.25  -23.78     -3.93     -4.50        -0.50 Belgium      -0.06   +0.12   -1.16     +1.78     +1.24        +5.49 Denmark      -0.98   -0.99  -19.31    -11.67    -11.08        -7.35 Finland      -4.15   -4.67  -23.78     -3.77     -4.69        -0.69 France       -2.97   -5.94   +3.81     +2.49     +3.20        +7.52 Germany      -2.03   -3.62   +0.38     +6.18     +5.81       +10.25 Ireland      +1.67   -3.26   -6.01     -5.76     -5.64        -1.69 Italy        -1.60   -7.59  -18.12    -11.88    -12.47        -8.77 Netherlands  -1.86   -3.48   +0.94     +5.06     +4.57        +8.95 Norway       -3.14   -8.41  -25.83     -7.05     -7.37        -3.49 Spain        -5.68  -11.48  -15.32    -10.02    -10.69        -6.94 Sweden       -2.33   -4.88  -16.43     +2.86     +3.14        +7.47 Switzerland  -2.68   -3.27   +4.60     +9.00     +8.29       +12.82 UK           -2.48   -6.55   -5.02     -2.20     -2.20        +1.90 EUROPE       -2.45   -5.63   -4.03     -0.18     -0.25        +3.93 Australia    -1.26   -1.19   +3.29     -2.89     -8.71        -4.88 Hong Kong    +1.94   +5.22  +54.67    +44.99    +40.04       +45.92 Japan        -0.85   +0.75  -28.94    -26.40    -29.16       -26.19 Malaysia     -1.02   +1.75   -0.40     +5.31    +10.28       +14.91 New Zealand  +1.72   +2.62   +2.39     +1.08     -1.64        +2.49 Singapore    -4.43   -5.93   +2.03     -4.15     -7.43        -3.55 Canada       +0.67   +3.55   -4.22     -2.09     -8.69        -4.86 USA          +0.14   +2.75   +9.52     -0.50     -4.51        -0.50 Mexico       +7.45   +3.03  +37.11     +9.93     +3.00        +7.32 South Africa +0.25   -5.44   +0.27     +1.40    -18.60       -15.19 WORLD INDEX  -0.77   -0.25   -6.20     -7.79    -10.76        -7.01  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on July 17th 1992.

			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Beverley holders approve deals to eliminate debt Shareholders in Beverley Group, the engineering concern, yesterday approved the sale of a group of properties and businesses to a vehicle controlled by the company's executive directors. The company, which says the transactions, including the sale of a cash rich subsidiary for Pounds 1, are designed to eliminate debt, has now embarked on an acquisition programme. The first purchase is likely to be announced by the end of March. Mr Colin Robinson, chairman, said Beverley was now in a net cash position. It would seek to double its size through an acquisition, which would be funded through some form of equity capital raising. About 15 private shareholders attended the extraordinary meeting in Bristol to vote on the proposals. These called for the sale of Gall Thomson Marine, the group's most profitable subsidiary, to Villiers, an independent USM-quoted company, for Pounds 4m. The second resolution proposed the sale of two subsidiaries for Pounds 1 each to Woodlands Grange Engineering, the executive directors' privately owned company. One of the companies being sold was left with Pounds 237,000 in cash, the amount which Beverley said it would cost to make the business's employees redundant. Debt of Pounds 812,000 owed by the second company to the quoted parent was written off and bank borrowings of Pounds 359,000 repaid. All the shareholders present voted in favour, although some proxy votes had been cast against the sales to executive directors. Mr Robinson said as there had been no need for a poll, the proxies had not been counted. The executive directors involved in the transactions did not vote. One institutional investor said that although there had been initial concerns over the transactions with directors the benefits had 'outweighed the hit that we as shareholders would have had to take if they had not gone through'.</p>

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (11): Goodbye Sierra, hello Mondeo - A flock of new models and facelifts has broadened the buyer's choice NEW MODELS are coming and old favourites have had major mid-life facelifts. The fleet market this year may prove to be turbulent for the car makers but buyers are going to find themselves spoiled for choice. First, Ford's new front-wheel driven Mondeo is replacing that fleet buyer's staple, the Sierra. From March onwards it will be locking horns with well-established favourites such as the revamped and significantly improved Vauxhall Cavaliers and Peugeot 405s. Mondeo, which from the outset will be offered as a 4-door saloon, 5-door hatchback or estate, promises to put new life into Ford's fleet business. Its styling is nothing like so distinctive as the Sierra's 10 years ago but even the entry model comes with a driver's side airbag and power steering. Multi-valve 1.6, 1.8 and 2-litre, 4-cylinder petrol engines with 5-speed manual gears are standard. Ford's own Dagenham-built 1.8-litre turbocharged and intercooled diesel will be a popular minority choice. It outperforms the 1.6 litre Mondeo but the figures suggest an average fuel consumption of close to 50 mpg (5.65 1/100km) of diesel compared with 42 mpg (6.73 1/100 km) of unleaded petrol. There will be posh Ghia versions of the Mondeo with air-conditioning as standard and a host of options such as traction control or four-wheel drive, a new US-designed 4-speed automatic transmission, leather trim and cruise control. These - and the forthcoming 2.5 litre V6 engined Mondeo - could tempt user-choosers out of their Scorpios. General Motors and PSA made pre-emptive strikes against Mondeo late last year. The Vauxhall Cavalier (Opel Vectra) and Peugeot 405 ranges have been restyled and, more importantly, refined. Though hardly a fleet car, the Cavalier 4x4 Turbo with a 6-speed close ratio gearbox is either a cut-price Calibra with more room inside or a rival for Audi's upmarket quattro models. Peugeot, perhaps stung by criticism of patchy build quality, has given the latest 405 the solid feel of a BMW to go with its class-leading ride and handling. Though its UK market introduction is still several months off, the Swindon-built new Honda Accord (and its Rover counterpart, the 600) will raise the stakes in the 2-litre executive market. A dark horse that all the fleet car providers will be looking at is Citroen's new Xantia, due in Britain by summer, with petrol engines with diesels following soon after. Xantia replaces the BX, which did much to establish Citroen in the UK as a car for normal people, not just enthusiasts. But it is bigger than the BX and elegantly styled, with lines reflecting both the large XM's lean and hungry look and the smaller ZX's chubbiness. This sophisticated car, with electronically controlled semi-active suspension, is expected to be priced competitively against Mondeo and Cavalier. Will 1993 see the products of Japanese transplants in the UK being regarded as proper British cars by fleet managers and their financial masters? It should, because the Sunderland-built Nissan Primera and the Derby-built, Welsh-engined Toyota Carina E have around 80 per cent EC (and about 50 per cent UK) content. Magazines which persist in regarding motoring as a sporting activity, not personal transport, are scornful of the Primera's and Carina E's alleged blandness. Real world drivers find them quiet, comfortable and economical. In reality, they are Ford, Vauxhall and Rover alternatives. The psychological barrier against buying a 'Japanese' car is the only thing likely to prevent them from making a substantial impact in the fleet market. In the executive sector, the Mercedes 190 is still widely regarded as the benchmark car. Its replacement, due to make its debut at the Geneva Show next month, is likely to retain the position, with its high capital cost so well offset by slow depreciation that it can cost less to run over, say, four years than an apparently cheaper car. The 3-litre and 4-litre V8 engines intended for the forthcoming new BMW 7-Series have replaced the in-line sixes in the current ones, making them even silkier. A BMW 730i V8 with 5-speed automatic transmission (or for that matter a two-pedal, 24-valve Mercedes 320E) must approach many executive car drivers' idea of perfection. Longer wheelbase Jaguar and Daimler Majestic models with 3.2-litre and 4-litre straight-sixes will not be available in the UK until the summer, though the long-awaited V12 engined XJ6 is due to go on sale in April. Meanwhile, a Daimler 4-litre may feel a bit soft around town but as speed rises, it becomes a real driver's car. It would please a business driver who loves a traditionally English car, wood veneered and trimmed in (and perfumed by) Connolly's hide whose board won't allow him to have a Bentley Brooklands. A trend in 1993 will be the increased availability of V6 engines in middle price range executive saloons. Among them are the Audi 100 and Volkswagen Vento, Vauxhall Cavalier and, before long, Saab 9000. A good alternative to a V6 of between 2.5 and 3-litres is a smaller turbocharged 4-cylinder. No-one has demonstrated this better than Saab. Despite - or perhaps because of - the recession, its turbocharged cars have sold exceptionally well. They, and recently introduced rivals such as the Citroen XM and Rover 800 with 2.0-litre turbocharged 4-cylinder engines, offer good economy when driven gently, with truly rousing performance on tap when required.</p>

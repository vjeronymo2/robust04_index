			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / International Company News: Warning by American Airlines hits sector shares US AIRLINE shares tumbled yesterday after American Airlines, one of the industry's three 'mega-carriers', warned that it expects to make a sizeable loss in the third quarter. American, one of the most tightly-run US carriers, is widely viewed as a bell-wether for the industry. Like most of its rivals, it has already reported losses for the second quarter, and for the first six months of 1992. American's warning came in a conference call between Mr Michael Durham, the company's finance director, and analysts. 'The industry environment continues to be extremely difficult,' said Mr Durham. He added that, although American's effort to rationalise fare structures had boosted traffic, yields were 'severely depressed'. 'As a result, we expect our third-quarter loss to exceed that of the second quarter, adjusted for the loss provision relating to the Confirm Reservation development project,' he said. In the second quarter, AMR - American's parent company - reported a loss of Dollars 166m after tax. Part of this deficit came from one-off items - including a Dollars 109m provision on Confirm, the now-suspended hotel and car reservation system project. But without these charges, AMR said it would still have posted a Dollars 48m after-tax loss. Mr Durham's comments suggest that the third quarter deficit will exceed this Dollars 48m figure.</p>

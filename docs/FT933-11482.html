			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Book Review: A forced and loveless marriage in Pretoria OPENING OF THE APARTHEID MIND By Heribert Adam and Kogila Moodley University of California Press, Dollars 25 It is sometimes hard for outsiders to reconcile the contradictory visions of South Africa which assail them in TV images and in newspaper headlines. There is the South Africa of the negotiating chamber, where the two main black and white parties are still co-operating to produce a new, democratic constitution ahead of the country's first multiracial elections next April. Then there is the other South Africa: a country of horrific violence and mounting social dislocation, of economic decline, political collapse and threats of civil war. To which country does the future belong? According to Heribert Adam and Kogila Moodley, a husband and wife team of sociologists, probably not altogether to either. In this book, they offer a more carefully nuanced portrait in which apartheid oppression is replaced not by true democracy but by a multiracial, but still authoritarian, oligarchy of the centre, challenged by similarly multiracial extremes of the left and right. For the foreseeable future, they argue, South Africa will be ruled by a self-selecting elite - black as well as white - in the name above all of law, order and economic development. The leadership of the African National Congress, in other words, will be happily co-opted into the existing structures of white power, dissenters crushed, and legitimacy sought through popular referendums if it cannot be secured through elections. Adam and Moodley, though now resident in Canada, have an impressive record as commentators on, and anticipators of, South Africa's political evolution. Adam's 1971 book, Modernising Racial Domination, accurately foresaw the changes in the ruling National party during the 1970s; in 1986 they predicted a historic accommodation between the Nats and the ANC. Their latest oeuvre, like its predecessors, is not an easy read. It is irritatingly full of sociology-speak (what, for example, is 'the abdicating relativism of the postmodernists'?) and its argument is poorly organised to a point which may deter the uninitiated reader. But it could well prove every bit as prescient. Indeed, in many respects the process it outlines is already well advanced: this is essentially what the ANC and the government mean when they talk these days of 'power-sharing'. Adam and Moodley describe their political alliance - the driving force of the multi-party talks - as a forced and loveless marriage. Just as neither could defeat the other in the 1980s, neither can rule without the other in the 1990s. That the people who matter on both sides recognise this fact is in itself remarkable. As the book shows in a lucid account of the road from confrontation to negotiation, it testifies to the Afrikaners' well-developed instinct for self-preservation. It was this instinct which prompted them to seek talks when international events (settlement of regional conflicts with the end of the cold war) and domestic pressures (the mounting costs of apartheid) were for the first time combining to make compromise seem both feasible and acceptable. 'Few ruling groups in history have ever wriggled themselves out of a deadly predicament more elegantly,' the authors observe. The wriggling is far from over yet, of course. The two sides, for all their procedural progress, have not been able to agree how to define power-sharing. Before elections will be conceivable, the ANC and the National party will have to reach a more precise understanding - preferably together with Chief Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party - on the powers of regional government. And even if the outstanding constitutional issues are resolved in time, it is open to doubt whether elections can happen while anarchy and violence still stalk the townships. The authors' scepticism about the prospects for democracy goes deeper than that. They wonder how, having secured a stake in power, ANC leaders will exercise it. They worry that high black expectations for change will rapidly clash with economic reality, and that the elite will sink into corruption. A persistently sluggish economy would worsen political tensions and exacerbate South Africa's manifold social ills; the result could be a multiracial class war between urbanised, employed 'insiders' and the dispossessed of the hostels and squatter camps. Such conflict, rather than tribal strife, say the authors, is one element in the current fighting between the ANC and Inkatha. As the country drifts further into ungovernability, restoring order will become the government's - any government's - top imperative: 'If a new suppression of white and black violent extremism were perceived as essential, a multiracial emergency coalition could crush opposition even more effectively than the old racial minority regime. After all, the ANC has tortured its dissidents and spies almost as gruesomely as the apartheid police.' Nevertheless, Opening of the Apartheid Mind suggests that none of the gloomy parallels most often sketched is quite accurate. South Africa is unlikely to suffer the mass exodus of white civil servants that afflicted Zimbabwe, for example, and in any case has a much more vibrant private business sector. Even under apartheid, it was a more integrated society than the former Yugoslavia; the hatreds between the majority of blacks and whites do not bear comparison with those between Serbs, Croats and Bosnian Moslems. On the contrary, the authors identify among South Africans of all colours a promising sense of common purpose that transcends the discredited group identities imposed by apartheid. In that lies perhaps the strongest reason to hope that South Africa is not doomed to become another African disaster story.</p>

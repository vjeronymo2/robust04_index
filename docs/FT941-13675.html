			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / London cabinet backs Patten over Hong Kong reforms The Hong Kong government will not proceed to the second stage of its electoral reform plans until the fate of a first bill, now before the Legislative Council, is clear, Mr Chris Patten, the governor, said yesterday. Mr Patten held consultations in London with a cabinet sub-committee including Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, on the future course of the governor's proposals to broaden the democratic franchise in the crown colony. The cabinet proffered strong support to Mr Patten, giving him discretion to decide, in consultation with Mr Hurd, on the content and timing of the second stage of the the reforms. Speaking after the meeting at Downing Street, Mr Hurd said that no decisions had been taken about the second bill, but that legislation had to be in place by July for elections in 1994 and 1995 to be held in an orderly way. Mr Patten said: 'We will obviously be deciding on which is the best way forward in the light of our success in getting the first bill through and other factors at the time.' The first bill covers issues said by Britain to be non-controversial. The proposals to which China most objects have been left for possible inclusion in the second. Mr Hurd and Mr Patten repeated a call for Beijing to resume negotiations which broke down in November after 17 fruitless rounds. China, which assumes sovereignty in 1997, says it will overturn reforms introduced without its agreement.</p>

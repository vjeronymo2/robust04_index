			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 24 (XINHUA) -- China is hoping for a  "package plan" to resume its signatory status in the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in the forthcoming 17th  working group conference and the talks to be held within this  year.    This was stated by Long Yongtu, assistant minister of  foreign  trade and economic cooperation, in an exclusive interview with  XINHUA today.    Long is leaving for Geneva tomorrow together with the  Chinese  mission to the 17th working group conference of GATT, headed by  Gu Yongjiang, vice-minister of foreign trade and economic  cooperation.    China attaches great importance to the 17th conference,  hoping to conduct wide-ranging consultations with other parties  on the "comprehensive file" governing China's resumption of its  signatory status in GATT. The file, prepared by the chairman of  the China group of GATT, has been distributed to other parties  for consideration.    "It is the first time in China's talks with GATT on its  status over the past eight years that a file on China has been  submitted to the conference by the chairman which contains the  contents of multilateral protocols," Long said. "This  represents an important step forward towards the resumption of  China's signatory status," he added.    Included in the comprehensive file is the gist of the  separate protocols submitted by the United States, Japan, the  European Community and other signatory parties. China had  separate bilateral consultations with the United States, Japan  and the European Community before they submitted these protocols.    However, Long noted, China should by no means  "underestimate"  the difficulties it might face in the coming talks.    China is still a developing country, Long said. Thus, in  balancing China's "rights and obligations" in realizing its  resumption of status in GATT, the relevant parties should take  into full account its practical conditions of economic  development, its ongoing domestic economic reform process and  the capability of the country as a whole to cope with the  required conditions, Long stressed.    China's efforts to resume its signatory status reflect  "mutual needs," Long said. "China needs the world trade  organization, but the organization without China would be  incomplete and less universal," he added.    To exclude China, one of the world's biggest countries, from  the organization "would itself be unfair," Long concluded.</p>

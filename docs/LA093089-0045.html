			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> APPLAUSE FOR BRAUDE DECISION  </P> <P> Braude's decision serves the best interests of the public by guaranteeing  needed fire protection, park access, traffic mobility and potential traffic  relief to Encino residents. His decisive position on a controversial issue  reflects courage.  </P> <P> Arguments that the Reseda extension and the needed paving of Mulholland Drive  will bring about hillside development and the activation of dump sites has been  refuted. Nearly all of the area around Mulholland Drive from Reseda Boulevard  to Encino Hills Drive, which would complete a commuter route, is publicly owned  so that there can be no private development. Councilman Braude states in his  letter to 800 individuals who had contacted him on the issue of the Reseda  extension that "Los Angeles County's getting a permit for a dump in Rustic and  Sullivan canyons is a political impossibility."  </P> <P> Now that the Reseda Boulevard-Mulholland Drive link will be built, we must  proceed to the task of paving Mulholland Drive to bring about traffic relief  and to open up opportunities for everyone to enjoy our parklands.  </P> <P> MADELINE DE ANTONIO  </P> <P> Encino  </P></p>

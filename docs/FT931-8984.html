			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Corruption probe spreads to senior Italian ministry officials TWO undersecretaries in Italy's Budget and Interior ministries were warned yesterday that they were under investigation for alleged corruption. The most prominent, Mr Claudio Lenoci, a Socialist at the Interior Ministry, is being investigated by Rome magistrates concerning alleged misuse of the Italian overseas aid programmes. Mr Lenoci, a parliamentary deputy since 1979, was previously in charge of the overseas aid programme at the Foreign Ministry. The other undersecretary is Mr Vito Bonsignore, a prominent Christian Democrat deputy from Turin. He is under investigation over a hospital contract in the Turin area. He issued a statement yesterday declaring his willingness to co-operate and denying any wrongdoing. The Turin magistrates' move follows the arrest of two senior politicians in the regional administration. In other developments in Italy's widening corruption scandals, Milan magistrates leaked details of their interrogation in a Swiss jail of Mr Florio Fiorini, the former finance director of ENI, the state oil concern. Mr Fiorini, who is charged with fraudulent bankruptcy, is alleged to have told the Italian magistrates ENI paid an annual L1.2bn (Pounds 540,000) to the main political parties throughout the 1970s. From 1970 to 1980, Mr Fiorini is said to have claimed, ENI paid L40m a month to both the Christian Democrats and Socialists, with a further L10m to each of the small Social Democrats and Republican parties. The ENI money, he claimed, derived from foreign exchange operations profits and had not affected ENI's finances. These alleged payments stopped in March 1981 following exposure of the P2 secret masonic lodge. Potentially more damaging in the Fiorini testimony were allegations that ENI and other entities channelled funds to the Socialist party via a bank account in Lugano. Until now Milan magistrates have only indicated they were examining this account, in the name of Mr Silvano Larini, a Milan architect arrested 10 days ago, for two alleged transfers totalling Dollars 7m from the late head of Banco Ambrosiano, Mr Roberto Calvi. The transfers were allegedly made to compensate Dollars 50m worth of loans said to have been provided by ENI to the troubled bank. Both Mr Bettino Craxi, who stepped down from the Socialist leadership last week, and Mr Claudio Martelli, who resigned the Justice portfolio, have been issued with warrants that they are under investigation concerning alleged illicit use of this account in the fraudulent bankruptcy of Ambrosiano. Mr Craxi was also told yesterday he was under investigation for alleged corruption concerning Milan's municipal energy authority. Mr Craxi has consistently denied wrongdoing.</p>

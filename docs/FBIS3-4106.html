The disgruntled  miners have become a threat to stability, a meeting of China's  main consultative organ was told yesterday.    A democratic party leader, Wu Jing, said about 78 percent of  workers, or 2.5 million, in the country's 94 major coal mines  did not receive wages from their coal industry bureaus. The  total amount of outstanding wages stood at 1.8 billion yuan  (HK$1.59 billion). Some coal industry bureaus owed workers more  than four months' back pay, said Mr Wu, a leader of the  Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, one of the  eight democratic parties. Mr Wu told the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference that this had caused a  critical drop in workers' living standards. "Elements of  instability in coal mines and petitions have increased," he  said. "There are more theft cases. The disgruntled workers  have worked to rule. The cases of reprisals and assault (by  workers against cadres) have gone up." He urged the various  ministries to help retrieve the debts owed by other industries.  Inconclusive statistics have put the debt total at 19.1 billion  yuan last year.    The "helping hand" given by central leaders last year to  grant emergency funds only managed to provide superficial  relief, he said. Mr Wu said the State Council should stop coal  suppliers to industries which failed to pay their debts to the  coal companies.    The democratic party leader also warned that unauthorised  coal mining activity in villages and townships had become  rampant, resulting in more industrial accidents and huge wastage  of coal resources. More than 80 per cent of the 68,000 coal  mines in villages and townships did not meet the Government's  safety standards, Mr Wu said. Aside from these, about 30,000  coal mines were illegal. Mr Wu said at least 2.4 billion tons  of coal had been wasted because of the chaotic tapping of the  resources by unauthorised coal mining companies.    A total of 3,697 people died in rural coal mines last year.  The cost for every one million tonnes of coal produced was 8.5  lives.    Senior Chinese leaders have promised to take immediate  action  to solve the problem of coal mine workers' wages at meetings  with National People's Congress' delegates from Jiangxi, one of  the major coal mine industry strongholds.</p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Trencherwood shares shed 5p to 7 1/2 p The share price of Trencher-wood, the USM-quoted housebuilder in talks with its bankers, fell from 12 1/2 p to 7 1/2 p yesterday after an announcement about the company's weakened financial position, writes Jane Fuller. It had already warned that its results for the year to October 31 would be worse than anticipated when it announced a Pounds 3.5m interim pre-tax loss. Yesterday it said it would have to make 'a substantial further downward revaluation' of properties and developments. The write-downs meant that the group's net assets had fallen to less than half the called-up share capital. This necessitated an extraordinary general meeting, which would be held on April 7. Last April, Trencherwood had Pounds 45.9m on-balance sheet debt compared with Pounds 19.5m shareholders' funds. Off-balance sheet loans amounted to Pounds 27.6m. It had breached loan covenants, but by August had renegotiated a Pounds 50m two-year facility with its bankers. It said conditions in the housing and commercial markets had shown no signs of improvement since then, and had deteriorated in some areas, contrary to expectations.</p>

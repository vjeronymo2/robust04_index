			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Arts: Today's Television BBC2's series of personal documentaries 'giving voice to the wisdom of years', Shaking The Heavens, is devoted this week to John Brookes (7.45). Though he enjoys nature, cricket, and Castle Cary, it is poetry, we are told, which has become such an important part of his life since he retired. Apart from the fact that it is about half an hour too long, and never really exploits its wide screen format (a characteristic virtually irrelevant on television anyway) there is nothing obviously wrong with Vincente Minnelli's 1956 cinema biography of Van Gogh, Lust For Life. Indeed, it provides Kirk Douglas with one of his more demanding roles and he is well up to the task. Yet, for me anyway, it never quite brings the agonised artist to life (8.30 C4). The fly-on-the-wall series, Town Hall, about the workings of Lewisham Borough Council has been fascinating from the start, but there has been a feeling throughout that something really dramatic is about to happen. Perhaps today, in the last of the series (9.45, BBC2), it will. We are told that the long-running argument over the budget comes to a head.</p>

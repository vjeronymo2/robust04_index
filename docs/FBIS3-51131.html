In his first visit to Cuba, Osman reaffirmed the UNDP's  desire to help Cuba enter the international market. The third  training course for Cuban experts offered by the UNDP has been  scheduled for this year.    Osman will be in Havana until Friday [14 January]. During  his visit he will meet with top Cuban Government officials.    Osman was born in Maputo, Mozambique, where he occupied  several ministries from 1975 to 1991, including the Ministries  of Finance and Mineral Resources; he also served as secretary of  state for coal and oil resources.    Meanwhile, Joachim von Braunmuhl, UNDP representative in  Cuba, told PRENSA LATINA that the training courses are aimed at  introducing local experts to more modern international business  and financial operations.    Toward that end, he added, the first training course was  held  in Cuba in 1991 and a second one in 1992 with the participation  of 280 economists from various parts of the country at a cost of  $200,000.    Now, Braunmuhl said, the third phase of the training on  international commercial and financial techniques has been  scheduled for Cuban experts who will transmit their knowledge to  other professionals in their respective provinces.    He announced that there are other UNDP projects related to  Cuba this year which are being coordinated, the details of which  will be known later on.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: German banks buy holdings in Buderus Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank have each bought 10 per cent of Buderus from Metallgesellschaft, the troubled industrial and mining group, Reuter reports from Frankfurt. Metallgesellschaft sold its 79.9 per cent stake in the heating appliances group in a placement which would lead to a cash injection of DM1.2bn, Deutsche Bank, its largest creditor, said earlier this month. Commerzbank's purchase of a 10 per cent stake 'arises from the long-standing business links between Buderus and Commerzbank', the bank said. Metallgesellschaft sold its Buderus stake as part of a restructuring after creditor banks to Metallgesellschaft agreed to a DM3.4bn (Dollars 2.1bn) rescue package at the beginning of this year. Mr Hermann Mund, chairman of Deckel Maho, the German machine-tool maker, said the company was not in danger of collapse and the group would emerge from bankruptcy, Reuter reports from Munich. 'The company will at all events continue in operation, probably with partners,' Mr Mund said. Possible partners include machine-tool makers Gildemeister and Traub.</p>

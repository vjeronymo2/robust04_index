			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 10 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu said Friday that former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's  planned visit to North Korea will not help settle the row over  its nuclear program.    Han made the remark at a supreme council meeting of the  ruling Democratic Liberal Party when he was asked to comment on  the news by Rep. Pak Chong-su. The minister said carter will  visit Seoul first on his way to Pyongyang.    "The former American president is making the trip as a  private person and there is no need to stop his Pyongyang  visit," he said. He explained that when Carter comes to Seoul,  he will be fully apprised of the government's position on the  seriousness of the situation.    Han said, "If Carter goes to Pyongyang, he will relay to the  North Koreans how serious the international situation is and  there will be serious consequences if North Korea does not  cooperate."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Despite the ongoing Angolan peace talks,  we are receiving reports of further bombardments. UNITA is  accusing the government troops of firing on Huambo again. The  spokesman for the UNITA delegation in Lusaka, Jorge Valentim,  has just told us what happened:    [Valentim] There was heavy bombardment by the government air  force from 1000 hours [0900 GMT] yesterday, in an unexpected,  irrational and blind way. Bombs were dropped everywhere in  waves, on houses. Many houses disappeared...    [Unidentified correspondent, interrupting] Have the  government armed forces or the Angolan Government acknowledged  these renewed attacks?    [Valentim] Well, there is no way they can deny these  attacks,  because there were international observers. These had to go to  the shelters too, including an American representative visiting  Huambo.    [Announcer] That was UNITA spokesman in Lusaka, Jorge  Valentim, speaking to us moments ago. He accuses the Angolan  Armed Forces of resuming bombardments on Huambo.</p>

			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUART MURDER IN BOSTON AND RACISM IN U.S.  </P> <P> I was thrilled to read the account in the Jan. 14 issue (View) describing the  accomplishments of Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall in winning victory  after victory for black people and the Constitution over the forces of hate and  bigotry. All Americans should be proud of the work that Marshall has done to  make this a freer and more democratic country.  </P> <P> Then I read Jackson's column. I am saddened at what the fight against racism  has degenerated into. Currently, an epidemic of drug use is threatening black  Americans as white racists never could. Does Jackson urge greater action to  combat the scourge of drugs? He does not. 167772161 Instead, he sticks his head  in the sand and says that drug addiction is primarily a white problem, and  calls for less effort to combat drugs in the black community.  </P> <P> Jackson is doing an extreme disservice to his own people. Were a white person  to advocate lessening protection of black people from drugs, he or she would be  denounced as a racist. Perhaps Jackson is afraid of encouraging prejudice if he  acknowledges the extent of the damage that drugs have made on the black  community.  </P> <P> I urge Jackson to support vigorous action to combat drugs and crime in all of  America. By opposing efforts in the black community to combat drugs, Jackson is  giving aid and comfort to those who would destroy the black community.  </P> <P> ROBERT E. PARK  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

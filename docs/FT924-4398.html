			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / International Company News: NTT bond issue aims to cut risk for investors NIPPON Telegraph and Telephone, the Japanese telecommunications company, is preparing to launch a straight bond issue this week of between Y50bn and Y100bn (Dollars 403m-Dollars 806m). The issue will use the fixed-price method, which will include some alterations intended to reduce risk for investors and activate the secondary market. The issue will be the first to be sold in Japan that allows investors to trade the bonds during the offering period. Under current market practice, investors are forced to hold bonds until the offering period is over, making bondholders vulnerable to market movements. NTT will also remove the call option clause, giving issuers the choice to redeem bondholders before maturity. The move will allow institutional investors to use corporate straight bonds as hedging instruments against government bonds. Last December, NTT launched Japan's first fixed price deal, paving the way for other Japanese companies to use the fixed price re-offering system in the domestic bond market. Mr Masaaki Nogawa, deputy general manager of NTT's finance and treasury division, said he hoped the new issue would enhance liquidity of the domestic secondary market, which is virtually stagnant. Domestic corporate bonds have traditionally been issued using the 'proposal method', where underwriting is awarded to the most competitive bid. The excessive competition for underwriting contracts led to unrealistic offering prices. Details of the deal, led by Nikko Securities and Morgan Stanley Japan, have yet to be decided, but NTT expects the amount to total between Y50bn and Y100bn depending on investor demand. The issue will have a maturity of seven to 10 years. See Capital Markets</p>

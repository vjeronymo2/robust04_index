			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THIEVES MARKET REBORN FOR CHARITY  </P> <P> What's a Thieves Market? A place to steal a bargain. Junk mixed with goodies. A  way to raise a charity dollar. And UCLA Art Council, with the revival of its  once-famous Thieves Market, this past weekend combined all that.  </P> <P> When the council launched its first Thieves Market in 1964, the event was a  co-production by Frances Brody and the late Palmer Ducommon. Within a few  years, the net had built to $290,000, making the biennial event one of the  city's biggest fund-raisers. It was a place to find whole sets of sterling,  antique chests and dining room tables with 12 chairs straight from the most  elegant confines of Hancock Park. Over the years, until 1982, the benefits  raised$1.75 million for UCLA art projects.  </P> <P> Then costs escalated. Trucking fees for merchandise pickup became prohibitive.  Finding free warehouses and sale locations became a problem. (Bekins Moving and  Storage and Gucci both contributed warehouse locations this year.) Garage sales  competed. Tax breaks made it much less attractive for donors to part with  treasures. And, seven years ago, the market was canceled.  </P> <P> In spite of it all, Art Council president Connie Nagler and co-chairs Marian  Mandel and Muriel Simkin decided to revive the legendary market for the  council's 35th anniversary. It got its send-off Friday evening with a preview  show for 600 (tickets $150) in a hangar at Santa Monica Airport donated by Judi  Barker, who moved out planes Wednesday for the merchandise that 800 Council  members had spent thousands of volunteer hours collecting, carting, cataloguing  and pricing.  </P> <P> Friday evening, the live auction conducted by Bob Abell wasn't always getting  top prices from an audience that had feasted nicely on Rococo-catered cuisine  and wanted to chat instead of bid. The touted 1926 Ford went for $3,200 of the  anticipated $10,000. However, with Angie Dickinson cajoling, the gold necklace  she modeled brought a favorable $6,500 from Stanley and Marian Brown.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the auction was expected to bring in nearly $60,000, and with the  public sale, held Saturday, a total net of more than $150,000 is predicted when  figures are tallied.  </P> <P> Many in the audience had been at the first Thieves Markets -- Jerry and  Virginia Oppenheimer, Judith and Dr. Franklin Murphy, Yvonne Lenart, Margot  Bamberger, Hannah and Edward Carter, Mabel and James Pollak, Carmela Speroni,  Rupert Allan, Lani Bernhard, Bob and Marilyn Ehrman, and Ann Straus.  </P> <P> Most walked out with treasures and gifts that included luncheons for two at the  Bullocks Tea Room. "It was a good revival," Nagler said. "I'm sure we'll do it  again."  </P></p>

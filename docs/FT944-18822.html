			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: BAe/VSEL A takeover of VSEL by British Aerospace, currently under discussion, would make industrial sense. VSEL's capacity to thrive as an independent warship manufacturer is limited. Its future hangs on winning the Royal Navy's Pounds 2.5bn contract to build the next batch of Trafalgar submarines. But it will have a hard job convincing the Ministry of Defence that it is large enough to bear the risks of a fixed-price contract. BAe would provide VSEL with the necessary size. Its international reach should also help in marketing VSEL's products overseas. A takeover would fit in with BAe's ambitions to extend its role as a military contractor from aviation to naval projects. So far, it has only a small position in naval systems. But the skills it has developed in managing complex aerospace contracts could be transferred to warships. The financial structure of the proposed deal also has appeal. By paying with its own shares, BAe would acquire the Pounds 320m of cash in VSEL's balance sheet and improve its gearing. Such financial engineering would amount to a disguised rights issue, but it should be one accomplished without a hefty fall in its share price. None of this means a deal will be clinched. The two companies could easily fall out over how much VSEL is worth. And it is possible GEC may wade in and spoil the party. That, though, looks unlikely. GEC still has ambitions to take a bigger slice of the UK defence industry. But its main target remains BAe, not VSEL.</p>

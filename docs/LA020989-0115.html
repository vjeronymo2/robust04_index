			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BONELLI PARK RULING LAUDED  </P> <P> Your headline, "Bonelli Park Development Suffers Setback," (Jan. 29), should  have read, "Local Communities Save Bonelli Park From Commercial  Overdevelopment," or something similar.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Miriam Vogel's ruling was the right one but  may yet be only a temporary halt to the county's determination to make its  parks self-supporting -- like Disneyland. In the 1970s, the entire western  section of the park was leased indefinitely to a private concessionaire for a  commercial recreation venture. Regardless of how people may feel about the  appropriateness of Raging Waters, it is open to the public only three months of  the year. Thus for nine months of every year this most beautiful section of the  park is locked off and inaccessible. Do we want more of this?  </P> <P> JERE FRENCH  </P> <P> Claremont  </P></p>

We have as a rule  lived to see elections and witness the triumph of true people's  power. Music plays, beer flows from buffets at polling stations,  women hastily line up for candy, and the candidates' families  say nothing apart from that the time has come for these people  to defend the interests of the masses.    Today a deputy's career is becoming more and more dangerous.    In this respect the Crimea and the events occurring on the  peninsula depict, as it were, in miniature the picture of  "Ukraine. Parliamentary Elections. March 1994." For two years  there have been promises to turn the Crimea into a hot spot, a  new Karabakh. It was predicted that the division of the Black  Sea Fleet would be a destabilizing factor. Or that Crimean  Tatar expansion would disturb the peace. But it was an event  sanctified by the republic's legislation that proved the last  straw. The Crimea decided to declare its own president. To be  more accurate, prominent political forces began dividing up  spheres of influence in what is indeed a prime piece of land,  strategically important by no means because of some rusty old  tubs known as a fleet.    Official Kiev tumultuously applauded the start of the  campaign. However, this could have been done with the idea of  warning "president number one" -- Nikolay Bagrov, chairman of  the Crimean Supreme Soviet, who had dared too often to take a  special, Crimean view on a number of state issues. When it  became clear that the Crimea under the tricolor of the Republic  Movement or the Russian Party was indeed running the risk of  steaming toward Russia, Bagrov's victory should have been  ensured at any price. Or there should at least been a return to  the starting positions and the elections ruled invalid. But a  new phenomenon put in an appearance: The Crimea was suddenly  swamped by hitherto unheard-of waves of banditry verging on  political terrorism. The militia generally either lost the  criminals' trail or arrived too late. In a short period the  chief medics at the "Sea Surf" and "Russia" sanatoriums died,  along with the head of a council of ministers directorate, the  director of the Kerch iron ore combine, the leader of the  National Movement of Crimean Tatars, and the head of the Black  Sea Fleet Press Center. Strangers attacked the parliament's  headquarters, fired shots at the office window of Leonid Grach,  leader of the Crimean Communists, and, to cap it all, carried  out the carnage with no quarter for women or children (I am  talking about the murder of Nikolay Bagrov's economic adviser,  Crimean Supreme Soviet People's Deputy Iskander Mamedov, two of  his guards, and the wounding of 10 people). The tragedies were  not consistently linked, but it all finally led a dead-scared  Joe Public to yell: "Enough! Enough!"    However, the situation has been blocked by another means  also. Immediately after it opened, the ninth session of the  Ukrainian parliament promptly amended Article 114 of the  Constitution. The Ukrainian president now has a basis for  rescinding acts adopted by the cabinet of ministers and central  organs of power, and similar decisions by Crimea's leadership  structures, if he finds them at variance with Ukraine's  fundamental or other laws or with his own edicts.    Rukh's central leadership was one of the first to issue a  statement regarding the inadmissibility of presidential  elections in the Crimea. Moreover, the document indicated that  the actual course of the campaign is dangerously hotting up the  sociopolitical atmosphere on the peninsula. Events soon showed  that active participation in the quite legitimate Ukrainian  Supreme Council election campaign that has just begun may also  lead to symptoms of "Crimean fever" (at least for the  opposition). During the night of 15-16 January two strange men  tried to break into the Rukh Secretariat after hitting the  janitor on the head with a pistol. A little later it emerged  that Secretariat leader Mikhail Boychishin had disappeared....    The day before the parliamentary session the president's  representatives in the localities and representatives of soviets  at all levels met in the Supreme Council conference room.  Nomenklatura factions squabbled among themselves, but they were  unable to determine which was the more senior in the face of the  coming, unpredictable elections, so they tried to reach a  compromise by supraconstitutional but peaceful means. They  adopted a unique draft law on power and self-government in  Ukraine.    In the future Ukraine will operate solely as a presidential  republic.</p>

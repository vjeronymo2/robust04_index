			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / US tries to calm Mideast tensions Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, tried to calm tensions between Syria and Israel yesterday after a weekend surge of violence on the Israeli-Lebanese border overshadowed his current Middle East peace shuttle. The renewal of Arab-Israeli violence comes in spite of dramatic recent peace moves between Israel and its neighbours, crowned today by the opening of a new Red Sea border between Israel and Jordan. Pro-Iranian Lebanese guerrillas of the Hizbollah killed two Israeli soldiers at the weekend in Israel's self-declared security zone in southern Lebanon and fired salvos of rockets into northern Israel which slightly wounded three children. The Hizbollah attacks came after Israeli jets bombed an apartment building in south Lebanon on Thursday killing seven people. Israel and Syria yesterday traded accusations. Syria said Israel had stepped up its military attacks in south Lebanon in order to sabotage Mr Christopher's efforts to break a deadlock in Israeli-Syrian peace talks. 'The escalation in south Lebanon is a firm proof that Israel is trying to direct a severe blow to the US efforts aimed at rescuing the peace process,' said the official Syrian daily Tishreen. 'The one who wants peace does not kill peace with bombardment and does not resort to destruction and massacres.' Israel earlier accused Syria of not preventing attacks by Hizbollah in southern Lebanon. 'It is clear the Syrians, if they want, are able to influence the Lebanese government to constrain the activities of Hizbollah,' said Gen Ehud Barak, Israeli army chief. 'Unfortunately, they don't want to do it until now. As long as they are not doing it we are determined to keep fighting.' Mr Christopher met Mr Rabin and Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, in Jerusalem before flying to Damascus yesterday where he held five hours of talks with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria. In Jerusalem, he said he had intervened to prevent an escalation of violence which 'underscores the need for a peaceful resolution of these problems'. Despite the hostilities he remained cautiously optimistic about making incremental progress in stalled Israeli-Syrian peace talks, which focus on a return of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights in return for peace. Israeli officials said Mr Christopher was pursuing possible detailed scenarios of the timetable and phases of an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan and what security measures, such as demilitarisation, would be taken at what stage. Publicly, however, Syria insisted that there would be no progress until Israel stated clearly that it would withdraw fully from the Heights. Mr Christopher will attend an Israeli-Jordanian border ceremony today, 3.5km north of Eilat.</p>

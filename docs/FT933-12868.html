			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Fears over IT tendering found CIVIL SERVICE computer specialists believe that contracting out government information technology work to the private sector will reduce the quality of the work and lead to a worse service for the public. A survey published today in Government Computing magazine found that 60 per cent of central government IT staff believe that contracting out would lead to lower-quality work, while 70 per cent say that it would be bad for standards of service and more than 80 per cent believe that data would be less secure. Companies bidding for Civil Service IT work believe these fears reflect uncertainty in the service over the protracted period needed to put work out to tender and to consider bids. Mr John Staples, director of public-sector sales at EDS-Scicon - the company leading one of the two consortia shortlisted for managing the Inland Revenue's IT function - said: 'Because of the government's policy of open procurement, people have a longer period of worry. Given the circumstances, this result is understandable.' The survey also found widespread concern among government IT staff over salaries, pensions and job security if IT moves to the private sector.</p>

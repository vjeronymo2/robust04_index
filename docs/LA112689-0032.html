			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KUSC'S REVISED FORMAT HAS GIVEN A REVISED FORM TO AT LEAST ONE LISTENER  </P> <P> Smith states that Mozart would love his new programming. Mozart, when playing,  would not abide a cough from an audience member. What makes Mr. Smith think  that he would appreciate hearing his works truncated or sandwiched between  jazz?  </P> <P> If Smith believes he can sucker a jazz lover into listening to Mahler he is  mistaken. His programming change can be likened to casting Disney characters in  a play by Eugene O'Neill.  </P> <P> If playing the best serious music of the past 500 years is a "narrow focus,"  let me forever remain narrow-minded.  </P> <P> DAVID SPIEL  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

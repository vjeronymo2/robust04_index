			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. ADMINISTRATION SUSPENDS DIALOGUE WITH ARAFAT'S PLO  </P> <P> The decision to suspend talks with the PLO as announced by President Bush is  commendable. How can we continue to communicate with an organization that does  not denounce terrorism enacted by a faction of its movement?  </P> <P> Now to be fair and equitable, courageous and objective, the President has to  suspend diplomatic relations with the government in Tel Aviv until Israel stops  shooting teen-agers, tear-gassing infants, breaking stone-throwers bones,  blowing up houses, deporting residents, silencing poets, starving villages,  financing illegal acquisitions and settling refugees in the occupied  territories.  </P> <P> The President knows that statehood does not legitimize terrorism. Stop the flow  of U.S. funds to Israel and see if Israeli officials will be motivated to call  the White House for peace talks.  </P> <P> ZAVEN KHANJAIN  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

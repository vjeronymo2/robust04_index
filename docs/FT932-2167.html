			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Books: Schlock of the new - Brian Wenham revels in some racy ruderies CULTURE OF COMPLAINT: THE FRAYING OF AMERICA by Robert Hughes Oxford Pounds 12.95, 203 pages ROBERT Hughes' critique of contemporary American culture is already a tearaway hit across the Atlantic. This Hughes - Australian-born historian and art critic of Time magazine - punishes wayward language with the punchy hostility his namesake Merv hurls down on sloppy batting. That apart, Hughes R. is a lot funnier, particularly sharp on any and all sign of whinging and whining. 'We want to create a sort of linguistic Lourdes, where evil and misfortune are dispelled by a dip in the waters of euphemism'. As a consequence, 'The range of victims available ten years ago  -blacks, chicanos, Indians, women, homosexuals - has now expanded to include every permutation of the halt, the blind, the lame and the short, or, to put it correctly, the differently abled, the other-visioned and the vertically challenged'. Hughes lays about him to left and to right as he expands the thesis into politics, literature, education, and finally into the art world he knows best. The patterns are all of a piece. 'The Gulf War taught us that bombing a place flat was 'servicing a target', or 'visiting a site', that bombing it again to make sure that not even a snake or a thornbush survived was 'revisiting a site'.' For Hughes such fastidious distancings have an inevitable pay-off in the Rushdie affair: 'At home in America it was the height of sexist impropriety to refer to a young female as a 'girl' instead of a 'woman'. Abroad in Tehran, however, it was more or less OK for a cabal of regressive theocratic bigots to murder novelists on State policy. Oppression is what we do in the West. What they do in the Middle East is 'their' culture.' Hughes finds that the new - and sloppy - thinking has chalked up its greatest successes in the area of history. So what Americans teach themselves about slavery is pickled in the prism of political correctness (sic]). 'The solitary guilt of Europe and America continues to haunt discussions of slavery. Africa, Islam and Europe all participated in black slavery, enforced it, profited from its miseries. But in the end, only Europe (including, here, North America) proved itself able to conceive of abolishing it. That we have so-called historians who are prepared to gloss over this fact strikes me as remarkable.' Americans' persistent inability to think straight and write plain causes Hughes endless and barbed grief, supporting his contention that intellectually the country is 'fraying' at the centre as well as at the edges. He reserves some of his sharpest deliveries for the end. Over the Mapplethorpe affair Hughes notes with caustic despair a critical colleague 'reflecting on one photo of a man's fist up his partner's rectum, and another of a finger rammed into a penis, and fluting on about 'the centrality of the forearm' and how it anchors the composition, and how 'the scenes appear to be distilled from real life', and how their formal arrangement 'purifies, even cancels, the prurient elements'. This is the kind of exhausted and literally de-moralised aestheticism that would find no basic difference between a Nuremberg rally and a Busby Berkeley spectacular, since both, after all, are examples of Art-Deco choreography'. The appetite is whetted for a new Hughes television series, American Visions, expected in a year or two. Meantime, we can revel in the racy ruderies of this book.</p>

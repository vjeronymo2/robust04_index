			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Nine new special research areas will be established  by the German Research Society (DFG) at the beginning of next  year. Three of these projects will be assigned to biology and  three to engineering; two pertain to the natural sciences and  one to economics. Thus, from 1 January 1994, the DFG will be  supporting 196 special research areas in 52 institutes of higher  education.    "Signal recognition and transfer on cell surfaces" will be  investigated by scientists at the Free University in Berlin, the  Max Delbrueck Center for Molecular Medicine, and the Institute  for Plant Genetics and Cultured Plant Research in Gatersleben.  This is intended to clarify the molecular basis of signal  recognition on the surface of cells, their transmission into the  interior of the cell and reactions stimulated in the process.  Inflammations, differentiation among embryos and the development  of tumors are closely linked with signal transmission.    Researchers at the two Munich universities and the Max  Planck  Institute for Biochemistry in the same city will investigate the  "molecular and bioorganic basis for secondary metabolism."  Secondary materials are considered to be those which are formed  by plants or microorganisms but which are not absolutely  necessary for their metabolism. They are characterized by  complex structures and are often used in pharmacy. Using modern  techniques it is hoped to shed light on their mechanisms and to  produce new therapeutically effective substances.    Scientists from the Max Planck Institute and the university  in Goettingen are participating in the third biological project  along with the Brunswick Technical University and the Hannover  Medical College. Their subject area, developmental biology, has  had an explosive career over the last 10 years: It has been  possible, using new techniques, to identify those genes which  control the development of an organism out of an egg cell. Now  the question is how the activity of the genes is regulated in a  particular developmental program. Investigations in various  animals ought to facilitate a general understanding of molecular  strategies and blueprints in the animal kingdom.    Researchers from the Hamburg-Harburg Technical University  and  the GKSS Research Center in Geesthacht plan to concern  themselves with an area of engineering which has been neglected  in this country, the "micromechanics of multiphase materials."  In view of the increasing need for innovative materials in  industry, knowledge about the inner mechanism of materials is  growing in importance. The behavior of metallic alloys,  ceramics, or plastics must be known so that they can meet safety  standards.    Two more special research areas in engineering have been  assigned to the Aachen Technical College. Ergonomists,  electrical engineers, and mechanical engineers will study  "autonomous production cells." In the process systems should be  developed which perform complex processes substantially  independently and without interruption. Human beings should once  again play an appropriate role in the factories of the future as  "machine directors."    The heart of the "integrative material modeling" project is  computer supported development of materials. Transcending the  traditional classification of materials, the program ranges from  the raw material to the finished components. The results will be  important not only for basic research but also for business,  since modeling is increasingly replacing expensive experiments  in the production of components.    A third special research area is being set up in Aachen.  This  deals with "asymmetrical syntheses using chemical and biological  methods." Too little attention has been paid to the fact that in  chemical syntheses "chiral forms" arise as mirror images of a  compound. These differ in their biological activity, e.g. in  medications or plant protection. One of the forms is unnecessary  or even dangerous. Thus techniques are being sought by which  pure natural substances and hormones can be produced.    Scientists at Leipzig University will study "molecules in  interaction with boundary surfaces." These surfaces control  processes which are important in nature and technology and mark  off functional spaces. Molecules change their characteristics  when they come in contact with boundary surfaces and  simultaneously have an effect on the behavior of the surfaces.  The explication of fundamental relationships is important for  new procedures in optoelectronics, sensorics, and informational  technology, and also for medicine and environmental research.    Economists and mathematicians from the Humboldt University  in  Berlin will apply themselves to the "quantification and  simulation of economic processes." In this study economic,  mathematical, and statistical procedures are to be combined to  evaluate the dynamics of economic processes.</p>

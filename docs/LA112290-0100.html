			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANNEXATION MEASURE WINS BY 50 VOTES  </P> <P> Who says a few votes don't count?  </P> <P> The day after this month's general election, Measure Q, a proposal to annex  more than 1,000 acres and 5,000 residents of the Pinetree-Timberlane area into  Santa Clarita, appeared to have passed by a slim 66-vote margin.  </P> <P> That margin became even slimmer when the Los Angeles County Registrar of Voters  reported Wednesday that Measure Q eked out a victory by only 50 votes, 1,170 to  1,120.  </P> <P> An election update released by the registrar a week after the election showed  Measure Q's lead cut to 48 votes, 1,109 to 1,061. That count had buoyed the  hopes of Bruce K. Bell, a Canyon Country resident who had spearheaded the  campaign against the proposal.  </P> <P> But in another update released Nov. 15, the margin had increased to 52 votes.  Bell was not encouraged and, at the time, said he doubted that Measure Q could  be defeated. Between Nov. 15 and Wednesday, his forces gained seven more votes,  but the pro-Measure Q camp received five more.  </P> <P> Bell, citing the expense, said Wednesday that he would not ask for a recount.  </P></p>

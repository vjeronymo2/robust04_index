			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMITTEE WILL IDENTIFY START OF RECESSION  </P> <P> A panel of private economists, used by the government to decide whether the  economy is officially in a recession, will probably pinpoint a month between  June and September as the start of the current downturn, the group said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> But the panel stopped short of identifying the exact start of a recession,  saying it was still too early to tell.  </P> <P> "It appears likely that the committee will identify a month between June and  September, 1990, as the peak of activity in the economy and the onset of a  recession," said the group.  </P> <P> "However, because many data are still preliminary, the committee has not made a  definite determination of the turning point," added the group, which is the  government's official arbiter of peaks and troughs in the business cycle.  </P> <P> In a statement, the panel of academic economists said output and employment in  the United States were falling.  </P> <P> But the committee will make a decision "only after the data show a sufficiently  long and deep contraction that the episode would be termed a recession even if  it were followed immediately by a strong upturn in the economy."  </P> <P> The seven members of the National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle  Dating Committee conferred Friday by telephone, after several members said a  recession had begun.  </P> <P> Members of the panel agreed a recession had probably started, but they had not  agreed on the exact month, said Victor Zarnowitz, emeritus professor of  economics at the University of Chicago and a panel member.  </P> <P> The committee is unlikely to confer again before the release of fourth-quarter  gross national product figures Jan. 25, Zarnowitz said.  </P> <P> The group defines recession as "a recurring period of decline in total output,  income, employment and trade, usually lasting from six months to a year and  marked by widespread contractions in many sectors of the economy."  </P></p>

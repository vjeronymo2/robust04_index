			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] President Rauf Denktas has declared that the  Greek Cypriot Administration leader, who does not want to  progress any further than the latest phase reached as a result  of the goodwill demonstrated by the Turkish Cypriot side, has  resorted to blackmail and bluffing in a bid to avoid  responsibility. Denktas reacted to Kliridhis' letters to U.S.  President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister John Major, in  which he threatened to resign if the UN Security Council adopts  a resolution on the continuation of the confidence-building  measures [CBM] process.    Denktas pointed out that Kliridhis wants to prevent the  facts  from being underlined in a new report because he realizes that  he cannot place all the blame on the Turkish Cypriot side. He  is openly engaging in blackmail and he is bluffing, Denktas  charged. Noting that the Greek Cypriot leader aims at taking  possession of Maras [Varosha] and not at accepting the package,  Denktas remarked that it is not difficult to understand why  Kliridhis is resorting to such blackmail.    From the outset, the Greek Cypriots criticized Kliridhis for  consenting to negotiate the CBM's, and Kliridhis, in turn, told  members of the Greek Cypriot National Council to await the  outcome of the talks and then make a decision, Denktas recalled.  He said that Kliridhis wanted to secure a certain amount of  maneuverability to acquire Maras, and failing that, he wanted to  pave the way for membership in the European Union.    Denktas continued: Now, in his letters to Clinton and Major,  Kliridhis has announced that if the 21 March document is not  adopted in its present form, he will resign and will allow the  newly elected president to decide on the CBM's without  prejudice. Pointing out that this is the key point, Denktas  noted that Kliridhis wants to avoid responsibility.    The president recalled that in his recent report, the UN  secretary general referred to the 21 March document as a draft  of ideas, adding that it is not sincere and constructive for  Kliridhis to ask to sign a draft document without any change.  For the draft to turn into a full agreement, it is necessary to  include in the document those issues promised to the Turkish  Cypriot side and to present the text of the agreement to the  people as a whole.

			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THESE BLUE LINE RIDERS STILL SEE RED;  </P> <P> TRANSIT: THEY FONDLY REMEMBER THE DAYS OF THE RED CAR, WHEN LOS ANGELES -- AND  THEY -- WERE YOUNG.  </P> <P> The Blue Line may be an air-conditioned technological wonder, but it was having  a tough time wrestling with the ghost of the Red Cars on Saturday as riders of  Los Angeles' old transit system turned out to size up its new one.  </P> <P> Finding someone to malign Mother Teresa might have been easier than eliciting a  disparaging word about the old Pacific Electric Red Car that took its last  mournful trip from Los Angeles to Long Beach, black flags waving, on April 9,  1961.  </P> <P> The trains clacked like thunder and the conductor had to throw sand on the  tracks for traction.  </P> <P> But memories were selective as Los Angeles residents fondly recalled a line  where servicemen slept, riders fell in love and 34 cents would get you to the  Santa Anita race track. It was more than another transit line, it was another  time.  </P> <P> "A guy could go on there and go to sleep and nobody would rob you. Someone in  the crowd would always wake you up to tell you when your stop was coming," said  Tony Merriweather, who rode the Los Angeles-Long Beach route as an 18-year-old  sailor in 1948. "Today, you can't speak to people. I drive by people all the  time with their car doors half open and babies hanging out and you honk and  they just speed up. Nobody talks to you."  </P> <P> It's been 29 years since the last Red Car left Los Angeles with 50 people on  board at 1 a.m. that April day in 1961.  </P> <P> "The passengers sang 'I've Been Workin' on the Railroad' and we arrived in Long  Beach in the wee hours of the morning," said Alan Fishel, a transit buff who  took the last ride at the age of 19 and waited in the heat Saturday for the  debut of the Metro Blue Line. "We set out flares and watched the train roll  away through the smoke and into the dawn. People cried, they really did."  </P> <P> A few cars went to the museum; Los Angeles dove into its love affair with the  automobile, and the Red Car faded from the public's memory. Lately, however,  thousands of loyal followers have emerged with as many theories about the  demise of what once was considered the nation's finest rail system.  </P> <P> "I was real mad when they took away my Red Car," Bellflower resident Gene Bird  grumbled. "And I know who did it -- Firestone tires, Standard Oil and General  Motors. I've been buying Fords ever since."  </P> <P> "It was the stupid Times Mirror Co.," said Ruby Deem of Alhambra, who used to  ride the line to work at the phone company. Today, her old stop is a BMW  dealership. "They never wrote a good word about the Red Car and that was the  best system in the whole wide world."  </P> <P> At 6:15 a.m. on July 4, 1902, 30,000 people came to town on horseback, bicycle  and foot to see the Red Car take off from Los Angeles to Long Beach.  </P> <P> On Saturday, almost 88 years later to the date, tens of thousands braved  scorching heat, their heads covered with towels and handkerchiefs, to welcome  not only the new Blue Line but the end of a Los Angeles transit standstill  three decades long.  </P> <P> The new line, like the old, runs from Los Angeles to Long Beach. And that,  riders concluded, is where most similarities end.  </P> <P> "This has more buttons than a 747," said Jim Deem, a former Red Car motorman  who drove a Pasadena line in 1946 and sat for a moment behind the wheel of one  of the sleek blue-and-white trains.  </P> <P> The old trains were equipped with an air brake handle, an accelerator, a lever  to spit sand on the tracks and a "dead man's switch" that stopped the car if  the driver dropped dead. Untimely death and kids throwing rocks were about all  the dangers Red Car drivers ever considered, Deem said.  </P> <P> The Blue Line trains, on the other hand, are coated to resist graffiti,  equipped with special alarm systems, patrolled by Los Angeles County sheriff's  deputies and hooked up to a cement and glass command post known as the "USS  Enterprise."  </P> <P> Minimum fare on a Red Car was 10 cents, and provisions for senior citizens and  the disabled weren't even considered. On the Blue Line, it's $1.10; seniors  ride for half-fare and the blind ride free.  </P> <P> The red line rolled through orange groves and alfalfa fields. The blue one  offers a sobering view of some of the poorest neighborhoods.  </P> <P> The old line was part of 1,100 miles of track that traversed four counties with  access to the mountains and the sea. The Blue Line is the first leg of a system  that, once finished, will stretch 150 miles -- paltry by comparison, most  riders agreed.  </P> <P> "The Blue Line will never replace the Red Car and all the memories it holds for  me," said Merriweather, now an instructor supervisor for the Southern  California Rapid Transit District, which runs the new rail. "The seats might be  more comfortable now, but it was the clackety clack of the Red Car tracks that  put me to sleep."  </P> <P> Reminiscence aside, Red Car loyalists vowed to ride the new line.  </P> <P> "Absolutely," said Gene Bird. "My nerves can't take the traffic. And the air --  I used to wake up in L.A. and see the clear blue skies and it felt good to be  alive. Now, you feel like you're ready to let someone lay you down and bury  you. It's been a long time coming."  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLICE UPSET AT DECISION ON NOISY PARTY;  </P> <P> SOUTH PASADENA: PROSECUTORS DECLINE TO CHARGE FOUR MEN, INCLUDING CITY  MANAGER'S SON, OVER LATE-NIGHT BASH.  </P> <P> Prosecutors have decided not to file charges in connection with a noisy  drinking party that ended in the arrests of four young men, including the city  manager's son, but the hangover from last month's bash throbs on.  </P> <P> Although the late-night gathering of 30 to 40 young adults might have annoyed  some residents of this small, well-to-do community, there was insufficient  evidence to charge the suspects with disturbing the peace, head Deputy Dist.  Atty. David R. Disco said this week.  </P> <P> "Our focus is whether the conduct at that party was criminal . . . and in my  judgment, we could not establish that in this case," Disco said. "We can't be  the arbiters of what makes good neighbors."  </P> <P> The South Pasadena Police Officers Assn., already upset that a private  investigator has been hired by the City Council to look into allegations of  police misconduct at the party, reacted angrily to the decision.  </P> <P> "This was a case of a bunch of spoiled brats with some connections who wanted  to continue their party when the officers asked them not to," said Sylvia E.  Kellison, the police association's attorney. "Unfortunately, I guess this means  there's a different standard of justice for children of politicians than for  the average citizen's kids."  </P> <P> On Monday, the officers' anger spilled over into the 42nd State Assembly  District race, in which South Pasadena Mayor Evelyn Fierro is challenging  incumbent Richard Mountjoy.  </P> <P> By hiring an outside investigator to probe police handling of the incident,  Fierro "has become a symbol of defiance . . . for the youth of the community  and, inadvertently, has become a champion of teen-age drinking rights," the  association charged, throwing its endorsement to Mountjoy.  </P> <P> Fierro fired back Tuesday, calling the officers' reaction "typical of  police-state tactics."  </P> <P> "I will not be threatened to ignore alleged violations of any citizen's civil  and constitutional rights," she said in a prepared statement.  </P> <P> None of the four South Pasadena men arrested Sept. 14 in the 1100 block of  Stratford Avenue was available for comment on the district attorney's decision.  They are John Bernardi Jr., 22, son of the city manager; Bryan Lee Prentiss,  22, son of the former mayor; Thomas D. Ramos, 20, son of the former Chamber of  Commerce president; and Scott D. Josephson, 21.  </P> <P> All have been cleared in the incident except for Prentiss, who faces one count  of destroying public property for allegedly kicking a telephone off the wall  while being held in South Pasadena jail and stomping it into little pieces.  </P> <P> "I was just trying to dial 411," Prentiss explained to officers, according to a  copy of the police report obtained by The Times.  </P> <P> Almost immediately after the party, Bernardi's son filed a citizen's complaint  of police officers' excessive force; the City Council hired the $50-an-hour  investigator; the police charged political meddling, and Police Chief William  Reese announced his retirement.  </P> <P> For a while, there were so many rumors, leaks and accusations that the South  Pasadena Review declared in an Oct. 10 editorial: "Back in the days of World  War II, there was a Navy poster of a sailor whispering, 'Loose Talk Sinks  Ships.' . . . Today we need a poster that says, 'Loose Talk Can Sink Cities.' "  </P> <P> But on Wednesday evening, the talk was expected to continue. The police  association was slated to appear before the City Council with complaints that  nearly $20,000 in city time and money has been spent on what officers say is a  senseless investigation.  </P> <P> Although a final report has not yet been completed, the police association  attorney contended that the nine officers interrogated in the course of the  investigation have been cleared of any wrongdoing and that allegations by  Bernardi's son of police misconduct have all been refuted.  </P> <P> "In the five years that I've been an attorney for police officers, I have never  seen such an insignificant incident generate so many hours of interrogation,"  said Kellison, who represents more than 100 police associations in Southern  California. "There's been officer-involved shooting investigations that have  taken less time than this."  </P> <P> Officers were first called to the Ramos family's wood-and-stone home about  10:15 p.m. by a retired couple living next-door, but a patrolman cruising by  the house did not hear any disturbance and continued on his rounds, according  to the 10-page police report.  </P> <P> The couple called police again at 11:25 p.m., complaining of loud music and  shouting coming from the party. This time, officers entered through a rear  patio, where they found several dozen young adults, and many containers of beer  and wine scattered about, the report said.  </P> <P> Officers say they asked Ramos to reduce the noise, but maintain that he ignored  them and that the party continued unabated.  </P> <P> "Ramos and Bernardi both challenged the right of the officers to be there and  said the police had no authority to restrict their speech or freedom," the  report said. "Bernardi threatened to call his father if we did not leave the  premises. Despite further warnings that he would be arrested, Ramos went back  into the house to continue the party."  </P> <P> Officers followed Ramos into the kitchen and arrested him, sparking an outburst  by other party-goers, who allegedly surrounded the officers and shouted that  the police had no right to arrest their friend.  </P> <P> The other three suspects were arrested after they allegedly ignored continued  warnings from the police to leave the party and go home, the report said.  </P> <P> Disco, the head deputy district attorney, said no charges were filed primarily  because "loud and unreasonable noise" is defined under state law as noise that  incites violence or creates a clear and present danger, not merely a racket  that keeps neighbors up at night.  </P> <P> "I don't mean to endorse the specific party or gathering," he said, "but based  upon the facts, we can't establish that the noise was such that it would create  a clear and present danger."  </P></p>

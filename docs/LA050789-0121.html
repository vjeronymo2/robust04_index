			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Soviet poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko says the CIA helped the KGB clamp down on  Soviet dissidents in 1966 in order to divert world attention from the U.S.  bombing of Vietnam. In an article in the Soviet weekly Ogonyok, Yevtushenko  recounts how Sen. Robert F. Kennedy (D-N.Y.) told him that the U.S.  intelligence service had given its Soviet rival the pseudonyms of dissident  writers Yuli Daniel and Andrei Sinyavsky. Both were prosecuted with alleged CIA  evidence. Yevtushenko wrote he learned of the alleged CIA involvement when he  was invited to the senator's New York headquarters during a visit to the United  States in November, 1966.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> YOUNGSTERS GO FOR THE GOLD IN GOOFINESS  </P> <P> Ushica Hall may never play golf again.  </P> <P> The 7-year-old hit her ball inch by inch Thursday across 12 feet of turf. The  trouble was, the golf club was her nose.  </P> <P> "I don't like it," she said. "It's too hard."  </P> <P> The occasion was Santa Ana's sixth annual Wacky Olympics, in which 150 children  ages 6 to 12 competed for ribbons and prestige at El Salvador Park.  </P> <P> Put on by the city's Recreation and Community Services Agency, the Wacky  Olympics gives out-of-school kids the chance to participate in seven unorthodox  sports, such as the golf-ball race, a balloon toss, an obstacle course, a  peanut toss and a one-legged long jump.  </P> <P> "It's based on the Olympic-style events," organizer Pearl Soria said. "We try  to make it as wacky as possible. They are Olympic-type events done in a wacky,  fun way."  </P> <P> The event, which drew children from 10 of the city's parks and recreation  centers, gives youngsters a chance to meet others from throughout Santa Ana.  </P> <P> In some ways, the game mirrors the real Olympics. The opening ceremonies  featured a parade, with teams representing mock countries such as Mad Ball  City, the Jordan Jungle and the Arabian Nights. "Batman" was well represented  by the Gotham City and Bat Land teams.  </P> <P> The Wacky Olympics even included the traditional running of the torch -- a  construction cone -- and a special oath. But the pomp and pageantry did not  detract from the real reason the kids were there.  </P> <P> And before the competitors got too antsy, Soria declared: "Let the wackiness  begin."  </P> <P> There was the obstacle course, in which competitors had to crawl through  tunnels, run over tires and slide down a water-soaked plastic sheet.  </P> <P> Amado Nuncio, 10, was the first to make it through the course in a little more  than 10 seconds.  </P> <P> "When we get to the third cone, then we dive," he said, his hair and shirt  dripping with water. "It's fun when you go slipping."  </P> <P> At the peanut toss, in which upright competitors get three tries to see how far  they can throw peanuts back through their legs, kids had high hopes.  </P> <P> "I want to be famous," said Stephanie Rosas, 10, after tossing a nut several  yards.  </P> <P> The golf-ball race seemed to have the toughest rules.  </P> <P> "Nose, nose, no head!" shouted supervisor Carolyn Jimerson as Gary Sabara, 10,  crawled along the grass.  </P> <P> The rules might have been tough, but Gary still had more success than most. He  finished the race in 43 seconds, way ahead of Ushica and other competitors.  </P></p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Boost from IBM news offset by late selling Wall Street US STOCK markets advanced strongly in early trading yesterday, buoyed by relief that IBM's decision on a dividend cut has been made, and also by hopes of lower interest rates in Europe, but a late sell-off trimmed the gains to a minimum by the close, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally just 6.75 up at 3,298.95, well below the day's peak of 3,320.03. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 moved in similar fashion but ended 0.06 off on the day at 439.95. The American SE composite finished 2.08 higher at 411.60, while the Nasdaq composite settled only 0.21 ahead at 707.16, although another record close. Trading volume on the New York SE was a heavy 314m shares. Following Monday's sharp advance, analysts were not surprised by the markets finally pausing to consolidate gains yesterday. Prices initially strengthened from the opening, helped by a number of positive factors. Overnight news of a cut in UK interest rates was greeted warmly. Economists in the US said they hoped the cut might persuade the Bundesbank to lower German interest rates, which would be good for European economies as a whole and boost demand for US exports to the region. Domestically, news of a 5 per cent rise in December existing home sales also lifted sentiment, as did IBM's decision to cut its quarterly dividend by more than half. The market, which has been waiting for IBM to move on its dividend for weeks, was also pleased by the announcement that the group had begun a search for a new chief executive to replace the much-criticised Mr John Akers. IBM added more than Dollars 3 in early trading, before falling back to end only Dollars  1/8 up on balance at Dollars 49 in volume of 6.3m shares. Other leading stocks were boosted by news of strong earnings. Walt Disney rose Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 46 3/8 in busy trading after the entertainment group announced late on Monday fiscal first-quarter profits of Dollars 260m, or 48 cents a share, well up from the Dollars 208m, or 39 cents a share, earned at the same stage a year ago. BankAmerica was also higher following quarterly results and its shares advanced Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 53 1/2 after the banking group announced that fourth-quarter net income totalled Dollars 473m, about the same as in the previous quarter. Analysts said that while the earnings were in line with expectations, the market was pleasantly surprised by the small increase in intangible assets during the quarter. American Express bucked the market-wide trend, falling Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 24 in volume of 6.4m shares as investors registered their disappointment at the news that Mr James Robinson was staying on as chairman of the troubled travel and financial services group. The shares had risen in recent weeks on hopes that Mr Robinson would soon be replaced. Merck weakened Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 39 1/2 in heavy trading after the large drugs group announced slightly disappointing fourth-quarter results. Canada TORONTO share prices ended higher, following the trend set in most major world markets yesterday. The TSE 300 index gained 17.2 at 3,312.8 and advances outscored declines by 348 to 293 after volume of 43.5m shares valued at CDollars 523.3m. The golds and industrial products sectors recorded the biggest gains, of 2.34 per cent and 1.82 per cent respectively. Northern Telecom reported higher fourth-quarter and annual earnings. The stock jumped CDollars 3 7/8 to CDollars 57 7/8 .</p>

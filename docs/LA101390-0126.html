			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> PROP. M PICKS UP BACKING  </P> <P> The campaign for Measure M, the proposed half-cent sales tax for traffic  improvements that is on the Nov. 6 Orange County ballot, picked up a  symbolically important endorsement this week from the League of Women Voters.  </P> <P> The league previously had been silent on Measure M, partly because of a split  membership, according to some of the group's members.  </P> <P> "We have agreed to allow our name to be used in campaign literature as a  supporter," league President Patricia C. Harrigan said. "However, we will not  be taking an active part in the campaign."  </P> <P> Measure M supporters conceded Friday that the league's endorsement carries with  it no particular bloc of voters, but said it may impress some people who hold  the organization in high esteem because of its reputation for issuing factual,  nonpartisan analyses of ballot issues before elections.

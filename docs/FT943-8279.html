			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / OFT plan to reduce credit card protection attacked Credit card holders could lose out under the reforms of consumer credit proposed by the Office of Fair Trading, the Consumers' Association warns in a report published today. The association attacked the new limits recommended by the OFT within which card issuers should be liable for goods or services misrepresented or not delivered. It released a poll showing that customers value the protection. The survey, by opinion pollsters BRMB, found that seven out of 10 of those with credit cards knew that using a card provided some protection if goods bought proved faulty. Once it had been explained to those who had been unaware of it, almost two-thirds of the total rated the protection as very or fairly important. The removal of credit providers' joint and several liability was one of the recommendations from the deregulation taskforces set up by the Department of Trade and Industry. In June the OFT concluded that the protection should remain, but within slightly narrower limits. It said the minimum transaction for which it would apply should be raised from Pounds 100 to Pounds 150, while the upper limit should be set at Pounds 25,000 rather than Pounds 30,000. Ms Jean Eaglesham, the association's head of money policy, said it was 'iniquitous to raise the lower limit while lowering the upper limit', particularly as the average credit card purchase was just Pounds 40. The OFT said the rise in the lower limit, the first since 1985, would be in line with keeping the liability to relatively high-priced goods and services. It did not believe significant transactions currently protected in law would be excluded by the fall in the maximum.</p>

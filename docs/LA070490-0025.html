			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ROMANIA;  </P> <P> 83 WILL STAND TRIAL IN POLITICAL VIOLENCE  </P> <P> Romania said that at least 83 people will stand trial for involvement in  political violence in Bucharest.  </P> <P> Officials asserted that the six people killed in the June 13-15 riots died  before pro-government miners arrived on the scene. A Foreign Ministry statement  also absolved security forces of responsibility for three people who died of  gunshot wounds, saying the troops used only blanks. The statements appeared to  be part of a campaign by Prime Minister Petre Roman's government, sworn in  Tuesday by President Ion Iliescu, to repair the damage caused to Romania's  international reputation by the riots.  </P></p>

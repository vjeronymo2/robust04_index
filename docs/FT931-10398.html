			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / NatWest cuts 4,000 staff as high street bank job losses rise NATIONAL Westminster Bank is to cut about 4,000 jobs, mostly from its branch network, taking the number of jobs to be lost in high street banks this year to at least 10,000. National Westminster said it expected only a 'minimal' number of compulsory redundancies this year because cuts would be spread across a wide number of grades. Last year it dismissed 1,500 staff compulsorily out of a total loss of 5,500 jobs. Other banks expecting to shed jobs this year because of new technology, branch closures and recession include Barclays, which is expecting to lose 3,000 jobs, and Royal Bank of Scotland, which is cutting 3,500 posts by 1995. More banks are expected to make cuts over the course of the year. Mr Stuart Chandler, NatWest's general manager for human resources, said changing technology and cost pressures meant job levels would be cut further in coming years. 'This process will continue for some years ahead,' he said. The announcement was criticised by unions, which will meet the bank today to discuss the cuts. However, the NatWest Staff Association, which represents 41,000 NatWest staff, said it welcomed the bank's assurance that there would be fewer compulsory redundancies. National Westminster, which employs 95,000 staff, 63,000 in its branch network, has been attacked by unions for selecting staff for redundancy by comparing individuals' job performance, disciplinary record and attendance. About 3,200 jobs are expected to go in the branch network, 600 in the group services division which handles technology, and 250 jobs in the NatWest Markets investment bank, of which 150 will be in NatWest Markets' British operations. Unions have pressed NatWest to establish a register of people willing to take voluntary redundancy, but Mr Chandler said the bank would 'use every means at our disposal to avoid compulsory redundancy short of a voluntary register'. Mr Martin Gray, head of branch banking, said there were likely to be few compulsory redundancies because cuts would affect a larger number of managers as well as clerical staff, and so there would be more early retirements.</p>

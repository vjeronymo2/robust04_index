			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 28 Apr (PL) -- Vice Foreign Relations  Minister Isabel Allende today said the harassment of Cuban  lawyer Magda Montiel for attending The Nation and The Emigrants  Conference in Havana is "totally irrational."    In exclusive statements given to a national television  newscast, Allende said: "These actions warrant only repudiation,  which is the only word I can use, because I see no reason to  harass Magda Montiel in this manner."    She said this treatment is unbefitting behavior for  civilized  and normal human beings, adding that such treatment will fail to  eclipse the results of "The Nation and the Emigrants"  Conference, which took place on 23 and 24 April, thanks to local  authority initiatives.    Allende pointed out: "I personally think such behavior can  in  no way prevent what was accomplished in the conference from  materializing; I believe this conduct will shadow those who  behave in such a manner."    Montiel and other citizens of Cuban origin who live abroad,  mainly in the United States, are the target of aggression and  harassment by extreme rightists in exile who oppose the renewal  of relations between the island and its expatriate nationals.    The harassment of Montiel, an American citizen and former  congressional candidate for the Republican Party, began upon her  return from Havana, because Miami television stations aired  footage showing Montiel talking with President Fidel Castro  during a reception he held for conference attendees.    Isabel Allende recalled that members of the emigrant  community, whom she called annexionist [anexionista] emigrants,  tried to obstruct the Havana conference, which had been  requested on many occasions by Cuban nationals living in many  other countries.</p>

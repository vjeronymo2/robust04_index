			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 6 April Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] At a 3 April dinner, Prime Minister Hosokawa made a  remark indicating his wish to resign.    Commenting on the prime minister's remark while speaking  with  a group of reporters early in the morning of 6 April, Deputy  Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Hatoyama said: "The prime  minister made the remark at a dinner. He made the statement  from his position as a civilian, not as prime minister. He is  used to speaking his mind to others." But Hatoyama added: "As  prime minister, he made a reckless remark. I believe he did not  make that statement even jokingly."</p>

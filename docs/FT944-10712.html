			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Glencore buys back Rich holding in group Glencore International has bought back for cash the final 25 per cent stake in the diversified trading and industrial group held by Mr Marc Rich, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. Glencore, formerly Marc Rich &amp; Co, agreed in March 1993 to buy out Mr Rich's 51 per cent stake in the business over a five-year period. Mr Willy Strothotte, chairman of the employee owned group, said he was very pleased that the ownership transition had been completed much more quickly than planned. No price was given for the transaction, but the group's capital prior to Mr Rich's withdrawal was believed to be in the range of Dollars 1bn. The shares will be sold among the group's 5,000 employees. Mr Rich has resigned from the boards of Glencore and its quoted Swiss subsidiary Sudelektra.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers </F> Takes Extreme Measures: The Valves Will Be Shut for Those  Institutions Which Willfully Fail To Pay for Imported Gas"]    [Text] Several forewarnings from the Ukrainian  government with regard to introducing sanctions for non-payment  for imported gas have been put into effect. In accordance with  the government's decisions, beginning on 10 April 1994, those  enterprises which have failed to pay for energy sources will not  receive a single cubic meter of gas.    Decree No. 196 of the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers "On  Settling An Enterprise's Accounts for Natural Gas" may be  summarized as follows.    The gas-supplying enterprises of Derzhkomnaftogaz [State  Committee on Oil and Gas]--Ukrgazprom and Ukrgaz--will become  the organs responsible for carrying out this decree. The reason  for applying such harsh measures lies in the fact that previous  demands by the government regarding the introduction of  prepayment for delivery of natural gas supplies and restriction  on the distribution of gas to those consumers who fail to pail  their gas bills on time have not, in fact, been carried out. And  it was only in March 1994 that organs of the Ukrainian  Derzhkomnaftogaz implemented a series of measures which  compelled enterprises of the Ministry of Industry and the  Ministry of the Macine-Building Industry--the greatest consumers  of energy for production purposes--to begin paying back their  debts. On the other hand, the Derzhkomnaftogaz cannot stop gas  deliveries to many of its consumers (even to those which  chronically fail to pay their gas bills) without thereby risking  a complete disruption of the technological processes at these  enterprises--something which could cause breakdowns or even  accidents.    The latest government decree on putting a stop to gas  deliveries allows the Derzhkomnaftogaz to proceed to completely  shut off the supply of gas if the debtors fail to settle up by  10 April. Moreover, the responsibility for the consequences of  applying such measures shall be borne by the leading officials  of the debtor-enterprises involved. In such situations the  enterprises' leading officials will have to draw on their own  hard-currency accounts, including those in foreign banks.  Shutting off gas deliveries does not apply, however, to  enterprises of the public-utilities sector, which are financed  on accounts of the state budget. Moreover, the above-mentioned  decree is the latest step in the government's consistent program  for compelling Ukrainian enterprises which produce goods  suitable for export to take part in paying for the import of  Russian energy sources.    In the opinion of representatives of Ukrgazprom and Ukrgaz,  the latest change in the system of settling consumers' accounts  (partly or sometimes by consumers making prepayments for  deliveries on a contractual basis) and accounts for gas-93 will  allow the Derzhkomnaftogaz to accumulate funds for settling  accounts with Russia within quite a short period of time. All  the more so in that its own previous decrees had already  demanded that bills be paid in hard currency from those of our  country's enterprises which have it in their bank accounts.    The new scheme set forth by Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers  for settling accounts with Russia could be called "a la Nordex."    In order to speed up the introduction of a mechanism of  reciprocal clearing accounts with the Russian gas-suppliers, the  Ukrainian government has adopted a schem for covering its debts  by means of bartering goods through a fully authorized middleman  or intermediary--the Ukrzakordonnaftogaz Association. According  to this scheme, the consumer-enterprises will be able to pay  their bills into the Ukrgazprom account, using Ukrainian  karbovantsy to do so; and the Gazprom will immediately channel  these karbovantsy into an account of the Ukrzakordonnaftogaz.  The latter will buy a certain quantity and assortment of goods  in Ukraine (those on a list approved by the above-mentioned  decree) for karbovantsy and then sell them to Russian  enterprises for rubles, thereby obtaining funds to pay for  Russian gas. Formerly the Ukrgazprom on its own had to buy  Russian rubles or hard currency at the exchange rate set by the  National Bank; moreover, it was far from always successful in  finding the necessary sum.    To a large extent, the scheme adopted by the government  repeats the previously approved scheme, which--however--turned  out to be rather ineffective. The fully authorized  organizations--Ukrnaftogazzabez and Rosnaftokomplekt--were  unable to sufficiently provide the material and technical  elements to cover the Ukrainian debt for energy sources. In the  case of the Ukrzakordonnaftogaz, the operating principles will  be similar to the scheme under which the well-known  Austrian-Swiss firm Nordex operates in Ukraine. But it is still  too early to judge the effectiveness of the scheme which will be  implemented by the Ukrzakordonnaftogaz.    The decree issued by the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers "On  the Price of Natural Gas To Be Released to Enterprises of the  Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of the Machine-Building  Industry in 1994" may be summarized as follows.    This decree was adopted by the government on 4 April. It  supplemented the list of government measures with regard to  setting up and regulating a system of settling accounts for  energy sources. According to the decree, the accounts for  imported gas will be managed by enterprises under the Ministry  of Industry and the Ministry of the Machine-Building Industry in  Russian Federation rubles or in hard currency at a price  equivalent to 65 U.S. dollars per 1,000 cubic meters of gas.  Furthermore, this sum will also include the cost of transporting  the gas by the transport organizations of Ukraine's  Derzhkomnaftogaz--computed at 4.1 U.S. dollars per 1,000 cubic  meters. These prices shall not apply to the cost of gas for  enterprises producing fertilizer and other items for protecting  plants and ensuring the success if springtime field operations.  A decree previously adopted by the government "On Settling  Accounts for Natural Gas by Enterprises Under the Minsirty of  Industry and the Ministry of the Machine-Building Industry (No.  23, dated 3 January 1994) stipulated that these enterprises must  pay in karbovantsy for transporting gas through the territory of  Ukraine. The revocation of this point attests to the  government's decisive intention to achieve from the  gas-consumers of the above-mentioned ministries compliance with  the conditions set forth by the Cabinet of Ministers--Ukrainian  enterprises must take part not only in paying for imported  energy sources, but also bear the expenditures of entailed in  delivering them directly to the consumers.    It is anticipated that the Derzhkomnaftogaz transport  organizations will be ensured by the government's decisions  against late payments by the consumers for the delivery of gaz  being imported--for the most part--from Russia. The government's  January decree also indicated that the above-named ministries  and Derzhkomnaftogaz must make sure that contracts are drawn up  by the sub-departmental enterprises for purchasing from each of  them an additional 6 billion cubic meters of gasfor the needs of  the national economy. At that time the price of gas was not  indicated, and the industrial enterprises were in no hurry to  come to terms on this matter, as had been stipulated in the  decree.    It was precisely for that reason that the decree issued by  the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers on 4 April mandated not only  the signing of contracts (to be sure, the terms were not  indicated), but also the payment from the account of 52.4 U.S.  dollars per 1,000 cubic meters of gas. As has been previously  provided for, the Derzhkomnaftogaz is to pay this amount to the  enterprises in Ukrainian karbovantsy "at the official exchange  rate set by the National Bank of Ukraine on the day that the  payment is made." The decree does not indicate whether this  obligation pertains to those enterprises which came to terms and  paid the amount owed prior to 4 April, or whether they must make  additional payments. But if, indeed, there are any such  enterprises, they can only be envied.    Obviously it is by this means that the government is  attempting to compel Ukraine's industrial structures to pay a  greater share of the energy costs for consumers in the budgetary  sphere. And certainly the chairman of the Derzhkomnaftogaz,  Mykhaylo Kovalko, back at the end of 1993 noted that state  financing for providing energy sources to the budgetary spheres  was insufficient for paying for even half of the raw material  being imported. Together with this, the Cabinet of Ministers  obligated the Derzhkomnaftogaz to fully provide for the needs of  the national economy's budgetary sphere.    Because of the differences in the currency exchange rates,  the industrial structures will, obviously, have to cover the  shortfall in budgetary financing. However, such decisiveness on  the part of the government does not mean at all that the  enterprises subordinate to the Ministry of Industry and the  Ministry of the Machine-Building Industry will be in any  immediate hurry to pay for imported energy sources. Moreover,  the gas-transport organizations of the Derzhkomnaftogaz will be  in an advantageous situation. If they previously had to extend  credit--whether they wanted to or not--to the enterprises  involved and had no possibility of settling accounts for  imported energy sources, nowadays the situation has changed  fundamentally.    The leading officials of Ukrgaz and Ukrgazprom have already  had occasion to state that if the domestic Ukrainian gas  consumers pay their debts and will regularly make their  prepayments, at least in part, the gas-transport organizations  as early as June would be able to return most of their debt to  Russia. And by October they would be able to settle their  accounts with the RAT [expansion not given] Gazprom and be able  to purchase gas in any amounts required.    Let's point out here that--by using this method--Ukraine  managed to settle its accounts with Russia for gas deliveries  during the first three months of the current year--to the extent  of approximately 110 million U.S. dollars. However, paying back  its debt for 1993--amounting to approximately 700 million U.S.  dollars--still remains a serious problem.</p>

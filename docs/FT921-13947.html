			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / International Company News: Japan Airlines strengthens Qantas links JAPAN Airlines (JAL) is strengthening its relationship with Qantas, the Australian airline, through a series of leasing agreements, but it denied Japanese press reports that it planned to take a 5 per cent equity stake in the company, writes Robert Thomson in Tokyo. JAL is to lease Qantas aircraft and pilots for three routes between Japan and Australia, with the Japanese airline providing the passenger service staff. The agreement is likely to begin in April this year and last for two years, and will help JAL overcome a shortage of pilots. But JAL insisted that it has no firm plans to take a holding in the state-owned Qantas.</p>

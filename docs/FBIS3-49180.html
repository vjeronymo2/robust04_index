Tibor Dane is the chairman,  Odon Bitay the deputy chairman, and Karoly Nagy is the secretary  of the group that is a new platform of the Democratic Union of  Hungarians in Romania [RMDSZ -- UDMR in Romanian], the reports  say. NEPSZABADSAG's Bucharest correspondent asked Odon Bitay  what the actual goals of the organization are.    [Bitay] The Social Democratic New Left-Wing Group was formed  as an internal organization of the RMDSZ at a meeting of  counties in Kolozsvar on 18 December 1993. Its establishment was  justified by the fact that the general goals of the RMDSZ's  program and the groups that have been formed as the RMDSZ's  internal platforms ignore the vital issues of workers and  wage-earners. We could call ourselves some kind of internal  opposition of the RMDSZ as opposed to the sometimes extreme  liberal ideas because we are offering an alternative regarding  the ways to achieve the economic and social goals. It is our  fundamental goal to represent the interest of workers, small  entrepreneurs in towns and villages, the emerging agricultural  paid laborers, young people, disadvantaged people, and primarily  the unemployed and the pensioners, on a political level.    [NEPSZABADSAG] What are the similarities and the differences  between the goals of your group and the RMDSZ?    [Bitay] We see the future in establishing a social market  economy based on mixed ownership, and we are trying to ensure  equal opportunities for wage-earners and manual and intellectual  workers -- as they are the biggest social group -- both in their  life chances and in the area of acquisition of property. We  support the Union of Hungarian Workers in Romania, the RMDSZ  co-organization that since May 1992 has been representing the  economic interests of workers. We will support their political  ideas so that we can assert the workers' interests in the  RMDSZ's leading organizations -- mainly the Council of Federal  Representatives -- and, through the RMDSZ's members present in  the two houses of Parliament, in legislation. We clearly laid  down our goals in our program that we published in June 1993 in  the ROMANIAI MAGYAR SZO. However, as the county newspapers and  the electronic media kept quiet about us, there was very little  reaction to our appearance. The reactions that we did receive  were not always positive.    [NEPSZABADSAG] What do you think was the reason?    [Bitay] The new left-wing in our group's name might be  off-putting for many people. They interpret it as some kind of  effort to restore the past. The lack of political culture is  the basic reason for this, and the fact that people here are not  familiar with the essence of the new left-wing political  tendency although this view and ideological trend has gained  followers and has been recognized in the West.    [NEPSZABADSAG] What kind of relations does your group have  with the RMDSZ?    [Bitay] We adhere to the requirements of the statutes  established at the RMDSZ's congress in Brasov. The RMDSZ's  leadership was aware of the establishment of this group. We  forwarded the statement from our inaugural meeting, our program  document, and our statute to the RMDSZ's leadership. We claim  our place in the RMDSZ's structure as a new platform.    [NEPSZABADSAG] What is the territorial basis of your group?    [Bitay] At the moment, we have local representatives in five  counties, namely Harghita, Kovaszna [Covasna], Maros [Mures],  Szilagy [Salaj], and Kolozs [Cluj] counties. However, we are  only at the very beginning of our organization and we hope that  we will also find followers in the other Transylvanian counties  where Hungarians are living.</p>

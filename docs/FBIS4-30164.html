			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: "Frenzied Winds of Civilian </F> Fascism Are Blowing"]    [Text] Strong winds of large-scale fascist suppression  have been blowing in South Korea these days. This attracts  people's attention.    Taking advantage of the inaugural ceremony of the Second  National Federation of General Student Councils [Hanchongnyon],  the South Korean fascist elements babbled [ununhamyo] this  organization is beneficial to the enemy and frantically tried to  arrest leading members of this organization by wielding the  notorious National Security Law. On 18 June they dispatched the  puppet police to five universities, including Hongik University  of Seoul, and kicked up commotions for searches and arrests.    Also, on 20 June, they committed fascist violence by  arresting approximately 270 university students and peasants who  attended meetings and staged demonstrations at Yoido Plaza and  near the Yongdungpo Station to oppose the National Assembly's  ratification of the Uruguay Round agreement. In reporting on  this, even South Korean broadcasting stations pointed out that  this was the first time since the civilian regime was  inaugurated that many people were detained en masses in a single  day.    The South Korean fascist elements responded to the South  Korean workers' struggle for the right to existence with a  wholesale suppression. As reported, when the South Korean  railroad workers demanded the basic right of existence, which  includes wage hikes and the improvement of their working  conditions, the South Korean fascist elements ran amok while  convening a meeting of ministers in charge of public order and  labor or releasing statements. They threatened to detain all  workers if they go on strike.    People cannot but be appalled by such a bestial fascist  suppression offensive never before seen, not even during the  military dictatorships of the Fifth and Sixth Republics. We  cannot but say this is a grave development of the situation.    An insidious political goal is no doubt hidden behind this  reckless suppression offensive by the South Korean fascist  elements. As everyone knows, Hanchongnyon, with which the South  Korean rulers take issue, is the successor of the National  Council of University Student Representatives and an independent  and patriotic student organization that carries out only  righteous activities for independence, democracy, and  reunification and that enjoys enormous prestige among the South  Korean people. An attempt to consider this progressive student  organization to be hostile and suppress and obliterate it is an  unjustifiable antidemocratic and antinational crime. Also, the  struggle by the South Korean peasants and youth and students to  prevent the National Assembly from ratifying the Uruguay Round  agreement is a very just patriotic struggle that determines if  they can protect the rice market, to which the destiny of the 6  million peasants is linked.    Needless to say, the workers' struggle for the right of  existence should not be suppressed. Nevertheless, the present  South Korean rulers who call themselves civilian suppressed the  struggle by the youth and students, workers, and peasants on a  large scale. Why did they do so? This was because the South  Korean rulers have a very insidious political ambition and  vicious endeavor. In short, their suppression offensive is none  other than a reactionary offensive only seen on the eve of a war.    As everybody knows, the South Korean rulers are recently  running amok while talking about an international cooperation  system or sanctions under the pretext of the suspicion of our  nonexistent nuclear development. They are also frantically  kicking up confrontation and war maneuvers to crush their fellow  countrymen with outside force.    They are almost daily and frantically conducting the Rimpac  exercise, an air, land, and sea joint military exercise, a civil  defense exercise, and many other war exercises against us. They  are also recklessly making bellicose remarks as military  countermeasures and surprise strikes. A man called executive  chairman of the Democratic Liberal Party, while prowling about  [ssadanimyo] frontline areas, made the very inciting remarks  that he would fight on battlefields even as a private second  class if a war breaks out.    The South Korean fascist elements are so bestially  suppressing the righteous popular struggle by the youth and  students, workers, and people. This is no doubt an all-out  reactionary offensive to achieve internal stability in  preparations against war.    However, any suppressive offensive by the South Korean  rulers  will not be able to stifle the South Korean people's struggle  spirits. Rather, the further they will strengthen their  suppression, the more vigorously the workers, peasants, and  youth and students will wage their righteous struggle. The  South Korean rulers must clearly know that their fascist  suppressive offensive will only hasten their destruction and act  with discretion.</p>

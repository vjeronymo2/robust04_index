			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / US seeks closer economic ties with EU The US has proposed a stronger economic and trade partnership with the European Union, aimed at curbing the growth of subsidised export financing and co-ordinating policies more closely towards Japan, China and big emerging markets in the developing world. According to a senior administration official, the proposal is intended to reassure the EU that the US has not sacrificed transatlantic relationships in its enthusiasm for closer trade links with Asia and Latin America, and to seek practical ways of working together on shared commercial objectives. The administration's thinking was outlined by Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, at meetings in Brussels last week with Mr Jacques Santer, president-elect of the European Commission, and Sir Leon Brittan and Mr Martin Bangemann, respectively the commissioners for trade and industry. The US has not decided what form the new partnership should take. But Mr Jeffrey Garten, under-secretary of commerce for international trade, who accompanied Mr Brown, said it would demean the proposal to describe it simply as a free trade area. He said the administration's aim over the next year was to elevate the European dimension of its international policies in several ways. A top US priority was to win EU support for stricter international disciplines on export subsidies, particularly the use of official aid to win big infrastructure contracts in the developing world. Though the administration has sharply stepped up support for exports, Mr Garten said its ultimate goal was to reduce the role of governments in international markets. He was worried by Japan's untied aid, which he said totalled Dollars 15bn to Dollars 20bn (Pounds 9bn-Pounds 12bn) annually, almost half of it for infrastructure projects in China. The US suspects the aid is used to favour Japanese companies and wants more information about how it is spent. Washington also wants international action to curb the use of bribes to win export orders. Mr Garten said another important goal of the proposed dialogue with the EU was closer co-ordination of trade policy in the new World Trade Organisation and other multilateral forums. However, Mr Garten said this did not rule out further US bilateral trade initiatives, particularly towards Japan and China, where very vigorous action was likely. The US also wants to seek ways of reducing obstacles to trade with the EU, particularly in the information industries. Mr Brown has proposed that the two sides should hold preparatory talks before a G7 meeting on telecommunications policy in Brussels early next year.</p>

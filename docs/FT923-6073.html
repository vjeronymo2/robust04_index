			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / The case for a realignment: Adjustment of the ERM currencies is becoming increasingly likely THE PRESSURES for a realignment of the European exchange rate mechanism are growing, as a result of the strong D-Mark and mounting doubts about economic and monetary union. Such a change would probably lead to a two-speed system for linking Europe's currencies, in which the values of the strong currencies in the system were increased while the weaker ones were depressed. Such a move would receive less than rapturous welcome from individual governments, particularly from those countries deemed to have 'second class' currencies under the new system. It would also worry those who believe that sticking to the existing parities governing the ERM's 10 currencies is essential if downward pressure on inflation across Europe is to be maintained. But a growing number of international economists believe a French rejection of Emu in its September 20 referendum on the Maastricht treaty might trigger unstoppable pressures for an ERM realignment, the first since 1987. Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the Swiss Bank, said: 'A No vote would stop Emu in its tracks. It would almost certainly lead to a big bout of selling of the weak ERM currencies such as the pound and the Italian lira, and force a realignment on to the political agenda.' Mr Winfried Hutmann, head of research at Schroder Munchmeyer Hengst, a German investment bank, said a realignment would be welcome because it would 'allow room for a downward movement in some European currencies and speed up European growth'. Behind such statements are the special circumstances of German unification which has increased German inflation, and led to high interest rates. These have pushed the D-Mark to new highs, and also forced other ERM nations to adopt similarly tight monetary policies. Another important factor is the increasing doubts over whether Emu - which is supposed to lead by around the end of the century to a single European currency, presided over by a single European central bank - will go ahead on schedule. The tight targets for Emu agreed at the end of last year related to inflation and government borrowing persuaded many investors that the weak currencies in the system would be 'hardened' by the process of moving towards union. That has helped to increase buying support for weak currencies, which have included the pound and lira, together with the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo But the theories about currency 'hardening' have received a blow from strong indications that France, one of Emu's prime movers, might decide to reject the concept. If the French vote No, then a wave of buying for the currencies regarded as strong - including the D-Mark and probably those of France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark - can be expected. Would the resulting large increase in their value - and the lowering of the values of the weak currencies - spell the end for the ERM? Mr Dieter Wermuth, head of research at the Frankfurt office of Caisse des Depots, the French financial agency, said: 'After the initial panic, the ERM will survive. The ERM is more important than Emu.' According to Mr Michael O'Hanlon, an international economist at the London office of Kidder Peabody, the US investment bank, a continuation of the ERM after a No vote would almost certainly require a realignment to depress the values of the weaker currencies and allow countries like Britain and Italy to cut interest rates and speed growth. Of concern to the UK government is the danger of the financial markets interpreting such a move as a straightforward sterling devaluation. In this case, according to some economists, the markets might require higher, rather than lower, UK interest rates. But Mr George Magnus, international bond economist at SG Warburg Securities, the UK investment house, thinks the risks for Britain of a move of this kind would be worth taking. 'On balance, a realignment would have beneficial effects for the European economy. If the realignment involved the whole of Europe and was dressed up as being made in the context of the unique circumstances of German unification, then I think, in the case of Britain, that the markets would be forgiving.'</p>

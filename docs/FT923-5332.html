			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Swedish capital flows out AS MUCH as SKr22.1bn (Pounds 2.3bn) of capital flowed out of Sweden last week in the crisis of financial confidence that forced the country's Central Bank last Wednesday to raise its interest rate by 3 percentage points to 16 per cent, writes Robert Taylor in Stockholm. The size of the capital outflow, which was published by the Central Bank yesterday after the markets closed, was much larger than expected. It is the biggest outflow since last November after Finland's devaluation of the markka forced the Swedish Central Bank to raise its interest rates by 6 per cent. The total amount in Sweden's capital reserves has fallen to SKr95.2bn. During the past two days the money markets and the bourse in Sweden have remained nervous about the immediate economic outlook. But yesterday's news about the magnitude of the capital outflow could lead to further anxiety when trading resumes this morning. Short-term interest rates have continued to rise since the middle of last week. Yesterday the bourse general share index fell by 2.6 per cent. This followed a 0.9 per cent decline on Monday. Sweden's centre-right coalition government continues to insist no new economic measures are needed to deal with the financial crisis.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz has declared that the  massacre perpetrated in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron today was  designed to ruin the negotiations and create a climate of  obstruction and chaos that will hinder all the peace efforts.  Buwayz said he believes this is neither a new nor a transient  Israeli act.    These remarks by Minister Buwayz were quoted by the  reporters' doyen Milhim Karam, who, along with a delegation from  the Journalists Association, met the foreign minister at noon  today.    [Begin Karam recording] His Excellency Minister Faris Buwayz  believes that this morning's massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque in  the blessed month of Ramadan was designed to ruin the  negotiations and create a climate of obstruction and chaos that  will hinder all the peace efforts. The foreign minister  believes that this Israeli conduct is neither new nor transient,  because the Israeli Government is a weak government that  colludes with and facilitates the acts of every saboteur,  fundamentalist, or extremist movement.    Reports in the past two days of a prospective Cabinet  reshuffle are untrue. Minister Buwayz asserts that any earnest  discussion of a reshuffle, Cabinet change, or of ministers  swapping portfolios is not in the cards now and has not yet been  discussed seriously. [end recording]    Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din, deputy chairman of the  Higher Islamic Shiite Council, speaking during a Friday sermon,  called for halting the negotiations or at least freezing them  for a time to confront the world with its responsibility. If we  do not do this, he remarked, we will be helping to conceal the  crime.    Shams-al-Din added: We are no longer concerned with  protecting the fragile peace, especially if the Hebron massacre  is a harbinger of what will come later.    He called for reinforcing national unity to confront Zionist  aggression, to stop attaching too much importance to minor  sectarian and denominational issues, and to renounce personal,  factional, and partisan ambitions.    The interior minister denounced the incident and demanded  international intervention.</p>

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Morocco (2): Debt is under control but change is still needed - Economic problems and achievements IN THE expanding high rise buildings of Casablanca, Morocco's industrial and banking base, the whiff of dynamism and of an economy at work is strong. And it is in Rabat, the seat of the king, his ministers and of decision- making, that the quiet hum of satisfaction at the country's recent economic successes can be discerned. Morocco, which at one stage looked as if it would go the way of Latin America, appears to have escaped the fate of countries that are saddled by increasing debt and uncontrollable inflation. Instead, it presents an impressive macro-economic record. It still faces an enormous challenge, however, in trying to improve the country's social development record. The origin of Morocco's debt problem is to be found in the severe bout of overspending in the 1970s when, after the rise in the price of oil by the oil-producing countries, the price of phosphates, Morocco's largest mineral export, also increased. It went on a spending spree and invested heavily in the development of the phosphate industry - three-quarters of the world's phosphate reserves are in Morocco - but by the early 1980s the collapse of world prices for phosphates, the cost of importing oil and a drought conspired to make it turn to the IMF for help. Morocco has followed a regime of structural reform since 1984 which has been so well implemented by Mr Mohammed Berrada, the finance minister, that the country has been held up by international institutions as a role model for countries in chronic economic difficulties. The government's budget deficit has been steadily reduced from around 12 per cent of gross domestic product in the early 1980s to under 2 per cent in 1992. The current account deficit in the balance of payments has also been brought down from 10 per cent to less than 2 per cent over the same period. This, combined with steady export-led growth, has allowed Morocco to control its total external debt of just over Dollars 21bn. The ratio of debt outstanding and disbursed to GDP dropped from 113 per cent during 1984-87 to 73 per cent in 1992. The ratio of paid debt service to exports declined from 31 to 28 per cent over the same period. Debt-service repayments with the Paris Club creditors, which account for about half the debt, have been rescheduled several times in the 1980s and what is billed as the last rescheduling took place in February 1992. Some Dollars 2.7bn owing to Saudi Arabia was written off by Riyadh in thanks for Morocco's support of the coalition forces in the war against Iraq. Morocco hopes that another politically correct tactic will also prove profitable. Rabat was the stopover for a press conference by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, and Mr Shimon Peres, his foreign minister, who lauded the warm welcome extended to them by King Hassan. Morocco is hoping that the move will help attract foreign investment to the country. Last year it increased to Dollars 514m from Dollars 330m the year before. The result of macro-economic discipline has been to save Moroccans from the ravages of inflation. The inflation rate averaged 5 per cent last year, compared to 8.2 per cent in 1991. The dirham has also held its value, allowing the government to introduce dirham convertibility for international transactions in January with full convertibility as the goal. Despite the years of austerity and the cuts in government spending, the economy has managed to grow, albeit erratically, due to its dependence on the agricultural sector, which is in turn victim to the vicissitudes of rainfall. Gross domestic product averaged 4.5 per cent over the period 1985-1991 but the economy contracted by 3 per cent last year due to a drought which is now in its second year. The current slump has also been exacerbated by recession in Morocco's main export markets, notably France, which takes some 30 per cent of Moroccan exports. The trade deficit therefore worsened in 1992 to Dollars 2.4bn from Dollars 2.1bn in 1991, although higher tourism receipts as the sector recovered from the slump caused by the Gulf War which, along with greater remittances from Moroccans working abroad, is the country's main source of foreign exchange earnings, narrowed the current account deficit to just over Dollars 500m in 1992 from Dollars 650m in 1991. The government is now trying to accelerate a process of liberalisation and privatisation to attract foreign investment. In an open letter in July, King Hassan asked Mr Muhammad Karim Lamrani, the prime minister, to speed up the implementation of the structural and administrative reforms to create a favourable environment for productive investment but also to take measures which will allow investors, in the short term, to cope with the vagaries of the economic environment. However, the success of the structural adjustment programme can mask the very real economic problems facing the majority of the population. A recent World Bank report highlighted lagging performance in social indicators and labour absorption: despite recent progress in reducing poverty, such indicators as child mortality, nutritional status for the lowest income groups, access to safe water, and literacy and primacy school enrolment rates, especially among women, remain well below averages for countries with similar per capita incomes. There has been some improvement since the mid-1980s but many Moroccans feel that the government reacts only when it has no choice. One such time was in 1990, when violent protests against poverty and unemployment prompted an increase in social spending by the government. The population of 25m is young, with over 75 per cent below the age of 25 years. Unemployment, even for university graduates, is a real problem and the most recent estimates, for 1991, put unemployment at 20 per cent in urban areas, compared to 12 per cent 10 years earlier. Comparisons with neighbouring Tunisia are not flattering. While GNP per capita in Morocco is Dollars 1,030, it is Dollars 1,523 in Tunisia. About one in seven Moroccans lives below the poverty line (an improvement on one in five in 1985) compared with one in 15 in Tunisia. The infant mortality rate is 65 per 1,000 births compared to 43 per 1,000 in Tunisia and life expectancy is 62 years against 70 years for a Tunisian. About 45 per cent of the population in Morocco lives in the countryside and the rural-urban gap is enormous. Primary school enrolment rates are 73 per cent for boys and 54 per cent for girls, but as low as 35 per cent for girls living in the countryside. Only 23 per cent of the rural population is literate compared with 63 per cent in urban areas. The government is now preparing a strategy to improve living conditions for the poor and has come under pressure from the World Bank to do so, since the second tranche of the Structural Adjustment Loan is dependent on the materialisation of the report. Some government members are unhappy about the pressure being exerted upon them. 'Social development has become fashionable,' said one minister. 'But how are we to control the economy and spend money on the social side? We need to invest in social development but you can only do that if you have money and for that you need growth.' The government also faces criticism and resentment from its seemingly prosperous business class. 'I'm appalled at all the stories about how Morocco's economy is perfect when we all know there are so many problems,' says one Moroccan industrialist unhappy at the country's weak industrial structure. 'Why do you think foreign investors do not come to Morocco? It is because the business climate is so bad.' Businesses are suffering from a severe shortage of office space due to property speculation which has left rents beyond the reach of all but the very wealthy. As a result, buildings stand empty while accommodation is acutely needed. While good laws exist, some people complain that the judiciary cannot be relied on to implement them and that it is up to the country's political leaders to set an example. Morocco will need change from the top if it is to capitalise on its impressive record of structural adjustment and rely on the development of its own productive resources to ease poverty and encourage an efficient economy.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FOREIGN INVESTMENT: PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES (DOLLARS M)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  1988      1989      1990      1991      1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- France           37.1      53.5      69.9     111.8     118.6 Spain             4.9      13.7      18.8      28.1      95.0 US                3.8      10.3       5.8      10.6      34.4 Switzerland       5.1      12.5      11.9      37.4      32.3 Saudi Arabia     13.8      37.9      20.8      29.5      26.4 Others           64.3      98.1      99.8     157.6     197.3 Total           129.0     226.0     227.0     375.0     504.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Ministry of Finance Rabat  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- KEY ECONOMIC INDICATORS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  1989    1990    1991    1992    1993*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Real rate of GDP growth (%)       2.5     3.7     5.1    -2.9     3.0 Exports (Dollars bn)              3.3     4.2     4.3     4.0     3.5 Imports (Dollars bn)              5.5     6.9     6.9     7.4     6.5 Trade deficit/GDP (%)            -9.4   -10.4    -9.3   -11.7   -10.9 Current account deficit   (Dollars bn)                   -1.0    -0.7    -0.6    -0.5    -0.5  as a percentage of GDP          -4.4    -2.8    -2.2    -1.9    -1.7 Foreign investment (Dollars m)  226.0   227.0   375.0   504.0   462.0 Outstanding foreign debt   (Dollars bn)                   20.8    20.6    21.1    21.3    21.6 Debt service (Dollars bn)         3.6     3.9     3.3     3.2     2.9  as a percentage of current    income                        53.6    44.7    38.5    34.8    34.3  of which interest charges    (Dollars bn)                   1.4     1.5     1.4     1.3     1.3   as a percentage of GDP          6.0     5.8     5.1     4.7     4.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Forecast.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Ministry of Finance, Rabat.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

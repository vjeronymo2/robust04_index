			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / IMF laces growth projections with caution: World Economic Outlook warns governments of need to cut budget deficits after recovery THE International Monetary Fund's latest growth forecasts for the world economy are laced with caution, as befits an organisation that has knocked 1.3 percentage points off the 1992 global growth forecast it made only last October. But the Fund believes there are several positive factors to justify its projections of slow growth this year and accelerating activity in 1993 that are detailed in the accompanying table. Inflation has been generally low and falling, in contrast to the recessions of 1974-75 and 1980-82. This has allowed a substantial reduction of short-term interest rates in North America, the UK and Japan. Large disturbances from the commodity markets have been notable by their absence. Factors that caused last year's weaker-than-expected activity are either no longer at work or are diminishing. The economic effects of the Gulf war have dissipated while households and businesses have reduced their high levels of debt. Developing countries are improving their economic performance. On the other hand, the IMF acknowledges that the projected recovery in industrial country growth to 1.8 per cent this year from 0.8 per cent in 1991 is lacklustre. Growth has been held back by worsening consumer confidence in most industrial countries; increased taxation and high interest rates in Germany, which have resulted in high interest rates elsewhere in Europe; and reduced spending on business investment in Japan. These negative factors continue to cast doubt over the prospects for recovery. approved of the way governments have allowed their budgets to move into deficit to counter falling economic activity. Similarly, countries such as Canada, the US and Britain, which have suffered recession, or Japan, where activity has slowed, have been right to lower interest rates. But its latest World Economic Outlook warns that governments must not lose sight of their medium-term objectives of sustainable growth and price stability. They must therefore be prepared to cut budget deficits when growth recovers - and then keep tight control over government spending - and be ready to tighten monetary policy in case inflationary pressures revive. The need for governments to cut fiscal deficits is one of the main messages of the Outlook. The IMF takes an especially tough line in the case of Germany which, it says, should speed its fiscal consolidation plans. The large fiscal deficit that emerged in the course of unification initially provided considerable stimulus to activity in Germany and its partners, it says. But growth in Europe is now being constrained by the high interest rates required to deal with the resulting inflationary pressures in Germany. The Fund is less harsh on the US, which has had a large budget deficit for the past decade. It regrets that the US and Italy failed to consolidate their budgetary positions during the period of strong growth in the 1980s and urges the US to use growth in the 1990s to cut its deficit. Any discretionary fiscal action by the US should be limited to revenue-neutral tax and public spending reforms that would increase efficiency. In the case of Japan, which is expected to come under pressure from its Group of Seven partners to bring forward public spending, the IMF says 'there is no evident case for a shift in fiscal policy'. It is in the medium term that fiscal consolidation would yield most benefits, the IMF believes. In the case of the US, a credible package of measures to reduce the deficit would boost confidence and demand. The IMF also urges the industrialised countries to make greater efforts to correct other important medium-term structural problems. 'In all the major countries, substantial steps are required to liberalise agricultural trade and reduce domestic support,' it says. In addition, tax policies, particularly in the US, should be overhauled to improve the allocation of savings and investments. Europe's high unemployment points to a need for labour-market reform. The IMF says Japan requires further financial deregulation and reform of competition policy and land management. Germany, meanwhile, must reduce rigidities in its economy, particularly in the industrial and services sectors, and make 'long overdue' cuts in subsidies.

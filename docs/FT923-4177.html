			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Survey of Mobile Communications (10): Time for some new ideas - Radiopaging THE radiopager is arguably the oldest form of personal communications. But the unexpected success of the mobile telephone has been something of an embarrassment to the sector, relegating it to the status of a poorer cousin. Now it is looking to boost its image and its income with some new ideas and a new approach. Radiopaging first saw the light of day at St Thomas's Hospital, London, in 1956, as a way of contacting doctors and other personnel when they were needed. Even today, radiopaging remains the simplest form of personal communications. Three different types of radiopager are available. The simplest and cheapest is the tone only radiopager. It costs around Pounds 10 a month to rent and use. It beeps to alert its owner that someone wants to get in touch with him or her. The numeric radiopager, which costs around Pounds 20 a month, uses a tiny screen to display numbers. These could be either the phone number of the person who wants to get in contact, or coded messages. Thus, a service engineer might deduce from the number 200--3, that Mr Bloggs from Woolworth needs some more fax paper. The top option is the alphanumeric radiopager. This can cost up to Pounds 30 a month. A small screen displays text and numbers. Typical alphanumeric radiopagers can hold up to 400 characters. Some even hold up to 2,000. The UK's six radiopaging network operators - Aircall Communications, BT Mobile Communications, Intercity Paging, Hutchison Paging, Mercury Paging and Racal Vodapage - serve some 700,000 radiopaging users. But this figure is only some 200,000 up from the number of radiopagers in use in the mid-1980s when the cellular telephone was launched. By contrast, the UK's two cellular radio network operators now support over 1.3m users. As though to rub salt into the wound, radiopaging's own version of the GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) digital pan-European cellular radio system now being introduced across Europe, Euromessage, was initially supported by all six operators, but only one, Hutchison Paging, is now continuing with the service. It allows radiopaging users to take their pagers with them on their travels across Europe. The relative success of cellular and failure of radiopaging has prompted an industry rethink. Some basic principles - particularly in the area of marketing - are being questioned, including: radiopaging users rent but do not buy; radiopaging is a stand-alone service; only people in suits are interested in radiopaging; radiopagers must be black. Mr Trevor Harvey, chairman of the UK Paging Operators Association which represents the interests of the six network operators, points out that most radiopaging network operators rent their equipment. 'But things are changing,' he notes. Hutchison Paging was the first radiopaging network operator in the UK to offer a sale-only option. It brought the idea from Hong Kong, where it commands over half of the 800,000-strong market. 'We now have a market share in excess of 50 per cent in Hong Kong and we've never rented a pager,' notes Mr Mike Bowerman, managing director of Hutchison Paging UK. In the UK both Hutchison and Mercury Paging offer a sale option. Moreover, Mr Owen Lamont, general manager responsible for radiopaging at BT Mobile Communications, says that it will start selling radiopagers by October. According to Mr Mike Walton, marketing manager at Mercury Paging, many users 'would find it more effective to buy their pagers and thus reduce their monthly costs'. Though the majority of radiopagers in use today are rented, some observers believe it might not be that long before the ratio is reversed. Another dogma which is being called into question is that radiopaging should be seen as a stand-alone service. In contrast, 'the real strength of the pager is probably as a complement to other communications technologies,' notes Mr Harvey. One strong potential area of growth where the industry hopes that the whole will add up to more than just the sum of the parts is the combination of radiopaging with voice messaging. This allows callers to leave spoken messages on centralised computer systems, triggering a radiopager so that the intended recipient of the message can retrieve quite complex information. All six radiopaging operators offer combined radiopaging/voice messaging packages. Another synergetic area may be to combine radiopaging with telepoint, the service which allows users of cordless telephones to use them not only at home or in the office but while out and about. In many ways it provides a perfect complement to radiopaging - while radiopagers can only receive messages, today's telepoint handsets can only make calls, so together they provide inbound and outbound communications. The telepoint option, at least for the time being, is open only to Hutchison, as it alone of the radiopaging network operators operates a telepoint network. Also gone is the belief that radiopaging is exclusively the preserve of the consumer. In the US, even schoolchildren are becoming users. BT's Mr Lamont believes that with the right marketing and advertising strategies, the UK radiopaging market could develop similarly, although he admits: 'It will be a challenge.' The move from renting equipment to selling it is likely to be significant in the development of a consumer market for radiopaging. Radiopagers are getting smaller and new colours - other than black - are starting to appear. Pen-sized models are also already available, as are radiopagers integrated into wrist-watches, and even organisers with radiopagers in them. 'The possibilities are endless,' Mr Lamont notes. As well as the rethink in marketing, radiopaging is also beginning to benefit from some new network technologies, something particularly welcome to the relatively new entrants to the field, who are keen to roll out their networks as soon as possible. Mercury and Hutchison, for instance, both now use satellite links to relay radiopaging messages from control centres to the radiopaging transmitters. This cuts operating costs significantly. Despite the initial disappointment of Euromessage, a flicker of hope still remains among many in the industry that crossborder paging can yet be made to work. Hutchison Paging has spent the last two years carefully negotiating the rights to all of the UK's allocation of spectrum for Euromessage. Many believe with control now in the hands of a single network operator, success may still be in store for Euromessage. Enthusiasm for global messaging, however, not so long ago the goal of a number of actual and potential radiopaging operators, seems to have been dampened. The general opinion seems to be that global messaging is still a long way off.</p>

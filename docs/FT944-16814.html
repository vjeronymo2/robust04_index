			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Inflation 'will stay China's big headache' China's economy is headed for a 'soft landing' in 1995, but inflation is likely to remain the country's biggest headache, according to a joint report by the State Statistical Bureau and the Academy of Social Sciences. The authoritative study, based on the first eight months of this year, forecast inflation for 1994 at 19.5 per cent and GDP growth at 11.5 per cent, compared with a planning target of 9 per cent. The study predicted what it described as a 'smooth slowdown' next year, with growth of 10 per cent and inflation of 13 per cent. The report said that most economic indicators had been 'getting nearer' government projections. Economists had expressed fears that Beijing's attempts to curb monetary growth and impose tighter credit ceilings risked severe retrenchment, but GDP trends indicate that the economy is continuing to grow strongly. China registered average GDP growth in the past two years of 13 per cent and this contributed to overheating and inflation, partly fuelled by a capital spending boom. The study said that apart from inflation, China's 'prominent problems' included excessive investment in fixed assets, poor performance of some state-owned enterprises, relatively low growth in the agricultural sector, and a development gap between regions. Consumer prices in China's 35 biggest cities surged by 27.1 per cent in August compared with the same month last year. China's leaders have made fighting inflation their main priority, and have instituted price controls on basic foodstuffs and services. The survey predicted China's trade deficit would narrow this year, with exports of Dollars 115bn (Pounds 76.6bn) and imports of Dollars 120bn, compared with a deficit last year of about Dollars 10.4bn. The manufacturing sector would show strongest growth this year of 16 per cent, with services growing by 10 per cent and agriculture 3 per cent.</p>

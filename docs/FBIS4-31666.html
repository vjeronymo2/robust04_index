			<p>BFN     [Text] Haris Silajdzic, prime minister of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and General Michael Rose, commander of the  UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] for Bosnia-Herzegovina, held  talks in Sarajevo today on the possibilities of reaching a  political solution to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and on the  situation on the lines of separation. After the meeting, Prime  Minister Haris Silajdzic told journalists that we cannot expect  a complete peace in our country as long as the borders with  Serbia and Montenegro are open. Until control is established  over these borders, we will not have peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, our prime minister pointed out among other  things. Mirela Hukovic has the details:    [Begin Hukovic recording] After their meeting today, Gen.  Rose and Haris Silajdzic gave statements for domestic and  foreign journalists. Gen. Rose said the following:    [Rose, in English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian  translation] I talked with the prime minister about the latest  development of events along the lines of separation. I must say  that I am encouraged by the development of events. We only had  one or two cases of truce violations and that number is not  increasing. Recently I visited (?a certain) number of positions  in the sensitive regions. I think that it is very calm and I  hope that (?it will stay) [word indistinct].    [Silajdzic] [words indistinct] also talked about the  solution -- a political solution, of course -- and I told  General Rose again [word indistinct] we cannot expect a complete  peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina as long as the borders with Serbia  and Montenegro are open. Until control is established over  these borders, we will not have peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. If  the regime in Belgrade says -- and it does say so -- that it has  nothing to do with the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, then why does  it not allow these borders to be controlled? (?There is this)  Resolution 838, the Security Council resolution, we have to  implement that resolution, and then we can begin to seriously  talk about peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We posed the question  again of what to do if representatives of the aggressor  (?refuse) any peace solution and whether we shall -- as we did  after the (?London) conference -- say that [words indistinct] or  we shall [words indistinct].    (?In my opinion), the international community has several  things to chose, from ranging from increasing the sanctions to  lifting the embargo [words indistinct] control of borders. I  think that the control of the borders with Serbia and Montenegro  is the key to peace not only in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also in  the entire region. Thank you very much. [end recording]</p>

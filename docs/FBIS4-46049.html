			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [`mes' report: "SPD: Expansion of Arms Exports"] </F>   [Text] Bonn -- Government resolutions that could lead to a  relaxation of the rules governing arms exports will have a  bearing on parliament. On Thursday, the SPD [Social Democratic  Party of Germany] spoke of a "major departure" from current  practice concerning the granting of export permits, and demanded  that the relevant Bundestag committees be informed. The reason  is a decision by the Federal Security Council reached some time  ago, whereby individual permission will no longer be required  for deliveries of weapons parts to the 25 countries of the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development [OECD].    The Economics Ministry confirmed this resolution last week,  and said that the Association of German Industry [BDI] would now  be informed about it. BDI spokesman Volker Franzen welcomed the  decision, saying that German enterprises would no longer be at a  disadvantage vis-a-vis other European firms. On the other hand,  Hermann Bachmaier, the SPD Bundestag faction's expert on arms  exports controls, criticized the whole procedure, saying that  the government's principles governing arms exports, laid down in  1982 and never officially abolished, would thus be circumvented  to a major extent.    According to the government's resolution, supplies of  weapons  parts to partner enterprises in the OECD will be permissible  provided that the German share in the final product does not  exceed 20 percent. This relaxation does not apply to nuclear,  biological, and chemical weapons, nor to carrier systems. In  addition, the partner firms are to reach agreement with each  other on "which countries can and cannot receive supplies." The  to-date practice of individual permits will continue to apply to  exports of weapons to Third World countries.    The Economics Ministry claimed that the new rules lie  "within  the framework of the export-political principles" of 1982,  adopted by the government of Helmut Schmidt. Without  specifically mentioning the OECD, the Ministry said that the  exports of armaments outside NATO remains restricted and, in  particular, "may not lead to the expansion of export-capable  armaments production capacity." Employment considerations should  also play no special significance in exports of war weapons, it  was said.    According to SPD deputy Buchmaier, the new resolutions will  lead to a "massive expansion" of arms exports by German firms to  areas beyond NATO. That would also make German weapons firms  "indirectly" involved in weapons deliveries to the world's  crisis spots. Buchmaier also referred to the Defense Ministry's  "planning games" on the subject of establishing a European  "Agency for Arms Exports." Plans like this would cause a further  departure from the relatively strong German control criteria  governing arms exports.    Apparently, German industry has been eagerly expecting the  new regulations. In a statement replying to the government  resolution, German Aerospnace said that European defense  industries, beset by falling personnel levels, shrinking  markets, and exploding costs, will be forced to adopt new forms  of cooperation. "What is needed now is real Euro-firms that are  capable of transcending all levels of depreciation and political  borders, and can operate on the basis of their own  entrepreneurial responsibility," said German Aerospace.</p>

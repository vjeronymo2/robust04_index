			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: Turnround at Lawson Mardon LAWSON MARDON, the Can-adian-based international packaging group, staged a turnround in 1992. The group registered a net profit of CDollars 17.4m (USDollars 13.8m), or 58 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 10.8m, or 38 cents, including restructuring charges, in 1991. Revenues rose 7.3 per cent to CDollars 1.3bn, despite the North American and European recessions. Last autumn, Lawson raised CDollars 105m in new equity. About two-thirds of its sales are made in Britain, but late last year it bought Spain's largest packaging company from Cragnotti &amp; Partners, the Italian investment group that holds 48 per cent of Lawson. Other acquisitions are planned in Europe and North America. Mr Andrea Mattiussi, president, said the results proved that the restructuring last year was a success and the group could face continuing pressure on margins with confidence. 'The Spanish acquisition was a key part of our plan to consolidate Lawson's position in southern Europe, complementing the northern Europe operations and serving as a base for future growth.' Domtar, the Quebec-based pulp and paper and building materials group, has raised CDollars 150m by the sale of 8 per cent convertible unsecured debentures to a group of investment dealers headed by Burns Fry. The funds will be used to repay maturing debentures and for capital spending. Two Quebec government agencies, the Caisse Depot and Societe Generale de Financement have bought CDollars 66m of the issue. The government indirectly owns 44 per cent of Domtar.</p>

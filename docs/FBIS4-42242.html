			<p>BFN     [Text] Following today's events in Manila concerning the  conference on East Timor, we are now going to speak live to  Foreign Minister Durao Barroso.    [[Unidentified interviewer] Good afternoon minister. What  consequences may the Manila conference -- namely the Indonesian  pressure -- have on the talks between the Portuguese and the  Indonesian Governments?    [Durao Barroso] Good afternoon. First, the consequences of  the Manila conference, up to now, have been to draw the  attention of the entire international community to the question  of East Timor. I am very happy indeed with this development.  The whole of the international press is highlighting  Indonesia's high-handed attitude toward the Philippines. The  big international TV networks too have been drawing attention to  this. So I regard the overall fruits of this conference as  positive and even encouraging. It is altogether the opposite  result to that sought by the Indonesian authorities with their  high-handedness towards the Government of the Philippines.    As for the talks, I believe these events will obviously  weaken the Indonesian position, because Indonesia cannot tell  the UN secretary general that it wants to set up  confidence-building measures and, at the same time, adopt  attitudes that really reveal its true nature, that of a country  that not only does not respect democratic values within its own  territory but also does not want other countries in the region  to be free to apply their own democratic principles.    [Interviewer] What do you think will be the practical  consequences of all this on the next round of talks? Will  Portugal step back?    [Durao Barroso] No, I cannot tell you that because I cannot  foretell the future. The next round of talks will be as far  away as January of next year. What I believe is that these  events will considerably weaken the Indonesian position and this  will be an encouragement for all those -- the Portuguese  Government included -- who continue to believe that there is a  possibility of reaching a solution, in accordance with the  international law, for the East Timor question.    [Interviewer] It is exactly three years today since the  Bicesse [Angolan peace] agreement was signed. Do you think it  was a worthwhile exercise?    [Durao Barroso] It believe it is always worthwhile when you  are trying to work toward peace. The truth of the matter is  that, thanks to Bicesse, the Angolans managed to experience  peace -- even if only for a short while -- as well as a  democratic process and elections the results of which  unfortunately were not respected. A war was then resumed that  the Angolan people have so far not managed to get rid of. The  truth of the matter is that the effort made by Portugal, by the  observers and the international community, was a legitimate one,  it was worthwhile and is within the context of those talks that  the sides are now looking to the principles subscribed to in  Bicesse to provide a model for national reconciliation so that  peace may again become a reality in Angola.    [Interviewer] You were in Morocco today when the prime  minister asked King Hassan II for help. What sort of help can  the Moroccan king lend to this process between the National  Union for the Total Independence of Angola and the Angolan  Government?    [Durao Barroso] What the prime minister stated -- as you  said, it is true that I was next to the prime minister -- was  that any influence by King Hassan II can indeed be useful to  lead the sides to reach a compromise. The link between Morocco  and the Angolan process is widely known and within the framework  established by the United Nations -- the UN mediation with the  support of observers -- any push, any support from personalities  with international recognition, such as King Hassan II, will  indeed be positive for the process.    [Interviewer] Now for a final question. France and Germany  are getting ready to take to the European Council a joint  French-German joint presidency proposal to start on 1 July. Are  you not afraid of a one-year presidency by these two European  powers?    [Durao Barroso] We are not afraid at all. On the contrary, I  believe that one of the great victories of the European Union  over these years was that it has managed to end with the wars  between Germany and France. Let me remind you that we are just  at this time commemorating the anniversary of D day, which  contributed toward putting an end to World War II. Nowadays we  tend to forget that, my generation did not live through it. The  truth of the matter is that, up to a few years ago, Europe was  always being devastated by wars among European countries and  therefore it is a great European victory for France and Germany  -- for all European countries -- to make it practically unviable  and impossible nowadays for anyone to even imagine a new war in  western Europe. Therefore I am happy with any kind of  collaboration among European states.    It is obvious that this does not mean that we will ever  accept any kind of European directorate. Neither we nor other  countries will accept the idea that there are two, three, or  four European countries that by virtue of their size will impose  their will upon others. I know that is not the wish of either  France or Germany -- both of whom have from the outset done much  for the construction of the European Community and European  Union. We are both available to collaborate both with the  Germans and the French because I am sure they will be a very  strong stimulus for the progress of the European Union.    [Interviewer] Thank you very much, minister. That was  Foreign Affairs Minister Durao Barroso, speaking to us live.</p>

Here follows the text of Yeltsin's letter to Rybkin, as well  as the list of the aforementioned draft laws:    Moscow, Kremlin, 6 March 1994. To State Duma Chairman Ivan  Rybkin:    I am sending you a list of draft laws that I intend to  submit  for approval to the State Duma of the Federal Assembly in 1994,  in accordance with Article 104 of the Russian Constitution.    In the first half of the year, I will introduce draft laws  regulating the procedure for setting up and organizing the  activity of bodies of state power of the Russian Federation, and  primarily aimed at creating a normal, civilized judicial system  in Russia (on the judicial system in the Russian Federation, on  the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court of the Russian  Federation, on the procuracy in the Russian Federation, on the  Government of the Russian Federation, on federal bodies of the  executive power, on the federal state apparatus and others). In  addition to this, in the first half of 1994, I will also prepare  draft laws on general principles of state administration in  Russia's constituent parts, as well as on general principles of  local government. At the same time, I am planning to submit to  the State Duma draft laws on the Civil, Criminal, and Land  Codes, as well as some economic laws.    During the second half of 1994, I am planning to submit  draft  laws aimed at ensuring citizens' economic and political rights  (on forced migrants and refugees from areas of interethnic  conflicts, on ethnic minorities, on protection of rights of the  unemployed, on public events, on political parties, on the  elections of the president of the Russian Federation and of the  State Duma deputies, on the procedure for setting up the  Federation Council of the Federal Assembly, on public  associations and others).    The attached list is not a final one, and some draft laws  presently being worked on may be added to it.    [Signed] Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation  [passage omitted]</p>

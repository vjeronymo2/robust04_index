			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Malaysia set for fifth year of rapid growth MALAYSIA'S economy is set to expand 8.7 per cent in 1992 for a fifth year of rapid growth but the government will check inflation and infrastructure bottlenecks, the central bank said, Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur. Real domestic gross product (GDP) would grow 8.7 per cent from 8.8 per cent this year, making Malaysia one of the fastest-growing economies in the Asia-Pacific, the bank said in its 1991 report. Some analysts said that despite Bank Negara's latest projections, actual growth in 1992 could be slower. Malaysia's inflation hit 4.4 per cent in 1991 from 3.1 per cent in 1990 and Bank Negara said it could rise to 4.5 per cent in 1992. 'We are used to zero or 1 per cent in the past,' Mr Jaffar Hussein, the Bank Negara governor said.</p>

			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WITNESS IN FRUSTACI CASE LEAVES COUNTRY  </P> <P> An attorney for Patti Frustaci, the Riverside woman who gave birth to  septuplets after taking fertility drugs, accused the doctor whom Frustaci is  suing for malpractice of sending an important witness out of the country so  that he could not testify.  </P> <P> The witness, Dr. Ezio Zanutta, who practiced at the Westwood clinic co-owned by  defendant Jaroslav Marik, also treated Frustaci.  </P> <P> Frustaci's attorney, Browne Greene, said Monday in Santa Monica Superior Court  that Zanutta's testimony is central to the case. Frustaci and her husband, Sam,  blame Marik for the death of four of the premature babies and for the health  problems of the three surviving children, who are now 5 years old.  </P> <P> Marik's attorney, Craig Dummit, said his client had no control over Zanutta,  denying any misdeeds. Zanutta left for Europe late last month, just before he  was scheduled to have his deposition taken in the malpractice case. A trial is  set for July 9.  </P></p>

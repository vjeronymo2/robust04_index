			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CRIME INCREASE SPARKS TAX PROPOSAL TO ADD 20 OFFICERS;  </P> <P> ASSESSMENT: SANTA ANA VOTERS WOULD BE ASKED TO SUPPORT A PROPERTY TAX HIKE  AVERAGING $50 ANNUALLY. '. . . THE BAD GUYS ARE WINNING,' A PROPONENT SAYS.  </P> <P> Citing an increase in gang violence and homicides, Santa Ana City Councilman  Richards L. Norton said Wednesday that he wants to ask voters in November to  support a special property tax that would add 20 police officers to the city's  351-member department.  </P> <P> "We're losing the battle on the streets," Norton said, "and the bad guys are  winning."  </P> <P> Norton said he will ask the City Council on Monday to seek an "advisory" signal  from voters on a police benefit assessment district proposal that would  increase property taxes by an average of $50.  </P> <P> The $1.5 million that would annually be raised would go into a special fund to  hire the additional officers, Norton said.  </P> <P> In November, 1988, voters in Inglewood overwhelmingly gave its City Council  approval to become the first city in the state to establish an assessment  district for more police protection. Supporters of the assessment fees say that  Inglewood voters were persuaded to vote for such an increase after drug-related  arrests ballooned in that city. After the fees were established, Inglewood was  able to raise $1.5 million a year and hire 20 more officers for its 187-member  force, said Inglewood Assistant City Manager Norman Y. Cravens.  </P> <P> According to state law, voters can raise taxes for police protection with a  two-thirds vote. But city councils also have the ability to establish special  assessment districts that require residents to pay extra fees for more police  officers, Norton said.  </P> <P> "The ballot will basically ask residents whether they are fed up with the crime  situation and want to get the problem solved," Norton said.  </P> <P> Norton acknowledged that many voters could oppose the plan simply because it  relies on a tax increase.  </P> <P> "I realize it might be an unpopular stance especially in election year," said  Norton, who is up for reelection this November. "But there is not enough fat on  our budget to pay (for more officers.) If we don't do something soon we're  going to have bigger problems."  </P> <P> On Monday night, the City Council will also vote on a $218-million budget that  allocates $43.8 million to the police.  </P> <P> Police Capt. Peter Jensen said his department has not received any details on  the district assessment plan and was unable to comment on it.  </P> <P> Mayor Daniel H. Young said he also has not seen a copy of the proposal.  </P> <P> Don Blankenship, president of the Santa Ana Police Officers Assn., said he  endorses the proposal as long as the money is directly targeted for the police  force.  </P> <P> "We're in total support if the money is going to be used to hire police  officers," Blankenship said. "We don't want the public to be flimflammed by  politicians and the money goes elsewhere."  </P> <P> In February, the City Council turned down an assessment district proposal to  pay for a four-day-a-week, 10-hour-a-day work schedule for its police officers  despite arguments from supporters who said that such schedules attract officers  to Santa Ana.  </P> <P> In a state report released last fall, statistics showed that violent crime in  Santa Ana had risen 28.4% over the year before, a bigger increase than any  other of the county's six largest cities. In 1989, Santa Ana had 53 homicides,  up from 38.  </P> <P> Since April, Santa Ana police have maintained a special weekend patrol in  neighborhoods occupied by the city's estimated 7,000 gang members. Police Chief  Paul M. Walters established the team to counter a burst of gang violence in  April that left two people dead and several others seriously wounded.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SANTA ANA CRIME STATISTICS  </P> <P> Murders and assaults rose dramatically last year, while robberies reached a  six-year high.  </P> <TABLE CWL="4.20IN:1.67IN:1.78IN:1.67IN:1.67IN:1.67IN:1.67IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="7"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Category  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1984  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1985  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1986  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1987  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Homicide  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 39  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 33  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 32  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 31  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 38  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 53  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Rape  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 74  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 59  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 77  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C">  87  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 89  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 74  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Assault with a deadly weapon  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 790  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 601  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 609  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 658  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 853  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,066  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Robbery  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 835  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 865  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,005  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 799  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,041  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,125  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Burglary  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6,131  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C">  5,097  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4,767  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4,300  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3,589  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3,648  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Auto theft  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,815  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2,314  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2,982  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3,045  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3,834  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3,825  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Source: Santa Ana police  </P></p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: ICI The 7 per cent rise in ICI's first quarter profits looks in healthy contrast to most of its Continental rivals. March and early April have seen the beginnings of a consumer-led recovery in the US, the UK and parts of Continental Europe, in paints, textiles and the housing market. The caveat is that a similar improvement was seen a year ago, only to die away a couple of months later. The other proviso is that the 39 per cent rise in profits from pharmaceuticals was mostly due to a slump in last year's first quarter. Pharmaceutical profits still make up nearly half of the total. Industrial chemicals contribute a quarter as much on double the turnover. On this basis, it is slightly early for investors to plunge into ICI as a cyclical recovery stock. The same message could apply to the UK equity market as a whole.</p>

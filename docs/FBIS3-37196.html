			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Viktar Stryzhak: "Belarusian National Party </F> Supports a Third Way"]    [Text] As we have learned, the organizational committee of  yet another political organization -- the Belarusian National  Party [BNP] -- has been established in Minsk.    In a telephone conversation with Mikola Kurak, secretary of  the organizational committee and a reserve officer, Kurak noted  that his party should not be confused with the existing  Belarusian National Democratic Party. According to Kurak, the  main goal of BNP is to unify Belarusians around national ideas,  establish and strengthen the Belarusian state, integrate into  Europe, conduct privatization while preserving promising state  enterprises and kolkhozes, develop national Belarusian business,  and open the path for foreign capital investments.    The BNP organizational committee has issued an appeal to  citizens of Belarus. The main slogan of the appeal is  "Belarusians, help yourselves!" In the opinion of the new  party's founders, Belarusians should consider themselves the  masters of their land. "We must not allow foreigners to oppress  us. They are only guests in our common home of Belarus," the  appeal stresses. "The BNP believes that neither the communist  way nor the current pseudodemocratic one will lead the country  out of political disorder and the economic abyss. The BNP  supports a third way -- the unification of all genuine  Belarusians on a national basis."    The new party is to advocate the supremacy of Belarusians in  all spheres of the country's life. The founders of BNP believe  that the democratic development of our state is a matter of the  future.    As Mikola Kurak said, the constituent assembly of the BNP  will be held in late February or early March. According to  Kurak, a number of signatures exceeding the minimum required to  register a party with the Ministry of Justice has been collected  in the capital alone. Kurak stated that the organizational  committee has supporters in Brest, Homel, and Mahilew Oblasts,  who have agreed to establish the BNP.</p>

			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILINGUAL EDUCATION  </P> <P> As a bilingual teacher, I applaud you for highlighting the importance of  bilingual education.  </P> <P> As a third-grade teacher, working with the class of the year 2000, it seems  appropriate to me that as we approach the 21st Century we see language not as a  political issue, but as an opportunity to increase our understanding of the  world around us.  </P> <P> I advocate bilingual education, beginning in kindergarten, for all students.  </P> <P> MIKE SHALER, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] An agreement on civil peace should be acceptable to  both sides, and should not contain three or four unacceptable  conditions, the leader of the Russian Communist Party, Duma  deputy, Gennadiy Zyuganov, told reporters on Friday.    He said that he had not read the text of the agreement  submitted earlier to the State Duma. Yet he was against  proposals not to introduce changes in the Constitution and not  to hold elections.    Speaking about the movement known as Accord for Russia,  Zyuganov said that the movement's leaders meet every week  coordinating a common platform and main demands for protecting  the country from a civil war and for warding off territorial and  social-economic disintegration. Along with the member of the  Constitutional Court Valeriy Zorkin, the former vice president  Aleksandr Rutskoy and chairman of the Agrarian Party Mikhail  Lapshin, he signed the movement's founding declaration.    He said that in late-April to early-May a Accord for Russia  movement congress is planned which will determine its character  and "attitude to all power structures." Zyuganov said that  regular contacts are being maintained with Aleksandr Rutskoy.  Contacts are established with leaders of the  military-industrial complex, directors of large enterprises and  leaders of other political movements.    Speaking about the current situation in Russia, Zyuganov  said  that "the Kremlin poses the main danger," currently and that  "the only thing left for a hungry man to do is to steal or  rebel."    Answering the question about the changes in the program of  the Russian Communist Party, Zyuganov talked about the rejection  of revolutionary leaps and forceful methods for solving acute  problems, as well as the recognition of the fact that state  ownership as the main system is inadmissible, and that the  multi-structured economy is a reality.</p>

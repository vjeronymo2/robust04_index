This was his first exclusive interview  for SLOBODNA DALMACIJA following the negotiations between  Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic in Bonn.    [SLOBODNA DALMACIJA] In spite of the latest negotiations  between Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic, we heard on Tuesday  morning [11 January] that the Muslim army was continuing the  attacks on the HVO troops in central Bosnia.    [Roso] Yes, this information is correct. The Muslim army  continued the attacks on Croat territories at Vitez, Novi  Travnik, and Busovaca. It is certain, which the information  from the ground has confirmed, that the Muslims will not be give  up their ambitions. Apart from attacking almost all our defense  lines, they are also preparing new attacks. We know that their  plans to attack Kiseljak have been completed.    [SLOBODNA DALMACIJA] How do the HVO troops respond to this,  and what is the current situation in central Bosnia?    [Roso] We respond the way we have to in order to survive.  We can only survive by fighting and defending ourselves. I  would say that we Croats have a genetic will to survive, but  also the will for peace, and certainty about success, because we  know that what we are defending belongs to us. I can say that I  am impressed by the willingness and morale of my troops, which  have warded off all aggressor attacks.  <H5>  Saving the Hostages </H5>   [SLOBODNA DALMACIJA] Is the information that the Muslims  have managed to cut off the communication between Vitez and  Busovaca, true?    [Roso] This information is incorrect. What is correct is  that they had occupied several houses, but our troops, in a  counterattack, retrieved the lost positions at Buhine Kuce. I  must point out that the members of the English battalion, whom  we had had several complaints about, this time helped us get out  the civilians, which we are very grateful about. During the  last Muslim attacks at the area of Buhine Kuce, the Muslim army,  reinforced by some 200 foreigners from Islamic countries, took  away 35 hostages, most of whom are women. We are doing  everything to save these hostages and find out what happened to  the 72 missing Croats from Krizancevo Selo.    [SLOBODNA DALMACIJA] You have said that, during the attack  at Buhine Kuce, the MOS [Muslim Defense Forces] had been  reinforced by foreigners from Islamic countries. We would like  to know how they get to the Muslim areas in Bosnia.    [Roso] They are transferred in various ways by humanitarian  convoys.    [SLOBODNA DALMACIJA] Ground reports speak of the Muslims  having violated international rules of war. What does this  concern?    [Roso] They do violate all the rules of war. In the attacks  at Krizancevo Selo, Lazine, and now at Buhine Kuce, but also  elsewhere, they were using active chemical substances and poison  gases. To protect themselves, our defenders as well as the  civilian population have to use masks and wet cloths during the  Muslim attacks. These are superhuman efforts, and I am sure  that the resistance of the Croats of central Bosnia is  representative of the Croat national struggle. It is an example  of Croat sacrifice and togetherness. I believe in them, and  would like to use this opportunity to tell them to hold on and  that there are no changes of what I promised them in Kiseljak.  My goal is to preserve the Croatian people, and I will use  every available means to prevent the enemy, whatever they may be  called, from pushing us out of our historically Croatian  territories. Regardless of the many enemies, Croats have no  choice; they have to defend their territories in Bosnia.  <H5>  A Message to the Croats </H5>   [SLOBODNA DALMACIJA] Is that a message to the Croatian  defenders and Croatian people in central Bosnia?    [Roso] Not only to them, but to all Croatian people. I would  like to use this opportunity to invite all Croats to help in the  defense of Croatian territories in Bosnia, because without these  territories there is no Croatia. I would like to appeal to  Croats abroad, from the United States and Canada to Australia,  to help the Croatian people's just fight in Herceg-Bosna through  promotional activities. I would like to tell them not to conduct  politics in bars. There is no such thing as a political  prescription, but there is such thing as concept [as published],  which is appearing with united forces. My motto is `Viribus  unitis'. The Americans, Germans, and other nations have  realized that. Everyone has, except some of our fanatics, and  it would be good if they were imitated, if only once. I feel bad  about not having political cohesion and political culture when  it comes to the Croatian people.    [SLOBODNA DALMACIJA] After the negotiations between  Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic, what will be the reactions  of the Croats in Herceg-Bosna?    [Roso] The Croats will again respect all international  decisions, although every time we have presented the  geostrategic reality in the Balkans, the international community  has not taken it seriously. I find it very strange and hard to  understand the actions of our old Europe, which has failed to  understand that this is a realistic political time in which the  Croatian people are demanding their share of the European  equation. I would also like to say that in this war of the  Muslim army against the Croatian people there has also been  extremist Islamic fascism, which is a threat to Europe itself.  I would not like to be misunderstood. The Muslims as a people  are not a problem; it is only some of them who are inclined  toward this extremist Islamic fascism, which now appears in a  new context. The Muslim leaders must realize that in these  areas there can be no other reality except a contemporary  European one.  <H5>  [Box, p 7] </H5> <H5>  Heroic Fighting </H5>   "In Croatia, especially in the Croatian media, there is  little emphasis on the problems of Croats in the besieged  enclaves, who have not received any aid in months. There is  also little talk of the crimes committed against the Croats of  Herceg-Bosna. It hurts me that there is so little mention of  the heroic Croatian fighting in the besieged enclaves around  Turija, Zepce, Vares, and Usora. These people and the brigades  that will not give up a meter of their territory to the enemy  should be congratulated."  <H5>  The Franciscans </H5>   "I would like to ask the Franciscans of Bosna Srebrena to  once again show determination in saving the Croatian people in  Bosnia. They have done so many times in history, and at this  moment the Croatian people in Herceg-Bosna expect them to do it  again. We especially need them to help us with food, because  our people in central Bosnia are hungry."  <H5>  The Arrows </H5>   "I hold the arrows of Croatian youth in my hand. Naturally,  I do not use them. My goal is to preserve each Croatian life,  as well as the Croatian people. I will do everything to stop  the exodus of Croats."</p>

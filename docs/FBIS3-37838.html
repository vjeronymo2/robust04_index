The problem should be handled by  people responsible for this specific sphere, who will look into  particulars, collect comprehensive information and make  appropriate decisions.    The Russian minister was referring to the case of the former  CIA counter-intelligence department leader Aldrich H. Ames and  his wife whom the U.S. Administration accused of spying for the  former Soviet Union and Russia.    According to the Russian minister, Russian-American  relations  have reached a very high level of partnership and cooperation  for "cases like this one" to overshadow them.    Responding to a question from ITAR-TASS, Andrey Kozyrev  admitted that "espionage stories" do crop up, regrettably, in  relations between different countries from time to time, even if  they are NATO allies, or between the United States and Israel.    Andrey Kozyrev expressed the hope that the "Ames problem" is  in no way linked to the Russian president's latest initiative  concerning Bosnia. It would be better, he said, not to  politicize or ideologize the situation but let relevant services  of the two countries handle it.    What is most important is for us "to continue cooperation  and  not to attach undue, hypertrophied significance to this case",  Kozyrev said.</p>

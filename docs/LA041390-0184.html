			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH INCLINED TO FORGIVE GERMANS FOR HOLOCAUST  </P> <P> President Bush said today that he was inclined to forgive the East Germans for  their role in the murder of millions of Jews during the Holocaust.  </P> <P> The East German legislature accepted responsibility Thursday for the Nazi  atrocities during World War II and sought assurances of forgiveness from  Israel, the Soviet Union and Jews around the world.  </P> <P> Bush said he believed that the time has come to absolve Germany for the mass  slaying.  </P> <P> Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One en route to a meeting in Bermuda  with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Bush was asked if the world  should forgive Germany for the Holocaust, in which more than 6 million Jews  were killed.  </P> <P> "I'm one who believes in forgiveness," Bush said. "And this is a good day for  forgiveness -- for those of us who have faith, most of the teachings have ample  room for forgiveness."  </P> <P> Speaking on Good Friday, and noting the approach of Easter Sunday, Bush said  the holiday was one that would be appropriate for forgiving the German state  for the Nazi regime that sent Jews and other political dissidents to their  deaths in gas chambers.  </P> <P> "It's a time to take stock, and it's a time to be glad. So I'm inclined to  think we ought to forgive -- not forget, necessarily, because I think you learn  from history, learn what not to do wrong, how to conduct oneself."  </P> <P> Bush started the Easter weekend by attending a sunrise Good Friday church  service before leaving Washington.  </P> <P> Asked about the service, Bush joked with reporters: "We prayed for you."  </P> <P> He turned more solemn when asked about East Germany and the Holocaust.  </P> <P> "For our family, Easter is a very special time of year," Bush said. "I'm a  Christian and I think that forgiveness is something that I feel very strongly  about."  </P> <P> Bush said his feelings about forgiveness were a "personal observation. It's not  a statement for our country."  </P> <P> In its statement, the East German Parliament said, "Nationalism and racial  madness led to genocide, particularly of the Jews in all European countries, of  the people of the Soviet Union, the Polish people and the Gypsy people.  Parliament . . . admits joint responsibility on behalf of the people for the  humiliation, expulsion and murder of Jewish women, men and children."  </P></p>

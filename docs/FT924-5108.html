			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Straw attacks government pledges over council jobs ABOUT 45,000 local authority employees lost their jobs last year, Labour said yesterday. The party rejected repeated government denials that any redundancies have arisen from the council funding squeeze. Mr Jack Straw, the shadow environment secretary, said the figures proved government pledges that the council tax would not affect employment were not to be trusted. Mr John Major said this week that past Labour warnings of job losses 'have never yet become fact' while Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, said there was 'no need' for the new tax to provoke job losses. Statistics compiled by Local Authority Joint Staffing Watch and examined by independent Commons' researchers show that about 34,000 full-time and 11,000 part-time jobs were lost in England in the year to June. Of those, 6,700 were full-time teachers and 7,500 part-time teaching staff. Mr Straw said a Labour survey of town halls had revealed that not a single council leader contacted would rule job cuts and losses of services as a direct result of the introduction of the new tax. And the 'conditional' language of Mr Howard in his statement on local government spending had tacitly indicated there might be redundancies. Releasing an action plan for Labour councillors, he stressed that authorities must make clear to electors that cuts are a direct result of central government parsimony. A careful look at the plan shows Labour has been put on the defensive. It is aware many voters will blame the cuts in jobs and services on local politicians.</p>

			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THOMPSON'S WALKOUT DOES NOT GENERATE A GREAT DEAL OF SUPPORT  </P> <P> John Thompson should do us a favor. The next time he walks off the court in  protest of an NCAA rule, he should keep walking and never come back.  </P> <P> Thompson feels as though students from lower socioeconomic areas are being  discriminated against. I agree! Those individuals have been cheated out of a  quality education. But how about that student-athlete who excels academically  but loses the basketball scholarship to someone who does not even belong in  college.  </P> <P> Now that's what I call discrimination.  </P> <P> BRUCE KRALL  </P> <P> West Covina  </P></p>

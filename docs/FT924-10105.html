			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Singapore group to buy Rank hotel for Pounds 67.5m THE Rank Organisation is to sell London's Gloucester Hotel to a Singapore property group for Pounds 67.5m in cash. City Developments (UK), a subsidiary of the Singapore-based Hong Leong group, said the 'rare opportunity' to buy the Gloucester was due to the 'prevailing weakness of sterling combined with declining UK interest rates'. City Developments (CDL), listed in Singapore and Hong Kong, said the purchase would be funded by internal resources and bank loans. The sale is due to be completed before February next year. Rank, whose interests include cinemas, film distribution and bingo, said last April it was putting 22 hotels on the market, including five in London. It is retaining more than 30 hotels linked to its Butlin's holiday camp business and its Shearings coach holiday operation. The sale of the 548-room Gloucester brings the number of hotels sold to four. Rank built the Gloucester, which opened in 1973. The group announced the sale of the Athenaeum in London and two Scottish hotels earlier this year. The remaining London hotels up for sale are the Royal Garden, the Royal Lancaster and the White House. Mr Angus Crichton-Miller, managing director of Rank's hotels and holidays division, said he could not say how long it would take to sell the remaining hotels. Rank had always thought each London hotel would attract a different buyer. He expected other foreign buyers to be attracted by the prospect of borrowing sterling cheaply in the UK or taking advantage of the weaker pound to buy hotels using their own cash resources. Mr Crichton-Miller said even with low UK interest rates, Rank would earn more by banking the money from the sale of the Gloucester than from running the hotel. He said room occupancies in Rank's London hotels were above 80 per cent. Although the provincial hotels had a difficult summer, business had picked up in the past eight weeks. Room rates were, however, under pressure. Rank has been allowing US and Australian visitors to convert the sterling room price at a rate of one pound for one US or Australian dollar.</p>

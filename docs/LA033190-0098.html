			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> BOUNDARIES REDUCED FOR HARBOR DISTRICT  </P> <P> The Local Agency Formation Commission voted Friday to shrink the boundaries of  the Oxnard Harbor District to include only the cities of Oxnard and Port  Hueneme and their unincorporated areas.  </P> <P> The LAFCO commissioners also decided that the five district board members will  now be elected by district, instead of at large.  </P> <P> The commission, which decides matters of expansion and contraction for special  districts and cities, voted 5 to 0 to remove parts of Thousand Oaks and  Camarillo as well as unincorporated areas of the county from the district.  </P> <P> The commission made the decision over the objections of Harbor District  officials, who sought an expansion to include the entire county instead.  </P> <P> Shrinking district boundaries will hurt the district's chances to expand the  Port of Hueneme and secure the preferred U.S. Port of Entry status, district  officials said.  </P> <P> But Robert Braitman, executive director of the commission, said that status is  based on volume and business at the port, and not the size of district  boundaries.  </P> <P> In addition, shrinking the boundaries will give those voters who are most  affected by activities at the Port of Hueneme more control over district  management, Braitman said. If voters countywide were to elect district board  members, the voters in Oxnard and Port Hueneme would have far less control over  the district, he said.  </P> <P> District officials have said they will consider suing to prevent the district  boundary changes.  </P> <P> A protest hearing, which is automatically scheduled as part of the boundary  change procedure, will be called within the next three months, Braitman said.  At that time, if more than 25% of the voters now in the district, or more than  25% of the property owners in the new district, oppose the changes, an election  must be held to decide the issue.

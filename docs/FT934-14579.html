			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Mexican groups plan US listings FOUR more Mexican comp-anies are planning to issue equity on the New York Stock Exchange this year, as the corporate sector continues to tap international markets. The four are Grupo Financiero Serfin, the third largest financial group; Grupo Televisa, the big media company; Gemex, the Pepsi-Cola bottler; and Bufete Industrial, a leading industrial construction group. The four issues will bring the number of Mexican companies listed on the NYSE to 12. In the first eight months of 1993, Mexican companies issued Dollars 1.07bn in new equity. Grupo Televisa will offer about 5 per cent of its capital in a Dollars 375m equity offering on the NYSE. The issue will be lead managed by Goldman Sachs. Televisa's ADRs are traded in New York on the private 144a market. Grupo Financiero Serfin, the financial group that owns Banca Serfin, is expected to sell between Dollars 150m and Dollars 200m of equity in the US. It will be the first Mexican financial group to be listed on the NYSE. The offer will be managed by First Boston. Banca Serfin made profits of Dollars 155m in the first half, and has assets of Dollars 21bn. It has total assets of about 77bn new pesos. The bank was privatised with a wave of other banks in 1992. At the time, industrialist Mr Adrian Sada Gonzalez paid about Dollars 940m for a 51 per cent stake. Serfin will offer shares to local investors through the Mexican stock exchange. Serfin's brokerage Operadora de Bolsa Serfin, will lead that tranche, the sources said. Bufete Industrial, a leading industrial engineering company which has a joint venture with Kellogg, the US company, plans to launch an initial public offering on the NYSE and Mexican stock exchange for about Dollars 110m. The offering will be lead managed by Goldman Sachs. Gemex, the Pepsi-Cola franchise holder for Mexico City, Acapulco and the Yucatan, will place 20 per cent of its capital in the NYSE in December for between Dollars 300m and Dollars 400m, according to Enrique Molina, the chief executive. This offering is expected to be managed by Goldman Sachs.</p>

A striking figure on the Hungarian literary scene, President  Arpad Goncz is certainly the most popular political figure in  his country. A renowned former opponent of the communist  regime, he is highly respected and represents a kind of moral  authority in the country. For two years now he has devoted  himself to defending one of the key pillars of democracy:  freedom of the press. In this interview he presents his views  on this subject as well as on the rapprochement between his  country and the EU to L'ECHO. At this juncture, it should be  noted that on Tuesday the Hungarian parliament gave the green  light to the government to submit an official application for EU  membership. That will be done this 1 April, Hungarian Prime  Minister Peter Boross announced.    [Delstanche] Your country would like to join the EU and  NATO.  Do you, like Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, think that 1999  will be too late to join the EU?    [Goncz] Yes, I share this view entirely. We would like to  join as soon as possible so as to anchor our position among the  Western economic system. However, accession also means  integration in a security system. Our security does not  necessarily have to be guaranteed by NATO. However, the role of  the WEU has not yet been clarified, no more than that of the  Atlantic Alliance.    Nevertheless, we believe that our security should not  necessarily be regarded exclusively from the military point of  view, but rather considered from a social, material, economic  viewpoint, which also implies economic development.    Meanwhile, the Partnership for Peace has constituted a very  important step forward toward greater security, first because it  is an open system and because that means there can be a certain  amount of differentiation between the various countries, and  second, because the various possible forms of cooperation mean  that it can be adapted to local peculiarities.    [Delstanche] Does firing 129 journalists from the state  radio  represent a method that is compatible with Western norms  regarding the freedom of the press?    [Goncz] The important thing is to understand that it is  compatible with the norms regarding freedom of the press as  enshrined in the Hungarian Constitution. The provisions of the  Hungarian Constitution stipulate quite unambiguously that the  freedom of the press be respected, as must citizens' rights to  express their opinions. Since until now we have not had any law  governing the media, a law that sets out the situation and  position regarding electronic media, for the time being it is up  to the government to ensure the impartiality of the media while  we wait for such a law to be enacted. I fervently hope that the  government will meet this obligation.    I would like to add that in Hungary we have set up a  democratic institutional system. This system is working, but in  a fledgling democracy there is also a need to learn the  unwritten rules, which takes some time. I am not certain that  the preelectoral period is the best time to learn them.    [Delstanche] Hungary is often cited as the pioneer of  economic and political reforms in Central and Eastern Europe.  However, the discontentment seems to be increasing, not only in  the political arena, but also at the economic level. What  adjustments do you intend to make to your economic strategy?    [Goncz] We were indeed pioneers regarding economic  transformation, for the reforms introduced in Hungary preceded  those launched in other countries by roughly 10 years. And I am  absolutely certain that there will be no drastic change.  Firstly, because we have three priorities at the economic  level: We must bring inflation under control, get to grips with  the budget deficit, and reduce the rate of unemployment.    These three objectives are calling for compromises on a  daily  basis. This means to say that any government which comes to  power will be obliged to take account of economic realities.    It is true that at the economic level, society was expecting  a greater share of the new power. However, it started out with  a sizeable foreign debt. Moreover, the country, the government,  and society were no more prepared for the collapse of the  markets in the East than they were for the economic decline that  has prevailed in Western Europe.    Throughout the region the crisis is rampant, and we will  only  have put the situation behind us when we manage to increase  production, which has dropped in all the countries. In  addition, our region will constitute the largest market for  Western Europe in the near future. However, for us to be able  to welcome its products and prove to be solvent, the Western  markets must definitely be opened up. To have one market,  another market must be assured in return. That is in our common  interests.    [Delstanche] The polls are predicting that the Socialist  Party will win the elections. Do you accept the interpretation  according to which the success of this party is provoked by the  economic difficulties caused by the transition, and do you see  any danger in this apparent rise of the socialists?    [Goncz] No result can be prejudged, and in my capacity as  head of state, I am bound over to bow to the opinions of the  electorate. However, regardless of whichever party or coalition  comes to power, it is certain that the priorities regarding  foreign policy will not change. For from this point of view  there is a complete consensus at national level. The economic  priorities will remain the same, for if we are really seeking to  join the international community, we cannot do an about-turn.  So it is up to the electorate to decide how we might succeed in  meeting these priorities, which will remain unaltered.</p>

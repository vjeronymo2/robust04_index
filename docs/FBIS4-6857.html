			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- A 130-member joint  parliamentary group was formed in the House of Representatives  on Monday [25 April] to support newly elected Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata. The group, called "Kaishin" (Renovation),  comprises Hata's 62-member Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], the  37-member Japan New Party (JNP) led by Hata's predecessor as  premier Morihiro Hosokawa, the 19-member Democratic Socialist  Party (DSP), the seven-member Liberal Party and the four-member  Kaikaku no Kai, party officials said.    Toshio Yamaguchi, an independent member, also joined the  bloc.    The Liberal Party led by Koji Kakizawa and Kaikaku no Kai  led  by Takeo Nishioka were formed by defectors from the opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).    New Party Mirai (Future), another five-member LDP breakaway,  did not join "Kaishin" but plans to take part in the future, a  senior Shinseito official said.    DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi urged the formation of a new joint  alliance, saying, "we should create a strongly united grouping  to support new Prime Minister Hata." Ouchi made the call in a  meeting of DSP legislators.    However, new party Sakigake [Harbinger] head Masayoshi  Takemura, the chief cabinet secretary in the Hosokawa cabinet,  rejected the scheme.    Sakigake, poised to distance itself from the dominant  Shinseito-Komeito alliance in the coalition, has pledged not to  take a post in the new government but voted for Hata in the  prime ministerial vote in the Diet.    Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the 74-member Social  Democratic Party (SDP), expressed displeasure with the move  toward a joint alliance, saying, "I cannot say it is good or  bad. But also I cannot say `please do as you like'."    DSP sources said Ouchi and Shinseito Secretary General  Ichiro  Ozawa, the chief strategist in the coalition, met secretly at  the end of last week and agreed on the formation of a new joint  parliamentary group.    Hosokawa called for the creation of a joint parliamentary  group, called "Kaikaku" (Reform), with other coalition parties  in the lower house on April 8 when he announced his sudden  resignation.    The idea had been frozen because of criticism from Sakigake  [Harbinger] and the SDP, which charged that such a proposal  would lead to the formation of a large new party amalgamating  the JNP, Shinseito and Komeito.</p>

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Kept strictly under lock and key / A visit to a vault in Birmingham to see what safe deposit centres have to offer PETER Thomas guides the guest through the small rooms that lead to the vault, under the unremitting gaze of television surveillance cameras. 'No, don't try and open that door until this one is shut. That's it. There's the click.' Here, floor to ceiling, are the locked deposit boxes containing who knows what. Jewellery certainly, documents, cash, the items that people would rather lock up. This, in a leafy suburb and next door to Botanic Gardens, is the Birmingham Deposit Centre and Thomas is the chairman and managing director of it. The heart of the centre is a concrete box with 2ft-thick walls and ceiling and a steel mesh running through the concrete to dissipate the effect of any explosives attack. Entry to the vault is through a door weighing 5.5 tonnes, cluttered with combination and time locks, on the inside of which is a glass shell which itself would explode on impact, thrusting bars into the surrounding walls. But then, you can not be too careful with other peoples' valuables, especially if they are paying you to look after them. Excluding facilities offered by banks, there is only one safe deposit centre outside London and this is it. Birmingham Deposit Centre opened in 1989, the first to be built in the UK since the break-in at a centre in Knightsbridge, London, four years ago. The first safe deposit centre opened at Chancery Lane in the City of London in 1875. It was a handy place for lawyers and City gents to put their deeds and share certificates, but there were no others until Knightsbridge opened in 1981. Since, another 11 have opened in London. Safe deposit centres have never caught on in the UK. According to Thomas, only one-in-1,000 Britons has a safe deposit box in a purpose-built centre. That compares with one-in-three in Sweden, one-in-five in France and one-in-10 in the US. He explains the century-long gap in building a UK safe deposit centre as 'reluctance to take security seriously by private individuals'. Birmingham Deposit Centre has 3,500 boxes, of which about 1,000 are regularly in use. Most of the clients are from the Asian community: they are familiar with the concept of safe deposit centres and they also like to lock away the dowry jewellery. The British, if they have anything to lock away, usually just take the articles to the bank. Not that the banks are particularly enthusiastic about a safe custody service: bankers doubt whether they cover their costs in providing the service. Charges at banks and deposit centres depend on the size of the box rented. At Birmingham Deposit Centre, rental of a box runs from Pounds 99 to Pounds 1,350 a year, but access is unlimited and without charge, and the rental includes Pounds 25,000 of all-risks insurance cover. That cover applies both inside the centre and outside for 60 days a year. At Barclays Bank there are three tiers of charge: Pounds 20 for an envelope for a year with no charge for access; renting a small box costs Pounds 20 a year but with a Pounds 6 a visit charge if more than three visits are made a quarter; a large box costs Pounds 40 a year with the same access charge as for a small box. Birmingham Deposit Centre and Barclays quote their charges exclusive of VAT. Barclays offers no insurance cover but holders of a Premier card receive free safe deposit facilities. A greater awareness of security needs and more cost consciousness among the banks suggest that safe deposit centres will spread. Thomas notes that the number of domestic burglaries in Sweden has dropped since the spread of such centres there. A deposit centre can also store computer data: company insurance premiums are often lower if crucial computer data is stored off-site. Birmingham Deposit Centre is also talking about a joint venture with the Law Society for a system of registering and storing wills. Individual companies are planning new safe deposit centres in Bristol, Edinburgh, Leeds, Leicester and Manchester, but entry is not cheap. Birmingham Deposit Centre, 75 per cent owned by Pertemps, the recruitment agency group, and 25 per cent by the management, spent Pounds 2m on setting up its facilities. If there is to be public confidence in the security and probity of such centres, standards for their operation may need to be established. A Home Office committee, of which Thomas is a member, is now considering the possibility of legislation to meet that point.</p>

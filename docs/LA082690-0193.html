			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DROPOUT PLAN GIVES STUDENTS RESPONSIBILITY;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: MORE THAN A THIRD OF THE CLASS OF 1989 DROPPED OUT IN THE NORWALK-LA  MIRADA DISTRICT. SO OFFICIALS ARE BORROWING AN APPROACH THAT HAS HAD REMARKABLE  SUCCESS.  </P> <P> During the last six years, Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District officials  have started one program after another aimed at staunching the flow of students  who enter high schools then drop out before graduating.  </P> <P> But each year the dropout rate has crept higher, peaking with the class of  1989, when a little more than a third of the class dropped out during the three  years before graduation.  </P> <P> "We're at a place in this district where we've got to do something," board  President William White said. "We have some programs, but they just haven't  been working out."  </P> <P> Convinced that traditional stay-in-school programs, such as dropout counseling  and independent study programs, are just not enough, the district board last  week approved spending $1.3 million on a program that officials hope will lure  students back to the classroom.  </P> <P> The plan is modeled after a highly successful program in the Sweetwater school  district in southwestern San Diego County, which slashed the dropout rate from  about 40% to 8% in five years, said Elias Galvan, the director of secondary  education for the Norwalk-La Mirada district.  </P> <P> Galvan, who visited the Sweetwater district four times during the summer to  interview staff members, students and parents, said the plan calls for students  to sign a contract agreeing they will attend one hour of computer courses and  one hour of teacher-instructed courses a day.  </P> <P> A counselor will also be hired to work with the students.  </P> <P> Galvan said after students spend two hours at school, they are free to go home.  Sometime during the day, however, they must spend three to four more hours on  home study. The students are expected to bring the work they completed at home  to school the next day to discuss with the teacher, he said.  </P> <P> Students can attend their two hourlong courses any time from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.,  but they must clock in when they arrive, Galvan said.  </P> <P> "The program brings in high technology, counseling, teaching, the use of time  -- all the things we have ever talked about," Galvan said.  </P> <P> But, Galvan and some board members said, what makes the program most attractive  to the students interviewed in San Diego is its flexibility, despite the use of  a contract and time cards.  </P> <P> "Let's face it," Galvan said, "the youngsters are not going to enroll in a  program if they don't like it. But in this program they say, 'I only have to be  in school only two hours a day. I am trusted to do my own work. I am  responsible for my own progress.'  </P> <P> "I talked to many kids, and I didn't find one that gave me negative feelings  about the plan."  </P> <P> Board member Bruce Butler, who visited Sweetwater last month, said: "Rather  then forcing the student to fit into our schedule, we fit into their schedule."  </P> <P> Butler said he and district officials are so convinced that the program will  work for them that they are willing to invest $200,000 on computer equipment  and spend thousands more on staff, classroom preparation and other materials.  </P> <P> "We're going to lose some money at first," Butler said, but district officials  are counting on the program to pay for itself eventually, because the state  will reimburse the district about $3,000 per student who attends school daily.  </P> <P> The program must enroll about 350 students to generate enough money to keep it  running, he said.  </P> <P> Butler said district officials estimate that it could take up to two years to  reach that figure.  </P> <P> Galvan said the district plans to begin recruiting dropout students immediately  and will cull the lists of dropouts kept by the district, as well as spread the  word on campus, churches and community centers.  </P> <P> The two centers at La Mirada High School and Norwalk High School will probably  be ready for the students by October, he said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> ACTRESS FINDS SOUTH 'RACIST'  </P> <P> "Pretty Woman" actress Julia Roberts described her stay in these parts as  boring and the people as racist.  </P> <P> She stayed in Spartanburg and Abbeville, in the state's northwestern corner,  during filming of "Sleeping With the Enemy" in May.  </P> <P> "The people were horribly racist and I had a really hard time," Rolling Stone  magazine quoted Roberts as saying in the Aug. 9 issue.  </P> <P> "In Abbeville, I felt so assaulted and insulted by these people that I just  didn't want to be nice anymore," she said.  </P> <P> Abbeville Mayor Joe Savitz said her remarks may stem from her attempt to take a  black friend into a "real redneck-type place" that doesn't allow black  customers.  </P> <P> "No self-respecting person would want to go there," Savitz said.  </P> <P> In her latest movie, Roberts portrays an abused wife who stages her death and  assumes a new identity. It is scheduled for release in February.  </P></p>

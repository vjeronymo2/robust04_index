			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Three men win ruling on equal pensions AN industrial tribunal has ruled that three men who left a Wigan engineering company before the retirement age of 65 were entitled to the same pension as women of their age. The judgment reinforces others on equal pension ages. The Equal Opportunities Commission said the judgment in the case against Gullick Dobson showed again that sex discrimination in occupational pension schemes was illegal because pensions must be considered as part of pay.</p>

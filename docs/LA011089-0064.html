			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPORT FAULTS COMMANDERS OF MARINE WHO DIED IN DESERT  </P> <P> "Poor planning" and a "total breakdown" in the chain of command were to blame  in the death of Marine Lance Cpl. Jason J. Rother, 19, during desert training  exercises at Twentynine Palms last summer, according a report released Monday  by Marine Corps headquarters.  </P> <P> The conduct of Rother's commanders "contradicts every principle of concerned  leadership on which we (Marines) have traditionally prided ourselves," Marine  Corps Commandant Gen. Al Gray said in a statement.  </P> <P> Gray said that the battalion commander and executive officers should be held  accountable for the tragedy. Gray had ordered the second, more comprehensive  investigation of Rother's disappearance after the man's parents complained to  the media and congressional leaders last fall that not enough had been done to  find their son.  </P> <P> An initial investigation by the battalion commander, Lt. Col. E. J. Robeson IV,  led to court-martial charges being filed against Rother's immediate superiors.  </P> <P> Left behind last August when his unit pulled out after three days and nights of  live-fire combat training at the 932-square-mile Marine Corps Air Ground Combat  Center in the high desert, Rother wasn't reported missing for nearly 48 hours.  His body was found Dec. 4 during a training exercise by a San Bernardino County  sheriff's search and rescue unit.  </P> <P> Carrying only three 1-quart canteens of water, the young Marine had managed to  hike 17 miles in 110-degree daytime temperatures before he collapsed and died a  mile from a busy highway, according to desert survival experts from nearby  Joshua Tree National Monument who helped locate the body.  </P> <P> Initially, Robeson relieved Rother's company commander and platoon leader of  their commands. In addition, he ordered that the two sergeants and a lieutenant  who had dealt directly with Rother be tried for dereliction of duty and other  charges.  </P> <P> On Monday, Gray ordered a review of the roles played by Robeson and his  executive officer, Maj. Tony L. Holm, according to Marine spokesman Lt. Col.  Fred Peck. Gray's statement said, "Based upon additional recommendations made  by the investigating officer . . . the commanding general of the 2nd Marine  Division has been directed to . . . take appropriate action with respect to the  battalion commander and the battalion executive officer of Rother's unit."  </P> <P> Rother's death "was not an accident," Gray stated in the release. "His death  didn't just happen. . . . It was the certain and foreseeable result of an  attitude which I intend to erase from our corps."  </P> <P> On Aug. 30, the final night of the rigorous 72-hour combat exercise, Rother's  battalion was ordered to make a motorized night march through a mountain pass  and across the remote desert. Rother was posted at a checkpoint, one of several  road guides directing traffic in the wilderness. When the guides were picked up  before dawn, Rother was somehow left behind.  </P> <P> Investigators "concluded that poor planning and direction in the placement and  recovery" of the road guides "caused the failure to pick him up." Investigators  termed the failure to report Rother missing a "total breakdown" in the chain of  personnel accountability.  </P> <P> Rother was assigned to a squad under the command of Platoon Sgt. Christopher  Clyde. Clyde's court-martial is scheduled to start today. He and Squad Sgt.  Thomas Turnell -- whose court-martial is scheduled for Jan. 24 -- are accused  of being derelict in their duties for not keeping track of Rother. They also  face charges of going on unauthorized leave right after the exercise ended,  according to officials.  </P> <P> Lt. Allen V. Lawson, who placed Rother at the checkpoint, has been charged with  dereliction of duty for failing to post the guides in pairs, as ordered, and  for failing to account for Rother's whereabouts and welfare. Lawson is  currently subject to a pretrial investigation, officials said.  </P></p>

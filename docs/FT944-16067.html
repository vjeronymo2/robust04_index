			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Russians ask who to blame for rouble row Even by Russia's remarkable standards, this has been a strange week. On 'Black Tuesday' the currency lost more than a fifth of its value. Two days later it surged 20 per cent. By the end of the week, Russia had a new finance minister, a gap at the head of the Central Bank, a full-blown political row and a confused public. One can only pity the writer of the briefing papers for the International Monetary Fund's mission, starting work in Moscow next week. The Moskovskaya Pravda newspaper's headline summed up the mood of the country. 'There are two eternal Russian questions: Who is to blame? What to do?' it said. Characteristically, President Boris Yeltsin had few doubts on either score, sacking the acting finance minister, urging Mr Victor Gerashchenko, head of the Central Bank, to quit, and setting up a commission  -including the repackaged KGB - to investigate the whole affair. Many people have been blamed for Tuesday's currency stampede, including speculators, communists, and western spies, although no-one can give a convincing reason for the scale or speed of the fall. Well informed reform supporters believe it reflected an attempt by conservative ministers to tarnish reform. There may be something to this line but - like most Russian conspiracy theories - it is ultimately unprovable. Besides, the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange (Micex) is a small market and prone to volatility. Speculation can easily assume a momentum of its own. It is simpler, though, to see why the rouble came under heavy selling pressure in previous weeks: the lowering of interest rates, the seasonal increase in credits to the state sector and the rise in inflation from 4 per cent a month in August to almost 8 in September. The government's critics - most prominently, Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former finance minister - claimed the rouble's fall was the natural consequence of this monetary loosening. 'If the government wants to know why the rouble fell they only have to look in the mirror,' said one currency trader. This demonstration of the market's power may have created a climate for change and the government appears set to take a decisive step forward - or back. Indecision could be dangerous. Russian economists predict inflation may rise to 15 per cent in October, partly as a result of the currency moves, putting further pressure on the rouble. Currency traders suggest the Central Bank has been left with slender reserves with which to defend itself. The government has drawn up a tough budget for 1995, forecasting a fall in inflation to 1 per cent a month by the year-end. It may press the IMF to back a strong stabilisation plan. Mr Jeffrey Sachs, the Harvard economics professor and former adviser to the Russian government, believes it is not too late to make the rouble a stable currency so long as it is backed by an IMF stabilisation fund. 'The costs of not doing so could be catastrophic if Russia falls prey to monetary panic and hyperinflation. But the first test is whether the Russians themselves are prepared to live by the rules rather than the often reckless discretion of powerful political figures,' he says.</p>

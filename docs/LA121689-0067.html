			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CUTTING MEDICAL COSTS OF DEATH TO PROVIDE MORE CARE FOR LIVING  </P> <P> As a respiratory therapist and health care giver in private and county  hospitals for the last 13 years, I applaud Schram's column. I would like to  take the discussion one step farther to include not only the terminally ill but  the older patient as well; specifically the older patient whose quality of life  has deteriorated. There is big money in warehousing the elderly. Many private  hospitals have established their own nursing homes or extended care facilities.  </P> <P> Schram discussed the emotion of denial. This is also the time to discuss the  emotion of guilt -- the guilt experienced by families who feel they did not do  "everything" for their loved one long after the quality of life had trickled  away.  </P> <P> JOANN LORING  </P> <P> San Pedro  </P></p>

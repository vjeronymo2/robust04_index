			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Observer: Class-conscious A charter has come to the aid of Citizen Major. On his first foreign trip since the election victory, the prime minister is travelling around Central Europe on an aircraft more used to ferrying holidaymakers on cut-price package tours. When Major decided three weeks ago to travel to Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, the RAF regretted there were simply no VC10s available to accommodate him and his entourage. So John and Norma find themselves on an ancient BAC 1-11 chartered from British Air Ferries. When introduced in the 1960s, the aircraft was undoubtedly ahead of its time but in more recent years has been consigned to the Stansted-Jersey holiday run. Major may be unphased by having to sit in economy just a few rows ahead of the travelling press. But the class-conscious political hacks have already pledged themselves to decorous silence if on future trips the man of the people opts for an aeroplane more appropriate to their status.</p>

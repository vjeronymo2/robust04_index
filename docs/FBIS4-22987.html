			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. Lavrentyev, metrologist, Kosmicheskaya Svyaz </F> GP: ``Conference in Dubno'']    [Text] A scientific-technical conference titled ``Satellite  Communication Systems in the Transition to Digital Methods of  Data Transmission and Their Metrological Support'' was held here  in June. Opening it, Yu. M. Fomin, chairman of the organizing  committee and chief engineer of the Kosmicheskaya Svyaz GP [not  further identified], noted that one of the main trends in the  development of radio communication resources is transmission of  different types of information by digital methods. This trend is  determined by the qualitative indicators of digital  communication channels, by the possibility of using them to  transmit all kinds of information, and by the existence of a  promising foundation of digital components upon which to base  the equipment.    Academician V. L. Bykov, a pioneer in space communications  in  our country and the founder and permanent scientific leader of  an international experimental satellite communications center,  which is leading the effort to introduce the new 14-11 GHz  frequency band, gave a report on the topic ``Problems of  Introducing New Frequency Bands in Satellite Communication and  Broadcasting Systems.'' The academician described work being  done in this field in foreign countries, in Japan for example,  where they are not introducing the 14-11 GHZ band, having  upgraded directly to the 30-20 GHz band; he also discussed  creation of a unified world communication system and work in the  field of digital television.    Doctor of Technical Sciences, Professor A. A. Pirogov, a  well  known scientist, reported on his new theoretical work ``On the  Need of Accounting for Time-Weighted Nonlinear Distortions in  Telephony.'' Because transmission of telephone messages makes up  a considerable share of the load of the satellite-borne relay  stations of satellite communication systems, it is important to  account not only for nonlinear distortions in the  analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion channels at  maximum telephone signal level, but also for mean  (time-weighted) nonlinear distortions. The report's author  established in his research that even maximum distortions  K[.sub]tmax[/]=24 percent at a signal level of  X[.sub]max[/]=1 are practically unnoticeable, while  relatively small distortions turn out to be significant at  X=(0.15-0.25)X[.sub]max[/]. A. A. Pirogov proposed a formula  making it possible to normalize the mean (time-weighted)  harmonic coefficient K[.sub]&Ggr;[/],   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-55A>      FORMULA </FIG>    [Text]In addition in the case of telephone  signal transmission to input and output circuits by the discrete  amplitude modulation or single side band methods, in order to  reduce distortions and raise the efficiency of amplifiers at the  voltage of power supplies, regulation ``by the envelope'' of the  modulated signal should be abandoned in favor of doing so ``by  the envelope'' of level X of the modulated signal, determined by  syllabic frequencies F[.sub]max[/]=75 Hz, as is widely done  abroad. This improves signal quality, raises efficiency, and  does not cause appearance of emissions outside the band.    In his other report, ``Discrete Representation of Semantic  (Meaningful) Symbols of Speech or Telephone  Signals--Conversation Via a Low-Speed Telegraph Channel and  Microphone Control of Machines,'' A. A. Pirogov noted that  hundreds of thousands of discrete low-capacity channels should  become the most important field of application of space  communication systems. If a single standard channel can transmit  discrete information at a speed of up to 100-200 Mbits/sec  (given a certain easing of the requirements on the error  probability to P=10[.sup]-3[/]), we can also use it to  organize N=(0.4-1.3)|b10[.sup]6[/] partial discrete  communication channels of low capacity of 150-250 bits/sec each,  or N=(0.83-3.3)|b10[.sup]5[/] vocoder channels with a  capacity of 1.2-0.6 kbits/sec. Such channels, which are very  inexpensive and reliable, are extremely necessary in Russia's  vast territory. Eight million vocoders servicing congressmen,  business, farmers and others are presently operating in the  public switching network of the USA. Experience in creating such  space communication channels of even lower capacity already  exists in the world (INMARSAT--emergency buoys). The speaker  noted that serious attention needs to be turned to something he  proposed as much as 30 years ago--using maximally effective  primary description of telephone (speech) signals on the basis  of the phonetic (semantic) function    P(_o_,t)=lg [S(_o_,t)/s(_o_,t-_t_)].    where S is the spectral density of the signal at frequency  _o_. In 1977 the French scientist Lenar [transliteration] used  this algorithm to break the French language down into an  alphabet of 627 semantic elements (diphons), and now the French  can converse on discrete channels with a capacity of 150-250  bits/sec, control machines with a microphone, and identify a  voice at the input of an analog-to-digital converter.    Interest was shown in a report by Doctor of Technical  Sciences, Professor N. T. Petrovich on the topic`` Problems of  Radio Contact With Extraterrestrial Civilizations,'' in which he  summarized some results of international theoretical and  experimental efforts to reveal possible signals from  civilizations on other planets. The main conclusion is that  extraterrestrial civilizations probably exist, and are sending  us signals. By improving the search for them and the methods of  their reception, in the professor's opinion radio contact could  be established with them.    V. Kalachev, a representative of the USA's well-known  Hewlett-Packard, expressed his gratefulness for the invitation  to the conference, and described his firm and its readiness to  cooperate.    A report by Candidate of Technical Sciences K. I.  Martyshevskiy, a laboratory chief at the NIIR [not further  identified],`` Methods and Resources for Measuring Onboard  Satellite Communication Relay Stations on the Ground and in  Flight Design Tests,'' was devoted to problems associated with  testing multichannel satellite-borne communication and  broadcasting relay stations of satellite communication systems.  Methods of measuring the main parameters of relay stations such  as the amplitude-frequency characteristic, GVZ [not further  identified], K[.sub]y[/], noise, frequency instability, and  channel indicators were examined, and a block diagram and the  principal qualitative indicators of an automated testing complex  (AIK) for conducting the complete cycle of ground testing of all  types on relay stations carried by the Gals direct television  broadcasting system were presented. The AIK can measure the  technical characteristics of any channel of a satellite-borne  relay station, and record measurements automatically by computer.    Reports by NIIR chief metrologist E. V. Tetiyevskiy and  TsISM  (VISM) [not further identified] Metrology Department chief N.  Ya. Medovikov were devoted to the problems of certification and  metrological support.    Norms of the International Telegraph and Telephone  Consultative Committee pertaining to the error factor, slip and  phase jitter, the methods of measuring them with and without  interrupting communication, and the characteristics of modern  Russian and foreign digital measuring instruments were presented.    V. V. Filippov, assistant chief engineer of the Kontakt  Production Association, described instruments manufactured by  the production association.</p>

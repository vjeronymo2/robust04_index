			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [`SEGODNYA'-INTERFAX report under the "Money" rubric: </F> "Council of Ministers Ponders Freezing of Ruble Rate While  Central Bank of Russia Ponders Letting Western Banks Into the  Country"]    [Text] The government of Russia is not working now to  further sharply reduce inflation, which is already running as  low as 8-9 percent a month; instead it intends primarily to  ensure "stability" of the money market, Sergey Vasilyev,  Russian Federation deputy minister of the economy, stated at  the "New Aspects of Reforming Russia's Economy" congress which  opened in Moscow on Tuesday.    The gradual forming of a fixed ruble rate (instead of the  current floating one) could, to Sergey Vasilyev's mind, become  one of the mechanisms to fight, among other things, the  "dollarization" of the economy. It is this, Mr. Vasilyev  stated, that makes it possible to strengthen Russia's national  currency. Remarkably, the deputy minister of the economy  pointed out, the formation of positive bank rates provides for  the growth of ruble accumulations in the country right now.    In the meantime, Russian Central Bank Deputy Chairman  Aleksandr Khandruyev stated yesterday that Russia could give  foreign banks, as early as the beginning of this summer, a  broader access to the country. Mr. Khandruyev thinks the  country's banks are already strong enough to offer serious  competition to Western banks. At the same time Mr. Khandruyev  ventured a guess that foreign banks would respond "without any  particular enthusiasm" to the decision to give them broader  access to Russia.    It is also worthwhile mentioning in this connection that  Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin signed an edict back  on 13 November 1993 that limited "temporarily, for the period  till 1 January 1996," activities of foreign banks on the  territory of Russia to servicing non-residents alone. However,  even before the signing of this presidential edict, Russian  Federation Central Bank licenses for banking operations were  received, among others, by the Credit Lyonnais, the Bank of  Australia, the Societe Generale-Vostok, the Bank of China, the  BNP-Dresdner Bank, the Credit Suisse, CitiBank, and the Chase  Manhattan Bank, which have in the meantime familiarized  themselves sufficiently with the none-too-simple realities of a  peculiar Russian market.</p>

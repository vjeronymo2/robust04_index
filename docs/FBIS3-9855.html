			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Lucie </F> Weissova in Prague on 29 March--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Weissova] Prime Minister, representatives of  the coalition parties held yet another meeting yesterday because  there have been rumors that there are some clashes in the  coalition. Jan Kalvoda, for instance, said a few days ago that  he was dissatisfied with the method of communication in the  coalition. I would like to ask you whether things have cleared  up after the meeting and whether you reached a consensus on the  disputed issues.    [Klaus] No agreement has been reached because the  differences  are not caused by lack of communication. This is simply a rumor  that is being constantly spread around by someone. The  differences exist because of differing views, because of  differing approaches to the various issues we are currently  facing. Naturally, these differences do not apply to the 95  percent of matters of everyday importance.    The differences lie in several evergreens, so to speak. On  the one hand, there are the restitution-related issues, and, on  the other, there is the creation of the senate, a new chamber in  our parliament. In my view, the need for this chamber is very  disputable. The third issue is formed by the contentious  problems related to the regional setup, the issues that stir the  whole country.    Thus our views do indeed differ, and in no case can they be  related to lack of communication.    [Weissova] Let us return to your recent visit to Finland. In  your own words, one of the experiences you brought with you from  there was that the admission into the European Union does not  need to be a cure all, and that, especially at the beginning, it  might bring certain disadvantages. Does this mean that you  share with the so-called Euroskeptics their worries about the  Brussels bureaucracy, which, by the way, is formed mainly by  people from governing European Socialist parties?    [Klaus] [passage omitted] This bureaucracy is not a  fundamental problem of the European Community. It is, rather, a  complementary problem that is above the fundamental problem. In  my view, the fundamental question is something else: what the  concept of European integration is, to what degree it really  means a general opening of various obstacles, movements of  people, ideas, goods, money, and various other things all over  Europe--which we support wholeheartedly--and to what extent it  is an attempt to force upon people a specific ideology, specific  unity, specific compulsory common solutions, and thousands of  other things. This is not Euroskeptism; this is Eurorealism.  This is simply searching for a sensible social setup in Europe.  I always say that the important thing is not whether there will  be 12 or 16 or 20 countries, but what system of relations  between the individual and the state will prevail in this  situation.</p>

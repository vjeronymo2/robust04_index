			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi VNA May 31 -- `Vietnam and the United States  should build their normal relations and cooperation in a  constructive spirit' said Deputy Prime Minister Tran Duc Luong  in an interview to the army paper `QUAN DOI NHAN DAN' at the end  of his ten-day visit to the U.S.    On the US businessmen's assessment of investment and  business  opportunities in Vietnam, Mr Luong noted that the US business  circle recognized Vietnam as a big market with more than 72  million customers in a favourable area in a region of fast,  dynamically developing economics. Many American companies, he  added, are now urging the US Government to fully normalize its  relations with Vietnam and soon give the country the 'most  favourable national' status so that they can have favourable  conditions to do business in this prospective and potential  market.    Asked about the fields of potential cooperation between the  two countries, the deputy prime minister said that American  companies were interested in all fields that Vietnam was calling  for foreign investment. The two sides, he said, have the same  interest in such important fields as oil and gas, post and  telecommunications, electronics, informations, and so on. Apart  from investment in industry, Mr. Luong went on, financial and  banking activists of high prestige in the United States would  soon come to Vietnam.    On the prospects of the relations between the two countries,  Deputy Prime Minister Luong said strategically the two countries  have realized the need to build normal relations leading to  cooperative and friendly relations in a constructive spirit.  This is a persistent principled standpoint, he stressed.</p>

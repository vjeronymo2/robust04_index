			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFTER WIN, BLUE JAYS ARE ONE OUT WITH THREE LEFT  </P> <P> This was beyond winning ugly, a new low in the era of parody, a slapstick  showdown.  </P> <P> Fred McGriff, the Toronto Blue Jays' first baseman, provided the perspective  after a 10-5 victory over the Boston Red Sox Sunday.  </P> <P> "It was a win and those things don't have to be pretty to make you happy,"  McGriff said.  </P> <P> Happy is being one game back of the Red Sox in the American League East  compared to three back with three to play. Happy is preventing the Red Sox from  clinching a tie for the division title.  </P> <P> The Blue Jays did it by salvaging Sunday's series finale, assembling 19 hits  off a parade of Boston pitchers in overcoming their own parade of sins.  </P> <P> "We didn't play that well, but they played worse," Toronto relief pitcher Tom  Henke said of the Red Sox. "We were fortunate to score a lot of runs."  </P> <P> Now the Blue Jays end the regular season with a lockout-created, three-game  series in Baltimore. They have a 7-3 record against the Orioles, including 2-1  at Memorial Stadium.  </P> <P> The Red Sox remain at Fenway Park, playing host to the Chicago White Sox and a  former Boston landmark named Carlton Fisk in a three-game series. The White  Sox, at 93-66, have a better record than either the Red Sox or Blue Jays and  swept a four-game series from Boston at Comiskey Park less than two weeks ago.  </P> <P> They are 5-4 against the Red Sox, but 0-3 in Boston, where Fisk, with 16 homers  since his departure, is second to Gary Gaetti among active opposition.  </P> <P> Fisk, in fact, has tormented the Red Sox since leaving as a free agent. He has  a .321 average, 27 homers and 64 runs batted in in 87 games against Boston.  </P> <P> "Carlton is a good guy to have going for us," said Jimmy Key, Toronto's winning  pitcher Sunday. "The Red Sox definitely have the tougher team to play now.  </P> <P> "Chicago has a better record than either of us and they're probably saying that  they're better than both of us. And they've got a point."  </P> <P> Key conceded, however, that a three-game sweep against the Orioles might not be  enough for the Blue Jays, that at best it might only create a one-game division  playoff Thursday at the SkyDome.  </P> <P> At this point, however, the Blue Jays would settle for that.  </P> <P> "If we had lost today it would have been over," Key said. "This division has  been crazy all year, and we have to feel that maybe we've put a little doubt  back in Boston's mind."  </P> <P> The Red Sox live with doubt, the residue of their failures in other autumns,  but they applied their best cliches to Sunday's inability to clinch a tie by  sweeping the series.  </P> <P> "Today would have been icing on the cake," Jody Reed said, "but we have to  remember that we won two of three and that's what we wanted to do. We're still  in the driver's seat. If we take two out of three from Chicago, they've got to  sweep in Baltimore (for a tie)."  </P> <P> Wade Boggs dismissed the sloppy nature of Sunday's game by saying that a loss  is a loss, and also dismissed the recent four-game sweep of the Red Sox in  Chicago.  </P> <P> "The consensus among our guys is that nobody likes Comiskey Park," he said.  "It's a bad hitters' park. We have more confidence here and that shows in our  record against them. We're going to be loosey-goosey."  </P> <P> Cynics might say that already frayed collars were beginning to tighten Sunday  for both sides.  </P> <P> Boggs and catcher Tony Pena made errors that compounded the Blue Jays'  offensive onslaught. Shortstop Luis Rivera showed limited range when he could  only deflect a pair of first-inning grounders, producing a quick Toronto lead.  Left fielder Mike Greenwell made an unwise and errant throw that set up one  other Toronto run.  </P> <P> The Blue Jays stranded 13 runners, had two others thrown out at second and  third, saw Mookie Wilson mimic Greenwell with a misguided throw that set up a  Boston run and watched George Bell play left field in a manner that would have  made Carl Yastrzemski shudder.  </P> <P> The Red Sox had 10 hits, including Tom Brunansky's fifth home run of the  series, but after rebounding from a 4-1 deficit to forge a 4-4 tie in the  fourth, they fell behind for good in the fifth on a tie-breaking homer by  Junior Felix and a two-run single by McGriff, a grounder through the left side  of the infield that Boston Manager Joe Morgan called "the luckiest hit of the  day."  </P> <P> Greg Harris, the Boston starter, faced 12 batters and eight reached base as he  pitched 1 2/3 innings, allowing five hits and four runs. Joe Hesketh, released  previously this year by the Montreal Expos and Atlanta Braves, faced 17 batters  as Harris' successor and 11 reached base, allowing eight hits and three runs in  2 2/3 innings, including the decisive hits by Felix and McGriff.  </P> <P> Harris, a 13-game winner as the No. 3 Boston starter and a converted reliever  who had started only once in the previous two years, represents a real trouble  spot for the Red Sox if they make the playoffs. He has lost his last four  starts, permitting 27 hits and 19 earned runs in 16 innings.  </P> <P> "Every time I went to a fastball today they hit it," he said. "If I pitch in  the playoffs it will be with eight days rest and maybe that's what it will  take."  </P> <P> Harris and the Red Sox, of course, hope to find out.  </P></p>

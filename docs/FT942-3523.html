			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Probe into possible acquisition of Macy RH Macy, the US stores group, has been informed that the attorney general of New York state has started a formal investigation of the possible acquisition of Macy by Federated Departments Stores, AP-DJ reports from New York. Macy has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy court proceedings since January 1992. A spokesman for Macy confirmed that the investigation by the office of Attorney General G. Oliver Koppell centred on whether a Macy-Federated merger had anti-trust ramifications. Macy said it was asked by the attorney general's office to provide detailed information relating to 'a number of aspects of Macy's business and the competitive environment in its markets as it relates to Federated, as well as to other competitors'. The company said that it planned to co-operate with the attorney general office's request. Federated Depatment Stores has been pursuing Macy since January, when the Cincinnati-based retailer disclosed that it had bought a large amount of Macy debt.</p>

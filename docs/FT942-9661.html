			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: It is quality that counts Sir, Your headline 'Students spurn accountancy jobs' (May 6) reflects neither the content of the story nor the reality of the intake into the accountancy profession. While it is correct that the total intake has fallen, reflecting lower demand among accountancy firms during the recession, a recent survey by Graduate Appointments showed accountancy as the most popular choice of careers among graduates. The high calibre of those seeking training contracts is reflected by the record 74 per cent of graduate entrants last year with first and upper second degrees, and the increase from 467 to 491 in those from Oxbridge. For this year, the figure has increased again - to 78 per cent - while firms report continuing high interest for top graduates for places this September. It was the supply of places available, not student demand, which had fallen. The institute's finances are not threatened as you suggest because the high quality of graduates going through training is ensuring that the numbers qualifying and subsequently joining the institute are keeping the total membership on a rising trend.

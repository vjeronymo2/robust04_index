			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Full text of statement by presidential spokesman Mr. </F> Mihoubi to national media; place and date not given--recorded]    [Text] At the presidency, Mr. Mihoubi met the national  media and read out a statement that revealed the framework of  the national dialogue proceedings with parties, associations,  and personalities since its resumption on 9 March. The full  text of the presidential spokesman's statement follows:    The head of state has always stressed, in his statements to  the nation, his commitment to implement all political, economic,  social, and security targets contained in the platform the  National Dialogue Commission endorsed.    In this framework, a presidential statement on 18 March 1994  was announced on the head of state's intentions to resume  political dialogue and received for that reason national  figures, political parties, economic and social associations.    Accordingly, as of 19 March and until now, the head of state  held discussions during the first phase with national  personalities and representatives of the Movement for Democracy  in Algeria, Party of Algerian Renewal, Ennahda, Ettahadi  movement, National Liberation Front [FLN], Hamas, as well as  representatives of the following social and economic  organizations: National Organization of War Veterans, General  Union of Algerian Workers, National Union of Framers, National  Association of Public Administration Cadres, National  Organization of Martyrs' Sons, National Union of Public  Contractors, confederation of association of managers of local  public enterprises, Confereation of Algeruab employers, genreal  confederation of Algerian economic operators, Union of Algerian  Students, retired staff of the National People's Army and Youth  and women's associations.    During all those meetings, the head of state clarified and  specified what he meant by serious dialogue -- without excluding  anyone -- within the framework of respecting the constitution.  It is a constructive framework capable of bringing together all  Algerians concerned about the country's security and interest of  its people. The head of state stressed that serious dialogue  was such that dealt with current problems facing the nation.  They were urgent problems that required urgent and quick  solutions.    The head of state also said dialogue that did not exclude  anyone and respected the constitution was one that accepted  differences in opinion. However, it was on the condition that  these opinions fell within the framework of respecting the  constitution, that principal law which formed the nation's  common denominator, and was the primary guarantee for the  promotion of democracy.    Accordingly, respect for the constitution rules out all  dialogue with all those who violate it by resorting to violence.  The head of state added that terrorism, violence, and the  attempt to sabotage the country was a matter that necessitated  mobilizing all nationalists to eradicate these phenomena by all  means and methods provided by the law and the country's  sovereignty. He said that the state, on its part, was  determined to shoulder all its responsibilities to confront this  violence and to firmly and continuously fight it. But he added  that the security solution alone was not sufficient.    It is true. Just as it emerged in the platform endorsed by  the national conference, security work must be consolidated by  political action. These culmulative actions are aimed at  tearing out the roots of violence forever from our society.    The president took this opportunity to provide  clarifications  on the contacts he carried out with the dissolved Islamic  Salvation Front [FIS]. In this context, the head of state  reminded that many parties had proposed taking appeasing  measures to put a stop to the phenomenon of violence throughout  the dialogue process by the National Dialogue Commission. At  the same time, the leaders of that suspended movement expressed  their readiness to work towards putting a stop to violence and  restoring calm.    Mr. Lamine Zeroual, who then met personally with FIS  officials in his capacity as national defense minister, got  their commitment to work in that direction. Appeasing measures  were taken by the government, including the release of two FIS  personalities with the agreement of the other detained leaders.  Those two personalities were given a mandate by their  colleagues to carry out the commitments they made to put a stop  to terrorism and for the return of calm and security.    These commitments have not yet been implemented until our  present day. But the head of state insisted on clarifying that  the national values and constitutional principles are  unnegotiable, just as defending the country's unity, security,  and citizens were. During these talks, the head of state  reminded those he spoke to that during the transitional period,  he would remain attentive to epitomize all the aims contained in  the platform endorsed by the national conference. He added that  this result would enable the existence of necessary conditions  for the return to elections, which was everyone's aim.    The head of state expressed his hopes that the dialogue  would  allow the entwining of efforts and collective energy to  epitomize all these aims. The meetings, which the head of state  convened during the last two weeks, recorded vast feelings on  the dangerous state the country was going through. Those he  spoke to said they were prepared to promote this dialogue to  serve the nation's higher interests. Thank you. [end recording]</p>

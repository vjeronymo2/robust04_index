			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Markets: An upset for the banks - Serious Money Implausible as it may seem, it was hard not to feel a twinge of sympathy for the bankers who gathered at the Lombard Street headquarters of the British Bankers' Association to launch their revised code of practice on Tuesday. No sooner had they explained how much the code had improved since the first edition was published two years ago, than the public relations exercise fell apart. Its destroyer was Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading. Banks and building societies had, he said, 'wasted an opportunity to make a step increase in consumer protection'. The most significant gap he identified was a failure to promise to give 'best advice' to bank customers faced with an array of financial products, as the banks themselves move further into selling life insurance, mortgages, investments and pensions. He was also concerned: that the code did not properly deal with the practice of passing bank account details to other companies in the group, which might want to sell them other financial products; about the delay of almost three years in introducing a system that will give customers 14 days' notice of the amount to be be deducted from their accounts for charges and interest payments; and that it contained no specific requirement to notify customers personally when accounts became obsolete and better interest rates were available in other accounts. 'I intend to pursue these issues directly with banks and building societies,' he promised. The Office of Fair Trading said that Sir Bryan had no direct powers to enforce these practices but would use 'moral persuasion'. To judge by initial reactions, Sir Bryan will have to be very persuasive to win over the 289 institutions, which adopt the code voluntarily. He was disappointed with the code. They were unrepentantly disappointed with the 'miserly' nature of his comments about the improvements that had been made - such as the undertaking that customers will be given advance notice of bank and the tightening of procedures for passing customer information within a financial group. Supporters of the code were unimpressed by Sir Bryan's comments about the selling of financial products. They said this subject was already covered in some detail in the Financial Services Act 1986 and the structure of regulation that it established. But the code's exclusion of one of the activities in which banks and societies are growing and are competing most fiercely, raises a basic question about its purpose. Developed as an alternative to the statutory code of practice recommended by the Jack committee on banking law, which reported in the late 1980s, it does set minimum standards for institutions' dealings with personal customers. But the difficulty with a voluntary code, devised by banks and societies, however good their intentions, is that where there is a clash, competitive pressures will usually prove stronger than the code. Competition will sometimes promote the good service that the code sets out. When this happens, competition is more effective in promoting customers' interest than the code could be. Several high street banks and building societies are, for example, committed to introducing pre-notification of charges or have already done so. Yet the code's target date, in order to allow all to meet its requirements, is the end of 1996. Improving the code's standards at the pace of the slowest can thus undermine its effectiveness and limit its value in supporting a customer's complaint. In other areas, the code's provisions seem too weak or irrelevant to withstand the pressure to exploit a warm customer base. Marks and Spencer, for example, has not signed up to the code in spite of the financial services it provides, because it wants to make full use across its operations of the customer information it acquires in financial services. The UK's most profitable retailer must believe that this advantage outweighs the possibility that some customers may decide against taking out an M&amp;S personal loan on the grounds that the retailer has not adopted the banking code. Similarly, Barclays, which used to insist on the right to pass the details of new personal bank accounts, to other parts of the group, would doubtless have dropped this condition earlier, if it had resulted in a loss of custom. Supporters of the code would argue that the recent change in Barclays' practice was caused by the impending improvements in the code, and that this shows the voluntary system's effectiveness. Up to a point. But it is scarcely an advertisement for the stringency of the code that Barclays was able to remain a member of the scheme while continuing this practice. Competition could have a more direct impact on basic standards if banks would devote more effort to winning each others' personal customers, in particular through developing more trouble-free ways of moving a current account. Then people angered by unexpected deductions from an account or by unwanted approaches from an insurance subsidiary would be inclined to switch to a rival bank.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Ivanov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 13 Apr -- Intergovernmental Russian-Tajik  talks ended today with the signing of two agreements -- on  Russian participation in completing the construction of the  Rogun GES [hydroelectric power station] and on a Russian loan to  Tajikistan of 80 billion rubles to be advanced during 1994. The  delegations from the two countries were headed by Prime  Ministers Viktor Chernomyrdin and Abdulmadjid Samadov.    Answering a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent, the  chairman of the Tajik Council of Ministers disclosed that  economic relations between the two countries were discussed  during the talks.    The nature of these relations is currently determined to a  great extent by the economic situation in our republic and the  need to resolve tasks involved in the unification of the Tajik  and Russian monetary systems, he said. Samadov added that the  80 billion rubles loan would be spent largely on repayment of  debts to Russian suppliers of goods.    Referring to today's announcement that the President of  Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev would not be attending the CIS  summit on 15 April in Moscow, Chernomyrdin said that he has not  yet been informed officially of this. As for Nazarbayev's idea  of creating a Euro-Asian union, Chernomyrdin believes that at  the moment there is no substance to this idea. At all events,  the prime minister said, I do not know what lies behind this  proposal.    The head of the Russian Government agreed that the leaders  of  many CIS countries were unhappy with the present state of  cooperation within the Commonwealth, which, as Chernomyrdin put  it, now needs to be intensified. We must move on to action  rather than words, he said.</p>

			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Survey of Latin American Mining (6): Bargains on offer - Peru IN PERU'S most serious sortie yet into privatisation it has put its state-owned mining companies up for sale, including Centromin, which employs some 15,000 at its seven central Andean mines and huge refinery complex as well as Minero-Peru and Hierro Peru. The government expects to have valuations by mid-November of Minero-Peru's four principal operations (the Cerro Verde copper deposits, San Antonio de Poto's goldfield, and two refineries, for zinc at Cajamarquilla and copper at Ilo). Iron monopoly Hierro Peru should be disposed of before the year ends. Investors are likely to pick up state holdings - to be split into individual production units for the purposes of sale - at bargain-basement prices. In the present uncertain economic and political climate (the de facto regime has called elections for November 22) Peru's government knows the traditional valuation process is almost meaningless. 'Prices obtained will have little to do with real asset value,' says Mr Carlos Diez Canseco, the National Mining Society's (SNM) vice-president. 'Projected cash flow will be the important factor.' He reports lively interest particularly from Canada, Chile and Australia. Geologically, Peru is the most interesting and varied country in Latin America. It ranks among the world's top seven mining countries with between 10 and 20 per cent of total copper and silver reserves and about 7 per cent of all zinc. There are also important deposits of many other sought-after minerals, with gold rapidly emerging as a leader. Minerals and metals exports bring in some Dollars 1.6bn a year in foreign exchange, equivalent last year to around 57 per cent of all export revenues. Yet it is estimated that only 12 per cent of Peru's mining potential is currently being exploited. Since the military government's nationalisation of leading foreign-owned companies in the early 1970s, the sector has suffered from desperately inadequate levels of investment in new exploration and modern technology. The only large company with a track record of sustained growth is Southern Peru Copper Corporation (SPCC), producer of two-thirds of the country's copper - it has never left US hands. For years, buoyant international minerals prices and low domestic costs masked the growing crisis in Peru's mines. But a combination of plummeting world metals prices, rocketing inflation and local interest rates, plus a heavily overvalued currency, have hammered the industry since the late 1980s. To add to producers' woes, mining - treated by Peruvian governments as a convenient cash cow - has borne a crushing fiscal burden. Indebtedness within the sector is running at record levels. But things are looking up. The SNM has recently had one success in its long-running battle with the government: as from August, the sector is enjoying some relief with the extension of a tax drawback scheme, previously available only to Peru's beleaguered silver producers, to the entire sector. 'It's the equivalent of a 10 per cent currency devaluation for miners,' comments Mr Diez Canseco., 'However, we still have to make the government see sense and exempt the sector from the selective tax on fuel.' Severe nationwide electricity shortages mean more and more mines are obliged increasingly to rely on costly petroleum. The tax reprieve came as the industry was claiming to be near total collapse. Peru's thousands of small 'artisanal' mines have all but disappeared while a quarter of the 60 or so medium-sized operations, backbone of the country's industry, have been forced either to close temporarily or to reduce personnel dramatically. The spectacle of out-of-work miners begging from passing lorries on Peru's central highway has become distressingly common. Only two mining companies ended 1991 with a positive balance sheet - in first half 1992 that increased to four, with SPCC clawing its way back from a Dollars 39m 1991 loss to a still small profit after a severe cost-cutting exercise. SPCC, at least, is demonstrating faith in Peru's future. In the wake of settlement of a long-standing dispute with the Peruvian government, the company has embarked on a Dollars 300m investment programme over the next five years. Two electro-winning plants scheduled to produce almost 40,000 tonnes a year of copper cathodes, a sulphuric acid capture plant and a package of environmental improvements add up to SPCC's largest single investment in Peru since the mid-1970s. Newmont Mining Corporation, in conjunction with Peru's old-established mining concern Buenaventura, is also putting an initial Dollars 36m into what promises to be a highly profitable gold operation at Yanacocha, northern Peru. Given the operational problems in Peru - from terrorism to political uncertainty - investments are almost certain to be joint ventures. Several medium-sized mining companies which have long-established links with foreign buyers are in talks over expansion or new investment. The regulations are attractive for those bold enough to invest in a country where two guerrilla groups still operate with relative freedom. Peru is now arguably the most liberal country in the Latin American continent in treatment of foreign capital; red-tape for foreign investors is a thing of the past and all profits and royalties can be freely remitted. Peru's notoriously rigid labour stability laws have become far more flexible and labour is still cheap by international standards. Much room for improvement remains in productivity levels, however. Principal deterrents to investment remain high security costs (equivalent to 5 per cent of sales revenue for certain mining companies, according to SNM estimates), and the still shaky macro-economic framework. But local managers expect substantial high-level interest in Centromin. 'With decent management, most of these state operations could be turned round very quickly,' says one.</p>

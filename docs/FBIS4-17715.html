			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Maynayev] </F>   [Text] Bishkek 27 April TASS -- During a one-day visit to  Bishkek, Afghan Foreign Minister Hedayat Amin Arsala discussed  with Kirgiz diplomats the situation on the Afghan-Tajik border  and development of the two countries' good-neighbourly  relations. The Afghan Foreign Ministry's head is also to visit  Tashkent on Wednesday [27 April].    The situation on the Afghan-Tajik border causes serious  concern to the Kirgizia [Kyrgystan] because its troops are among  the CIS peacekeeping forces guarding the border. Secondly,  drugs and arms are illegally transported from Gorno Badakhshan  in Tajikistan to Kirgizia. Besides, residents of Kirgizia's  southern regions are concerned over rumours about opposition  spring offensive on Badakhshan located not far from Kirgizia and  home for a lot of ethnic Kirgizians.    Officials from Kirgiz security services state that the  rumours about a forthcoming conflict in neighbouring Tajikistan  do not correspond to reality. President Askar Akayev calls on  the warring sides to begin negotiations. Nevertheless Kirgizia  is concerned over every little change in the situation in Gorno  Badakhshan.</p>

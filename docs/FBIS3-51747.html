			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Havana, 14 Jan (PL) -- Carlos Lage Davila, secretary  of the Council of Ministers Executive Committee, stated today  that Cuba has the potential to accomplish a slow economic  recovery despite the current severe limitations in resources.    Even though 1994 will be very difficult, very trying, we  trust that certain activities will improve during the year,  added Lage--who is also a member of the Communist Party of Cuba  Political Bureau--in statements to the national television news.    He said the availability of resources is directly related to  the 1992-1993 sugar harvest, when production was approximately  two million metric tons less than estimated, resulting in lost  revenues of more than $450 million.    He admitted, however, that the Cuban economy has a very slim  chance of protecting itself against the negative repercussions  resulting from external factors, such as the reinforced U.S.  economic, financial, and commercial blockade against the island.    Lage's statements were made in the central eastern Province  of Ciego de Avila, where he said the recovery of the sugar  industry constitutes an indispensable condition to surpass the  current Cuban economic crisis.</p>

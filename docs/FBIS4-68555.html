			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yegor Yakovlev: "A Handshake in Passing"] </F>   [Text] It is a line from Levitanskiy, I believe: "A year  has passed, like no time at all, we did not even have a chance  to talk..." It comes to mind over and over again specifically  today, on the day of a more than modest anniversary. It has been  one year since OBSHCHAYA GAZETA renewed its publication. To  those two issues which appeared in the days of the putsch, when  the unification of the printed word and the people which had  been growing since '85 reached its highest point, 39 more issues  have been added. They began their journey as of April of '93, in  the time of opposition and tragic discord.    All these issues were conceived to be more interesting than  they turned out. They were conceived as a dream and, like a  dream, they were not fully realized. I cannot restrain myself  from saying the most banal thing: How quickly this year has  flown! And we really did not have a chance to talk: Only an  inconsequential part of what we wanted to say when we first met  at the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA editorial office has been realized.    We began by adopting three precepts.    Not a single intelligent person shall be left  aside. The newspaper prides itself on its authors. But  their circle could have been broader. There is an abundance of  intelligent people in Russia.    To create without destroying. We strived to  analyze the current without breaking the ties of the times,  without depriving the readers of their greatest valuable--their  life experience. After all, how much can be achieved in a place  where, for the sake of a career, they are ready to divest  themselves of the past?!    To get to know ourselves and the times. And here  we were not overly successful. It still remains in question:  What kind of society are we creating, and how will each of us  live in it?    Then again, there is still plenty time to sigh about what we  did not have time to do. On the day of the anniversary, we  should speak about that which has been accomplished. The  newspaper is being published! For our times, that in itself is a  significant achievement. The editorial staff consists of people  who are devoted to the newspaper and friendly with each other.  This too is a rarity nowadays. The newspaper has a readership,  and people write to us. I can testify to the fact that, in 40  years of working on newspapers, this is the first time I have  encountered such well-prepared readers, who formulate precisely  and with ease that which concerns them.    No, we cannot brag about our circulation--alas!, nor about  the fact that we shout louder than anyone else. The most  important thing is that we have been able to foresee, to sense  the attitudes in society which have become ever more obvious in  the course of the year. We publish reflective articles to  counterweigh the political prattle which is intolerable for  people engaged in important matters. We suggest that we not  waste time waiting for ideal heroes to come to power. It is more  useful to judge about what is going on from moral positions, for  all to hear, without hiding the truth about the leading persons  and executors. In returning the name "Obshchaya" [common] to the  newspaper, we understood that the greatest deficit of our times  is the deficit of commonality with the states surrounding  Russia, and within it--commonality between people. The current  general propensity toward reunification, toward accord, which is  being raised up by the popular wave in spite of the calculations  of various politicians, confirms the fact: Here too, we were not  wrong.</p>

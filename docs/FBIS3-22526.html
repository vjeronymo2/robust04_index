It was the first time we were able to go inside an AIDS  ward and talk face to face with Egyptians who have AIDS. It was  the first time we were able to hear their voices and take their  pictures. We used to deal with them as though they were  phantoms: we heard about them, but we did not see them. We  watched them, but we kept our distance.    Now we are able to ask AIDS patients questions, and it is  now  possible for them to answer. We can take their pictures, but  from behind, due to humanitarian, family, and social  considerations. After all, society still rejects people who have  AIDS and holds them responsible for their disease even though  some AIDS patients have nothing to do with the fact that they  contracted this disease.    Here is an account of the tour from the beginning. It is a  tour of the unit where AIDS patients are treated. These  patients, out of love and compassion, share a concern about not  transmitting their disease to others that is greater than the  physicians'. Nowhere else can one see human relationships like  those we saw in that unit between the people who work in it and  their patients.    Let us start with the picture in the heart of Egypt. We are  told every year that the figures that tell us how many people  have AIDS are estimates, and we are also told that the sample is  a random sample. This then is the question, and it is also the  issue: When will we know precisely the number of Egyptians who  have AIDS?    The only center in Cairo that provides dialysis services to  patients who have kidney disease and who also have the AIDS  virus is located in al-'Abbasiyah Hummiyat Hospital. Service at  that center started in November 1990 with six machines serving  22 patients, including seven women. Three of those women and  eight men have died. The cause of death was kidney failure and  not infection with the AIDS virus.    And even this week the center, which is staffed by two  specialists, seven interns, and 12 female nurses is offering its  services to 21 patients, including six women.    [We met] two patients the moment we entered the unit. One of  them was a 53-year old farmer from Suez. That man, who is  married and is the father of six children, two of them girls,  was referred to the dialysis unit in al-'Abbasiyah by the  medical commission in Suez. Because he is the only dialysis  patient in the governorate who has the virus, it would not be  possible to designate a dialysis machine in his governorate for  his exclusive use. He endures the commute to Cairo twice a week  to undergo dialysis at the al-'Abbasiyah unit.    A decree from the Ministry of Health requires that every  governorate that has a number of patients who suffer from kidney  disease and who are HIV positive set aside a certain number of  dialysis machines for the use of those individuals. If, however,  a governorate has no more than one or two such patients, they  would be referred to the closest dialysis center treating  similar patients in another governorate.    The patient from Suez does not know how he became infected  with the AIDS virus.    The second patient was a 45-year old unemployed woman who is  the mother of two daughters and two sons. She too does not know  how she became infected. This woman who has kidney disease and  undergoes dialysis at the dialysis unit in al-'Abbasiyah,  infected her husband whose infection was discovered when samples  were taken from him and tested in one of the tests that are  conducted periodically on those who have contact with HIV  positive patients.    The female nurse who watches the dialysis machine is wearing  medical gloves. Her face is covered with a mask, and her hair is  covered with a sterilized cap. She is wearing an apron to  protect her chest, and she is also wearing disposable shoes,  which are worn only once. Anyone entering the unit has to be  wearing protective clothing similar to that which she is  wearing. Fear of AIDS, however, is not the reason for that.  Protective clothing is required for those who work with dialysis  patients to prevent contamination. These articles of clothing  are destroyed as soon as one exits the unit.    I asked the nurse, "Aren't you afraid of becoming infected?"  The immediate reply coming from the nurse who declined to  mention her name or have her picture taken was this: "The  patients are more careful than we are about not infecting us  because they are certain that if there is a single case of  infection in anyone working in the unit, everyone will stay away  and no one will have anything to do with them."    Dr. Khalid Salamah, a dialysis specialist, interjected,  "Samples are taken periodically from physicians and nurses who  have contact with the patients to ascertain that they are not  infected. The real problem does not lie in the contact we have  with the patients in the unit, but it lies with the patients  having to face other people.    "For example, the surgeon who receives a certain fee for the  permanent incision he makes in a dialysis patient asks for  thousands of pounds when he knows that the patient has AIDS.    "Also, if a patient outside the unit has to see a dentist,  he  hesitates to tell that dentist about his disease, and he waits  until he comes to us. Some of those patients will see a  physician because of persistent pain, but they don't tell that  physician about their infection. The burden then falls on  physicians who must be cautious and careful in dealing with all  patients. They must continuously sterilize all the equipment and  tools they use to protect themselves and their patients from the  possibility of infection."    We asked Dr. Qadri 'Imarah, director of al-'Abbasiyah  Hummiyat Hospital, about the procedure that would be followed  with a person who is found to have the AIDS virus. Dr. 'Imarah  said, "If infection with the virus is confirmed, the infected  person registers his name in the Health Office of his  governorate. The patient is monitored, and his condition is  checked every three months. The Communicable Diseases Section of  the Health Department offers health awareness and education  services to the patient and his family and to those who have  contact with him. The symptoms of immune deficiency disease do  not usually become evident in a person who has the virus until  some time after he is infected. And that period of time is  determined by the ability of that person's immune system to  resist infection. When that person's resistance fails, his  condition deteriorates, and it becomes incumbent upon him to go  to the Hummiyat Hospital for assistance.    "In previous years fear of infection among workers in any  hospital admitting such patients was so strong, it approached  terror. Now, however, the situation is different. As more  information about the virus became available through scientific  advances, those working with patients whose disease is advanced  have become more careful and more relaxed. This is because the  Ministry of Health has sent people abroad for training on how to  work with AIDS patients. The ministry also holds courses for  those who work in the field of communicable diseases."    Dr. 'Imarah then added, "The first case of AIDS in Egypt was  discovered in November 1986, and the patient, who was a  foreigner, was isolated in al-'Abbasiyah Hummiyat Hospital and  then deported to his country. There were also three childbirth  procedures for three women who had the virus. These were  accompanied by considerable turmoil, because physicians and  nurses were fearful about becoming infected as a result of their  involvement in those procedures.    "In the past we used to destroy everything that was used by  patients, and we used to disinfect the entire room because we  did not know for sure how the disease was transmitted. The unit  where patients were kept in isolation used to be treated as  though it were an awful place. Now, however, patients are not  kept in total isolation. They are monitored, and they are not  isolated unless their health deteriorates and they require total  supervision. In most cases patients die in the hospital."    I asked the director of al-'Abbasiyah Hummiyat Hospital  about  the patients. I asked him what kind of people they were and what  were their occupations.    He replied, "Most of them were employed abroad. Some of them  underwent surgical procedures that required blood transfusions,  and the blood they received was contaminated. The rest became  infected as a result of having multiple sexual partners and  using contaminated syringes for drug use.    "These people are sailors, pilots, and employees of travel  bureaus who have contact with groups of tourists.    "The most recent hospital death of an AIDS patient was that  of a sailboat owner who operated his sailboat on the Nile. This  man had sexual relations with female tourists."    AL-MUSAWWAR: Do you have an AIDS patient who is  being detained in the hospital at the present time?    Dr. 'Imarah said, "We have an Italian national who is in  custody pending a court case. We asked that he be isolated so  that those who have contact with him in detention do not become  exposed to infection."  <H5>  AIDS in Egypt </H5>   We leave al-'Abbasiyah Hummiyat Hospital, which is  considered  a model hospital for the treatment of AIDS patients, to explore  where else the disease can be found in Egypt.    The first AIDS case in Egypt was discovered in November  1986.  Since then the national program to fight AIDS has been operating  in conjunction with the World Health Organization [WHO]. By the  end of 1987 there were five cases of AIDS in Egypt: four were  Egyptians and one was a foreigner. Other AIDS cases were  subsequently found, and eventually the number of cases rose to  68. In 1990 some of those patients became symptomatic.    By the end of last October the total number of persons who  were found to have the AIDS virus and to have full-blown AIDS  had amounted to 313 Egyptians: 150 of them died. The number of  foreigners who were found to have the disease was 210, and they  were returned to their countries.    Dr. Muhammad Subhi 'Abd-al-Rahim, first undersecretary  minister for preventive medicine at the Ministry of Health,  said, "All the Egyptians who have the virus became infected  while they were abroad. They were infected by receiving  contaminated blood after a surgical procedure or by having sex  with a sexual partner who had the virus. There are exceptions to  this generalization. There are some singular cases like, for  example, that of the young woman from Dikirnis who unwittingly  married a man who knew he had the AIDS virus. In that case the  woman and her fetus became infected.    "There is also the al-Gharbiyah man with kidney disease who  used to undergo dialysis without knowing that he was infected  with the virus. Negligence at the center where he was receiving  the dialysis treatment was responsible for infecting 30 persons.    "Dialysis centers have been given strict instructions to  examine patients and to ascertain that they have no infectious  diseases before placing them on dialysis machines. Another basic  rule also has to do with the machine, which must be sterilized,  and as a preventive measure, the filter must be changed after  each patient so that the safety of its use can be completely  assured. Health departments check on dialysis patients every  three months to ascertain that they are free of the virus. We  are the ones who found the virus in the al-Gharbiyah patient in  the course of conducting this periodic testing on patients."    He added, "Several locations in the various governorates  have  been designated for monitoring the disease among those groups  that are most vulnerable to infection, most importantly, the  people who have venereal disease, drug addicts, prison inmates,  pregnant women, foreigners residing in Egypt, people who are  employed in the field of tourism, people who have blood  diseases, and prostitutes. By 1992 the total number of blood  samples drawn from these groups and tested came to approximately  365,577. The total number of cases found to be positive was 48."    AL-MUSAWWAR: With regard to the blood bags, is  each bag tested to ascertain that the blood in the bag is virus  free?"    Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahim said, "The ministry supplied 213 blood  banks -- these are main as well as branch offices -- with the  necessary equipment for testing blood bags for possible  contamination with the AIDS virus, hepatitis, and also syphilis.  More than 939,000 bags have been tested since 1986. In addition,  the ministry has oversight authority over all the blood banks.  And we would not think twice about shutting down any blood bank  that does not follow instructions."    AL-MUSAWWAR: How old were those Egyptians who are  carrying the virus when they became infected?    Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahim replied, "Most people who carry the AIDS  virus are between the ages of 15 and 40 years. They represent 61  percent of AIDS patients. There are eight people who have the  virus who are under 15 years old. They were being treated for  their blood diseases, and they were being given the eighth  coefficient [as published] that we used to import before 1986.  They represent 2.6 percent of the total number of AIDS cases, 81  percent of which are male, and 19 percent are female."    Dr. Subhi 'Abd-al-Rahim had this to say about the ministry's  role in protecting citizens from infection with the AIDS virus:  "We are trying to spread health awareness among all groups of  citizens. We want them to know how they might become infected so  they can avoid infection. In addition, we are monitoring the  spread of the disease, ensuring the safety of the blood supply,  and using disposable plastic syringes when immunizing people.    "Educating people about how infection is transmitted is the  most that the ministry can do. AIDS is a disease that afflicts a  healthy person who willfully fails to avoid the poor conduct  that results in his infection. AIDS is a disease that no one can  get in spite of himself."  <H5>  Foreigners </H5>   AL-MUSAWWAR: With regard to foreigners in Egypt,  how do you ascertain that they do not have AIDS?    Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahim replied, "A foreigner who comes to Egypt  [and intends] to stay for several months or longer to study or  to work is not given a work permit or a residence permit until  he has been examined and a clean bill of health is issued to him  by the central laboratories of the Ministry of Health.    "With regard to transit tourists, however, no one has the  right to examine them to ascertain that they are free of the  virus. Their temporary residence does not pose a threat because  the disease can only be transmitted through blood or sexual  intercourse."    In order to have the full picture about AIDS, one would  naturally take a look at what is happening with AIDS in the  world around us and also in the East Mediterranean, the area set  off by the WHO.    The WHO estimates that more than 10 million adults and  children worldwide have been infected with the AIDS virus since  it was first discovered. Approximately two million persons are  now in an advanced stage of the disease, which starts, on the  average, 10 years after a person is infected with the virus for  the first time.    The organization estimates that the total number of men,  women, and children infected with the AIDS virus by the year  2000 will be between 30 and 40 million persons. Between 12 and  18 million persons will have full-blown AIDS by then, and  approximately 90 percent of the people who are expected to  become infected with the AIDS virus during this decade will be  in developing countries.    The WHO expects developing countries to suffer more from the  spread of this disease because the supreme political authorities  in those countries do not provide adequate support for the  efforts that are necessary to prevent this disease and to fight  against it.    There are also other fundamental obstacles to the effective  prevention of this disease. There is, for example, ignorance  about the nature of the disease, and there is denial that a  relationship exists between AIDS, on the one hand, and an  individual or society, on the other. Another obstacle is the  failure to deal seriously with the disease or the inability to  do something about its enormously catastrophic nature. Other  obstacles include the low social and economic status of women,  the traditional and cultural practices that make transmittal of  the disease easier, and the avoidance of informed and frank  discussions about sexual matters.    Dr. Muhammad Hilmi Wahdan, director of prevention at WHO's  East Mediterranean regional office, said, "Incontrovertible  evidence has proved that the AIDS virus is transmitted basically  through the vehicle of individual conduct. In some societies  risky factors and practices are widespread, quite openly. People  do not think twice about engaging in such practices, and they do  very little to prevent them. In such cases society has to play a  significant role, and it has to intervene if it really wants to  protect individuals' health as well as public health from an  AIDS invasion. In other societies where risky factors and  practices are rejected outright by society, these factors and  practices take place in secret, and governments cannot do much  to affect them. It is in those instances that the role of  society becomes important: to confront what is being done in  secret and to discuss it candidly and unequivocally.  <H5>  The Features of the Epidemic </H5>   The WHO identifies the features of the AIDS epidemic in the  East Mediterranean region. The most important of them are:     -  Infection came into the region late. At first people  became infected by imported blood or as a result of sexual  intercourse with persons from areas where the virus was  widespread.    -  Prostitution is illegal [in the region], but it is secretly  practiced even though the extent to which it is being practiced  is not known.    -  The extent to which drugs are administered by injection is  not  known, but the problem is not a simple one.    -  These countries attach significant importance to the ethical  values that are imposed by religion and society.       By September 1992 the total number of cases reported [to the  WHO] from 20 countries in the East Mediterranean region had  amounted to 1,399. In addition, there were 308 cases of  illnesses that occur with AIDS and are associated with it, and  there were 4,641 cases of people who had been infected with the  AIDS virus but who had not shown symptoms of the disease.    It is estimated, however, that the real number of cases  exceeds these figures, because in many countries diagnosis  remains inadequate and cases are under-reported. The East  Mediterranean region is an area that extends from the Maghreb  [to the west of that region] all the way to Afghanistan in the  east.    Seventy-five percent of those who have AIDS are male, and 25  percent are female. The age group that has the highest number of  reported cases is that group that is between the ages of 30 and  39. Those between the ages of 20 and 29 are the group with the  second highest number of reported cases. That is followed by the  group that is made up of those between the ages of 15 and 19.  Almost nine-tenths of the cases occurred among those who are  between 15 and 39 years old.    Sexual intercourse is the leading way of transmitting the  virus. It is the cause of infection in about 77 percent of  reported cases. Whereas heterosexual sex, which is the prevalent  form of sex, accounted for 69 percent of those cases, it was  also noticed that homosexual relationships accounted for eight  percent of the sexually transmitted cases of the disease. Blood  transfusions and blood products accounted for 15 percent of the  cases; intravenous drug use accounted for six percent; and  finally, two percent of AIDS cases became infected during  childbirth.  <H5>  Sex Education </H5>   If these are the most important characteristics of how AIDS  was spread worldwide and in the East Mediterranean region, what  might be the true picture of how the disease was spread in  Egypt, which is located in the heart of the Middle East? Do we  have a civilized, scientific approach for dealing with this  danger that is coming our way? Is our approach based on  confronting the facts and acting on the basis of those facts, or  are we burying our heads in the sand in an attempt to escape and  delay the danger?    WHO figures indicate that sexual activity is one of the  leading causes of infection with the AIDS virus in the East  Mediterranean region. It is the cause of infection in 77 percent  of all cases. People who are uptight will undoubtedly speak up  here and declare that homosexual activity, which is the main  cause of infection, is prohibited by our religion.  Unfortunately, however, sexual activity among homosexuals  accounts for no more than eight percent of the cases of  infection, whereas normal sexual activity accounts for 69  percent of all cases of infection with the disease.    It is that which is making sexual conduct the focus of  direct  attention. That is where the emphasis must be placed to stop the  infection with the disease. This can be done by devoting  attention to the fact that all young people have to be educated.  A scientific program to teach sex [in school] during the  preparatory stage of education has to be devised. Sex is to be  taught in a simple manner that would be compatible with the  students' ability to absorb and understand. The religious and  spiritual sides of these young people is also to be nurtured. In  addition, emphasis must be placed on men and women abstaining  from illegitimate sexual relationships that would expose both  husbands and wives to the risk of infection.    The responsibility of implementing this role does not rest  solely on the shoulders of the Ministry of Health. It rather  falls on everybody's shoulders: physicians, people in the media,  teachers, scientists, and clergymen. Everyone in society has to  take part in an informed, educational campaign that would be  based on clarity, candor, and disclosure of the facts. This is  especially important given the fact that the man who is  responsible for the health of all Egyptians proclaims the notion  that the credibility of any official is determined by that  official's knowledge of the truth and [the extent to which] he  proclaims it.    Dr. 'Ali 'Abd-al-Fattah, the minister of health said, "It  has  been proved that the AIDS virus is spreading. People have to be  made aware of the need for abstinence and the need to adhere to  proper, moral conduct so that disease can be avoided. We have to  call attention to the fact that there are AIDS cases in Egypt.  At the same time, we have to give people adequate instructions  so they can avoid infection. It is up to each AIDS patient to  fear God and to tell his physicians about his disease so as not  to infect others."</p>

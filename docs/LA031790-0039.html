			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP BASKETBALL STATE CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> MATER DEI VS. RIORDAN  </P> <P> RECORDS -- Mater Dei (33-1), Riordan (29-2)  </P> <P> SITE -- Oakland Coliseum Arena, 7 p.m.  </P> <P> MATER DEI UPDATE -- A last-second three-point basket by guard Jason Quinn gave  Mater Dei a 46-45 victory over Long Beach Poly in the regional championship  last Saturday. It was the Monarchs' 25th consecutive victory and put them in  their second state title game. Mater Dei won the 1987 state title behind the  play of center LeRon Ellis. This year's team features a balanced attack with  five players averaging between nine and 15.8 points per game. Guard David Boyle  is the team's leading scorer, but forward Charlie Andres has been the  difference in the playoffs. Andres is averaging 12 points and 12 rebounds per  game in eight postseason games. Coach Gary McKnight, who has compiled a 226-19  record in eight years, has missed practice this week after suffering severe  muscle spasms in his back, but said he will be in Oakland.  </P> <P> RIORDAN UPDATE -- A solid defense and the one-two scoring punch of forward  Dwayne Fontana and guard Dorian Manigo have carried Riordan to its first state  title appearance. Riordan allowed an average of only 55.6 points per game in  three regional games. Riordan has won 11 consecutive games. Its only losses  this season were to Los Angeles Fremont, 76-73, in the Amador Valley tournament  and to Archbishop Mitty, 69-66, in a West Catholic Athletic League game.  Fontana, who has signed with Arizona State, is the team's best player. He  averages 22 points and 12 rebounds per game. Manigo, who has signed with Cal  State Northridge, averages 19.1 points and four rebounds.  </P> <P> KEY TO THE GAME -- Mater Dei must avoid the false security that some previous  Southern California Regional winners have taken to Oakland. Granted, Southern  Regional winners have won eight consecutive state titles, but Northern teams  traditionally play inspired games in front of partisan crowds. Riordan's key  players, Fontana and Manigo, must avoid foul trouble.  </P> <P> CONSENSUS -- Mater Dei isn't planning to leave the Bay Area until Monday night.  Could this mean a long victory celebration has been planned? Why not? Mater Dei  has too much height and depth for a two-man team like Riordan's, but the game  will be closer than most expect. Mater Dei by six.  </P></p>

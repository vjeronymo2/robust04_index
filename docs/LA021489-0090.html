			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTH DEFENSE ASSAILS DEAL ON SECRET DATA;  </P> <P> SAYS IT WOULD HIDE CRITICAL INFORMATION ON THIRD-COUNTRY AID  </P> <P> Lt. Col. Oliver L. North's lawyers Monday objected to a proposed compromise on  releasing classified information at his Iran-Contra trial, saying that the plan  worked out by independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh and the Justice Department  "would gut the defense and guarantee a 'cuckoo-clock' trial."  </P> <P> North attorney Brendan V. Sullivan Jr. said that the deal worked out over the  weekend would hide "critical information about the Reagan Administration's  third-country arrangements for military support of the (Nicaraguan) resistance  and the official non-disclosure of those arrangements."  </P> <P> With the trial of the former White House aide apparently delayed for at least  several more days, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell temporarily dismissed  jurors and planned to hear legal arguments by all sides today before deciding  whether to adopt the proposed compromise and resume North's trial on 12 felony  charges.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Opening Statement  </P> <P> North's lawyers said that they want the court's approval to tell jurors in  their opening statement that former President Ronald Reagan and top officials  of his Administration obtained aid from third countries to help rearm the  Contras but planned to conceal the operation from Congress and the public.  </P> <P> The compromise worked out between Justice Department lawyers and Walsh would  ask Gesell to impose more stringent restrictions on what North's lawyers may  disclose in court. Details of the compromise, however, remain under seal.  </P> <P> The weekend agreement diffused a bitter confrontation between Atty. Gen. Dick  Thornburgh, who wanted Gesell to prohibit a specific list of disclosures, and  the independent prosecutors, who expressed satisfaction with Gesell's existing  orders, which define broad categories of what may and may not be disclosed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Temporary Stay  </P> <P> If Gesell accepts the compromise, the Justice Department said that it would ask  Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist to dissolve a temporary stay of North's  trial, which he imposed Sunday until the Supreme Court could consider the issue  on Friday.  </P> <P> However, in court papers that Gesell unsealed Monday, North's lawyers objected  to any additional restrictions and called on the judge to hold fast to his  earlier orders. They said, for example, that disclosure to jurors of U.S.  efforts to obtain third-country military aid for the Contras -- to which  government security analysts apparently have objected -- is "critical" to  North's defense.  </P> <P> Defense attorneys Sullivan and Barry S. Simon complained that the government  has offered an inadequate stipulation of facts on this issue in an effort to  have specific details squelched under terms of the Classified Information  Procedures Act.  </P> <P> "The stipulation omits critical details of those third-country arrangements,  and it fails to acknowledge that President Reagan and other top Administration  officials established a policy that the arrangements would not be disclosed  outside the executive branch," the defense motion said.  </P> <P> Such stipulations, Sullivan said, "would guarantee a 'cuckoo-clock' trial that  would make a mockery of the adversarial process."  </P> <P> Gesell has said that he is opposed to a "cuckoo-clock trial," a phrase he has  used to describe constant objections by government intelligence experts to  disclosure of state secrets.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Closed Session  </P> <P> North's lawyers quoted Gesell as having said in a transcript of a closed  session earlier this month that the third-country plan exemplified "the area of  concealment, as I understand it, that is an issue in this case." They quoted  the judge as saying further that North "should be entitled to have the jury see  the circumstances under which he acted."  </P> <P> The defense lawyers said that third-country military aid for the Contras was  arranged at a time when Congress had forbidden the executive branch from  providing military assistance to the rebels. The plan operated on a quid pro  quo basis, meaning that the United States pledged to help the third countries  in return, they said.  </P> <P> Besides Reagan, others who "participated personally and directly" in this  policy included former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, former Defense  Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, former National Security Adviser Robert C.  McFarlane and the late William J. Casey, director of the CIA, the defense  papers said.  </P> <P> Congressional hearings into the Iran-Contra scandal two years ago disclosed  that Brunei, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan and at least 10 other unnamed countries  provided Contra aid under this policy. But $10 million from the Sultan of  Brunei mistakenly wound up in the wrong Swiss bank account.  </P> <P> Gesell, in temporarily excusing jurors Monday morning, instructed them to phone  him each afternoon to see if they might be needed the following morning. But he  said that "it's not in the court's hands," a reference to the temporary stay  that has been imposed by Rehnquist.  </P> <P> In a related development, ranking members of the Senate Intelligence Committee  said that they have asked Thornburgh and CIA Director William H. Webster to  testify about the classified documents issue in a closed session on Feb. 21.  </P> <P> The committee said that it expects to focus on Thornburgh's certification last  month that sensitive material could not be provided to try North on the central  charges of conspiracy and theft. As a result of Thornburgh's determination,  those charges subsequently were dropped, leaving North to be tried on 12 lesser  felony charges, including obstruction of congressional and presidential  inquiries and making false statements to Congress.  </P></p>

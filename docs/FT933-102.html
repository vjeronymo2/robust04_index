			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / International Company News: GM forced to revise output estimates GENERAL Motors, which has been involved in a shake-up of its supplier network over the past 18 months, said third-quarter US production would be 70,000 vehicles below earlier estimates, writes Martin Dickson. It blamed problems with fitting new parts into its models. The company estimated in July that production of cars and trucks would total 845,000 units in the quarter. This is now expected to be 775,000. Analysts said the shortfall could hit its third-quarter financial results, and make it harder to achieve its goal of breaking even in North America this year on an operating basis, after several years of heavy losses.</p>

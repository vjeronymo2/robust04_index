			<p>BFN     [Text] AL-KHABAR and AL-WATAN newspapers today published an  article by the head of the government [Redha Malek] in which he  gave an analysis of the situation that our country is  experiencing on all levels. Jamila Mezoued has the details.    [Begin Mezoued recording] Mr. Redha Malek said state  officials, both civilian and military, have continued with  courage and bravery to carry out their difficult tasks to  repulse the specter of disorder and establish law and order.  The head of the government added that recently some new  promising economic prospects have started to become clear  because of the agreements that are about to be signed with the  International Monetary Fund.    Mr. Redha Malek said all these compact acts constitute a  firm  view by a government that has not lost the initiative; it is  today required, in the name of the public interest, to leave its  distinctive marks on the course of events.    The head of the government said political pluralism and the  freedom of expression are some of the main gains Algerian people  have obtained since the ratification of the 1982 constitution.  The government will remain, more than any time before, eager to  preserve and bolster these gains.    Mr. Redha Malek added that in this sphere, it was high time  for the restitution of the rule of law, because when some  leaders of some political groups expect to achieve political  interest by turning a blind eye on the terror that is shaking up  a whole society, then this is ethically unacceptable, but it  remains that everybody should have a conscience and, and history  will be his judge.    In his article Mr. Redha Malek also says that when some  openly call for insubordination and rebellion inside  institutions dealing with order, and for an international  boycott of our country, they are then obviously dealt with in  accordance with the laws of the republic. Only the state bears  the task of defending property and persons, preserving the unity  of the people, and guaranteeing the harmony of the nation  throughout the homeland. It is fine, Mr. Redha Malek says, that  we denounce bribery, favoritism, nepotism, and all scourges.  This is a salvation and courageous action, a commitment to  society for the emerging of a political culture devoid of  illegitimate privileges and settlement of accounts. The tactics  of securing gains and all the demagogic ways that have been used  excessively by some people must be fought by the political class  first if the latter wants to retrieve its credibility.    Concerning the role of the press, Mr. Redha Malek says in  his  article that the information media play a decisive role,  sometimes negative and sometimes positive, in changing  situations. But some journalists and papers, the prime minister  adds, have not yet arrived at appreciating the exceptional  situation we are going through, and the degree of the  complication and danger of the situation in our country.    Mr. Redha Malek said that in my capacity as the head of the  executive body, the laws of the republic will be implemented on  everybody. The prime minister added that if there were  criticisms on this issue, they should be put in a clear and  detailed way. The destructive confusion of issues and the easy  and unfounded accusations should disappear completely from the  columns of our press.    The article of Mr. Redha Malek added that the appointment of  Liamine Zeroual as head of state will strongly contribute  towards the definition of the vision and the consolidation of  stability and security. If combating terrorism remains the most  pressing duty of the state, it will not neglect other essential  duties represented in the renewal of our political system to  enable it to manage the transitional phase, in the light of a  critical change, as stated by Liamine Zeroual in his speech in  Tunisia. Mr. Redha Malek added that today, more than in any  other times, our country strongly needs its sons. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ASK DR. RUTH: FRENCHMEN HAVE NO SPECIAL SKILL AT ART OF LOVEMAKING  </P> <P> Question: Is there any truth in the idea that certain ethnic groups are better  lovers than others? If so, who's best?  </P> <P> Answer: It is one of our most cherished ideas that French and Latin people do  love and sex better than we do, whoever we are. I like the French legend best  because I love Paris. Even though I lived hard years there in my youth, it is  the city of love as well as of light.  </P> <P> But in any good French novel that represents life faithfully, you will find  sexual unhappiness. Furthermore, I have no evidence that Frenchmen are  universally more devoted to pleasing the woman sexually than males of other  nationalities. So I can honestly say, not just to encourage people of every  ethnic origin but because evidence backs it up, anyone can become a splendid  lover who wants to do so. I don't mean a stud or top geisha, or an always-ready  cavalier, a sex machine, but a wonderful and desired lover to someone.  </P> <P> Q: I thought everything was fine between us until three weeks ago. At that  point my husband of 11 years told me he still cares for me but is not in love  with me. He would rather be by himself than with me. He agrees to see a  marriage counselor before talking divorce.  </P> <P> A: If he says that, it may mean he would like to be talked back into liking  your company, or to get into a dialogue that could lead to agreements between  you. Maybe it means that, maybe not. Maybe it means he wants to get away from  you but doesn't want to feel excessively guilty about hurting you. Maybe he  thinks the counselor will help you adjust to the idea of divorce. As marriage  counselor I have had that task of helping both partners to agree to divorce  when keeping the marriage was hopeless. Not all marriages are viable.  </P> <P> I only want to add this: Generally married people who stay together on good  terms fall in and out of love with each other at times. Being in love is  something more heightened and emotional than getting along with or liking or  approving. It is more exciting than pure contentment -- and let me say, pure  contentment is OK, even better than OK! But being in love is thinking of the  other when separated and feeling a lift in the heart, an excitement at the idea  of meeting again even if the separation has been only a few hours.  </P> <P> So if your husband has fallen out of love, that doesn't necessarily mean he  can't fall back in love, and with you. When you do go to the counselor, don't  expect magic, but maybe there is a way to get back together with understanding  on both sides.  </P></p>

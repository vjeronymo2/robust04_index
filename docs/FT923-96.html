			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Squeeze on margins hits T&amp;S T&amp;S STORES has attributed a fall in pre-tax profits to a squeeze on margins at Supercigs, its tobacco retailing subsidiary, and Dillons, its chain of newsagents. In the first half of 1992 pre-tax profits fell nearly 8 per cent, from Pounds 7.08m to Pounds 6.54m, in spite of a 9 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 166.1m. Cigarette volumes were affected by another increase in duty but sales of newspapers and confectionery held up well. Neighbourhood and convenience store retailing fared better than Supercigs, which continued to suffer from fewer customers on the high streets. Mr Kevin Threlfall, chairman and chief executive, said: 'We have to do something about reduced consumer demand, rather than blaming it.' The growing chain of Dillons convenience stores, currently at 94, lifted turnover 33 per cent to Pounds 32.1m and trading profits 41 per cent to Pounds 1.99m. Although turnover from the 212 Supercigs outlets rose 5 per cent to Pounds 83.92m, trading profit dropped 9 per cent to Pounds 2.04m. The group maintained its 3 per cent share of the national cigarette market, which had fallen by about 8 per cent overall. The Dillons chain of 283 newsagents lifted turnover by 4.5 per cent to Pounds 50.1m but saw trading profits dip 2.5 per cent to Pounds 2.55m. Although the group's overall trading profits rose 5 per cent to Pounds 6.57m, the pre-tax figure was reduced by an interest payment of Pounds 50,000, which compared with interest receivable of Pounds 200,000 last time. T&amp;S said the air of uncertainty in the property market had restricted the sale and purchase of businesses, and profits from disposals fell from Pounds 623,000 to Pounds 222,000. A reduction in shop stock coupled with tight warehouse controls reversed the year-end cash position from an overdraft of Pounds 15m to cash of Pounds 5m. Earnings per share rose to 7.69p (7.57p), while the interim dividend is lifted to 2.4p (2.25p). COMMENT Mr Threlfall has stripped out more than Pounds 1m of annualised costs by slimming the management structure, closing four regional offices and making more use of information technology, although the benefit will be felt more next year. Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 13m put the shares, down 5p to 181p yesterday, on a prospective multiple of about 12. That seems undemanding, given the quality of the management and success of its news-based convenience store formula. The group perhaps suffers from being associated so strongly with tobacco, but the contribution from cigarettes is set to diminish. The share price may also be overhung by concerns about another big acquisition, following its Pounds 53.9m purchase of the Dillons and Preedy chains from Next, which required a rights issue in 1989. T&amp;S might well be interested in a convenience store chain, with a warehouse and distribution network in the south, but said the rights issue required for such a deal would probably be closer to 20 per cent of the group's size.</p>

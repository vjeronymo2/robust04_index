			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Bartels to quit as chief of Foster's: Boardroom wrangles continue at Australian brewer FOSTER'S Brewing Group, formerly Elders IXL, is expected to announce today that Mr Peter Bartels, chief executive, has resigned following boardroom wrangling over strategy. He is expected to be replaced by Mr Ted Kunkel, chief executive of Molson Breweries, the Canadian brewing group, which is half-owned by Foster's. However, this was not confirmed. Mr Bartels' departure comes four months after he survived a boardroom coup by Mr John Elliott, Foster's former chairman and chief executive, now non-executive deputy chairman. Mr Elliott tried to recover management control of the company through his private company, International Brewing Holdings, which owns 38 per cent of Foster's. A public row was avoided by a compromise worked out between Mr Elliott and Mr Nobby Clark, Foster's chairman, with the assistance of Asahi Breweries, the Japanese company which owns 20 per cent of Foster's. Rumours persisted that Mr Elliott was unhappy with the strategy being pursued by Mr Bartels, who was appointed in a management shake-up which followed Foster's record loss of ADollars 1.3bn (Pounds 573m) in 1989-90. Mr Bartels, backed by Mr Clark, resisted pressure from Mr Elliott for sales of non-brewing assets to help finance a return to dividend payments, suspended in 1990 following a net loss of ADollars 43m. Mr Elliott sought a capital return to shareholders as part of his efforts to repay debts of ADollars 2.5bn acquired by IBH to finance its shareholding in Foster's. The shares are worth about ADollars 1.65bn at last night's closing price of ADollars 1.92 in Sydney. Mr Bartels' resignation is believed to have been prompted by the board's decision to pay an interim dividend for the six months to December, when the group made a net profit of ADollars 77m. Mr Bartels argued for a further delay in resuming dividend payments to strengthen the group's balance sheet. However, the dividend was forced through after the two Asahi directors voted with Mr Elliott.</p>

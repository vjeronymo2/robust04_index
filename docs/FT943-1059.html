			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / World Bond Markets: Volatility puts fundraising on hold - International Abbey National, the UK home loans and banking group, last week became the latest casualty of this year's sharp fall in world bond markets when it was forced to postpone its proposed global bond offering due to 'terrible market conditions'. The postponement raises an obvious question: How badly has the extreme volatility in the bond markets this year affected borrowers' funding programmes? Many borrowers have simply had to swallow hard and pay the high price of borrowing in a bear market. Ever since the first rise in US short-term interest rates in February, investors have been jittery about the prospects of rising inflation and higher interest rates worldwide. Long bond yields in the UK, for example, have risen from 6.3 per cent in January to around 9 per cent. Other borrowers, however, managed to complete most of their fundraising in the first part of this year before yields reached their current dizzy heights. Abbey National, for example, has already raised Dollars 8bn so far this year. 'A lot of funding was done in the first few months of the year. With interest rates at historically low levels, many borrowers were eager to get as much under their belt as possible,' said one syndicate manager. Other examples include the Province of Ontario, one of the world's biggest non-sovereign borrowers, which is now 88 per cent of the way through its CDollars 11.4bn borrowing programme for this year. Similarly, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has already managed to raise 80 per cent of its Ecu1bn borrowing programme for 1994. These borrowers can now perhaps afford to wait until conditions improve before they have to tap the bond markets for any substantial amount again. 'We now have the ability to wait out the bad times. This year we were lucky enough to anticipate some of the volatility,' said Mr Louis de Montpellier, the EBRD's director of funding. Other borrowers, particularly in the corporate sector, have simply not needed to tap the bond markets this year, for two main reasons. First, many companies have been keen to cut back on the amount of debt they hold, in part to reduce their exposure to rising interest rates. As a result, they have borrowed less. Second, they have been able to find relatively cheap alternative sources of finance. Put off by the high yields on long-term fixed-rate debt, they have turned to short-term, private, highly structured means of borrowing, such as the floating-rate note and syndicated loans market, both of which have seen an explosion of activity this year. 'There is no doubt that most borrowing has been hampered this year, but what has been bearish for one market has been bullish for another,' said one dealer. Floating-rate notes are a type of short-term debt offering a relatively low variable rate of interest which moves to reflect changes in money market interest rates. They therefore represent an obvious refuge for investors in a rising interest rate environment. As a result, as US interest rates headed upwards in the first few months of this year, and as the fixed-rate bond market began to slow, there was a flood of new FRN issues. Borrowers launched an equivalent of Dollars 34.1bn in FRNs in the first three months of 1994, compared with a total of Dollars 17.1bn in the first quarter of 1993. The syndicated loans market has provided companies with an extremely cheap source of finance in the second half of this year. Having repaired the damage done to their balance sheets by the bad debts of the late 1980s, and with loans granted at the end of the last decade now close to maturity, many banks have become very eager to begin lending again - and have turned aggressively to syndicated loans. 'Banks are awash with capital and are hungry for new assets,' said one syndicate manager in London. Competition among banks for new business has driven the cost of loans down to remarkably low levels. Over the last year, the spread over Libor on a syndicated loan to a typical European corporate borrower, with a Single A credit rating, has dropped from about 45 basis points to around 20 to 22 basis points. Last month, Spain borrowed Ecu6bn over five years at a spread of just 4 1/2 basis points over Libor. 'Spain would not have been able to borrow such a large amount and at such a low cost in the bond market,' said one syndicate manager. This does not mean, however, that volatile conditions in bond markets have become irrelevant. Many countries, particularly high yielding European nations which were badly affected by this year's turbulence, still have large funding programmes to complete. They will be returning to the bond markets before the end of the year whether conditions have improved or not. Other borrowers may wait for better conditions to prevail but this may prove to be a very dangerous game to play. 'There is little chance that bond market conditions are going to improve with a lot of supply still to come into the market and with European interest rates heading upwards,' said one trader. High yields may hurt but if the prospect is for them to move higher still, it may be better to brave current conditions sooner rather than later.</p>

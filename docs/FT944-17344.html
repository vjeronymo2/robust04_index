			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Conglomerates Conglomerates have become extremely unfashionable. The diversified industrial sector - dominated by Hanson and BTR - has underperformed sharply in the latest market downturn. The worst under-performance followed the margin squeeze displayed in BTR's half-year figures last month, but there is general perception that the sector has gone irredeemably ex-growth. BTR and Hanson are too big to do deals substantial enough to generate the superior earnings growth of the past. The Accounting Standard Board has stamped out opportunities for boosting post-acquisition profits through fair value adjustments and other ruses. Conglomerates are suffering in today's low-inflation environment, unable to force up prices when the cost of raw materials is rising. It is unfair to tar all companies with the same brush. Hanson's problems are not identical to those of BTR; its exposure to coal, timber and chemicals makes it more dependent on commodities prices. Tomkins and Williams Holdings have redefined what it means to be a conglomerate; Williams' new focus has earned it a premium rating stripped from Tomkins after its opportunistic acquisition of Ranks Hovis McDougall. Wassall's high rating demonstrates that acquisitive conglomerates can still win City favour, if they can find earnings-enhancing acquisitions. But Hanson and BTR must rely for their chief attraction on above average yields.</p>

			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Italy's bank chief calls for urgent action on economy MR Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the governor of the Bank of Italy, called over the weekend for the urgent introduction of an austerity package to tackle the country's fast deteriorating public finances. Ineffective economic policy in 1991 and in the current year had left Italy little time to put in place the necessary measures to permit the economy to reach the targets for convergence with the EC laid down by the Maastricht summit, he said. 'The imbalances risk getting worse; they could preclude us from the path of Maastricht and could well undermine the (country's) long-term productive potential,' he said in his statement accompanying the presentation of the bank's annual report. He also warned: 'It could fall to us the grave responsibility of being the ones who become an obstacle to the construction of Europe.' This was Mr Ciampi's gloomiest annual statement since he took office more than a decade ago. Coming as politicians begin consultations on the formation of a new government this week, his comments were seen as offering a technician's economic agenda. Mr Ciampi himself is being canvassed by some in parliament as the possible head of a new 'super ministry' of the economy, combining the current three portfolios. The next government, he said, had to act on four fronts - foreign exchange and monetary policy; competition; incomes and prices; and public finances. He was adamant on the need to maintain a strong lira within the narrow band of the European exchange rate mechanism. Money supply had to be tightly controlled, limiting the expansion of M2 to a band between 5 and 7 per cent. Already money supply has edged above this upper limit. On competition, he urged greater liberalisation of the services sector where cartels and restrictive practices were a major contributor to inflation. The third component of the measures, he said, should be a fairly agreed incomes policy. However he warned that incomes could not rise above inflation levels and, if anything, risked declining in real terms. The main sacrifices and attention, however, had to be directed towards Italy's public finances. Already this year the budget is projected to have a deficit of L165,000bn (Pounds 74.8bn) instead of L128,000bn. Measures had to be adopted to reduce by the second half of this year the percentage of the public sector's deficit weight on the GDP by two percentage points. A further reduction of two percentage points was essential in 1993. Only in this way could the present deficit, equivalent to 10.5 per cent of GDP, move towards the EC target. He concluded by saying: 'It is unacceptable when a society knows full well the nature of its problems, which knows how they should be resolved . . . is incapable of translating this into action.'</p>

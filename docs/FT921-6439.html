			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Observer: Public affairs Graham Mather, general director of the Institute of Economic Affairs, has found a novel way of rebuffing those who accuse him of getting too cosy with the Tory party. He will today host a joint seminar at the Cafe Royal with Demos, a new left-leaning think-tank, on the future relationship between the public and private sectors. Demos, to be formally launched in the autumn, unites a diverse group of movers and shakers who say they are fed up with the narrow limits of traditional political debate. The event, which is fully booked, has certainly attracted a wide range of speakers. The gathering includes Sir Len Peach, director of personnel at IBM, Marianne Neville Rolfe, chief executive of the Civil Service College, Sir Peter Kemp, architect of the Whitehall Next Steps initiative, Sir Alastair Morton, chief executive of Eurotunnel and Elizabeth Symons, high-flying general secretary of the FDA, the top civil servants' union. Still, political demarcation lines have yet to erode sufficiently to allow talk of a merger between the two tanks to creep onto the agenda.</p>

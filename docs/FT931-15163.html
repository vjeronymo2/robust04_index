			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Observer: Rescheduling Bob Phillis and Liz Forgan haven't even arrived at the BBC yet, but that has not stopped their futures being mapped out. Phillis, the 47-year-old ITN boss, who takes over as deputy director-general, is only one year younger than John Birt, the new director-general. But he is already being seen as Birt's natural successor. The precedents are already well established. The last two deputy DGs, Birt and Sir Michael Checkland, went on to get the top job. Liz Forgan, 48, who comes from Channel 4 to be managing director of BBC Radio, would - after a spell in BBC Television - be well placed to become the first woman to make it to deputy DG. Such changes may not be as far away as some appear to suspect. John Birt is unlikely to stay longer than his five-year term. Once the place is restructured and the BBC's Royal Charter is renewed in 1996, Big Brother Birt will want to be off in search of new conquests.</p>

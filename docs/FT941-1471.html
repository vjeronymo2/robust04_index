			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Caribbean Basin nations on course for trade bloc Representatives of 22 countries and several dependent territories in the Caribbean Basin have concluded the first round of talks aimed at creating a new regional trade group. The Association of Caribbean States - its provisional title - will start as a consultative group linking up to 25 countries as full members and 15 dependent territories as associate members. It could eventually become the world's fourth largest trade bloc. The draft convention, discussed in Kingston, will be studied further at a meeting in the Dominican Republic in May, before being taken up by ministers in June. Members will sign the agreement in July. Prospective members of the ACS include Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela, Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, the Central American states, Surinam and members of the Caribbean Community. According to the draft convention, the group's main objectives will be liberalising trade and investment; co-ordinating negotiating positions on bilateral and multilateral issues; and promoting investment opportunities in the Caribbean Basin. 'We are creating an environment and it is the beginning of the process,' said Mr Edwin Carrington, secretary general of the Caribbean Community (Caricom), which is co-ordinating the formation of the ACS. But the 25 countries which had sent representatives to the meetings had the potential to create the world's fourth biggest trade bloc. The likely membership of the ACS has a combined population of 200m people, an estimated gross national product of Dollars 500bn (Pounds 342bn), estimated annual merchandise exports of Dollars 80bn, and annual merchandise imports of Dollars 100bn. There is already some uncertainty over how Cuba will fit into the group. Some delegates to the Kingston conference said they expected, but would not be deterred by, US irritation at Cuba's participation, although this could worry other potential members. Two US Caribbean possessions - Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands - are unlikely to be interested in the group because of Cuba's participation.</p>

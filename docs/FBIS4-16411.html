			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by diplomatic </F> correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others]    [Text] Georgia's Foreign Minister Aleksandre Chikvaidze  told Interfax there was hope for certain progress in the moves  to settle the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict now that agreement had  been reached on the repatriation of refugees.    Chikvaidze said it was slow progress even though nothing had  been lost and hope remained for breaking the logjam in  Georgian-Abkhazian relations.    Chikvaidze said Georgia and other countries could share many  thoughts on the draft convention on the rights of ethnic  minorities. Expert teams would have to work much before the  convention could be signed, he said. On Thursday the  Commonwealth's Council of Foreign Ministers decided the document  was not yet ready for signing.    Chikvaidze stressed that Georgia wanted more integration  with  the Commonwealth of Independent States and would be working to  achieve this. Integration was essential primarily from the  point of view of economics. Georgia would try to keep its  policies for Russia and other Commonwealth republics balanced  with a view to promote good relations between the Georgians and  Russians and other peoples.    Chikvaidze felt economic cooperation between Georgia and  Russia would expand. Expanded cooperation and subsequent  economic growth could well lead to the exchange of Georgian  coupons for Russian rubles, said Chikvaidze and cited the  example of Belarus.</p>

			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> LAWYERS' PAY TALKS SEE LITTLE PROGRESS  </P> <P> Both sides in a labor dispute between county administrators and 300 county  lawyers say they want to avoid a strike -- and the chaos it could bring to  already jammed courts.  </P> <P> But by the end of last week, there was little hint of progress in salary talks  for deputy prosecutors, public defenders and county counsel, whose contract  expired at 5 p.m. Friday.  </P> <P> On Thursday night, the lawyers' association rejected the last offer, 255 to 0.  </P> <P> For the first time since the Orange County Attorneys Assn. staged a sickout 11  years ago, county lawyers are working without a contract.  </P> <P> While both sides deny animosity, there is a growing note of bitterness in their  public comments.  </P> <P> "Since I first became a city council member and in my time on the board . . . I  have never seen a less professional organization to deal with," Supervisor  Roger R. Stanton angrily said about the lawyers' group.  </P> <P> At the center of the debate is the association's contention that the county's  pay for its its legal staff is producing an exodus of experience and talent  that has reached crisis proportions. In the last two years, according to  figures compiled by the association, 100 of the 300 lawyers employed by the  county have left, in most cases for higher-paying jobs in other counties or in  the private sector as defense lawyers.  </P> <P> The Orange County district attorney's office has lost 51 of its 143 deputies,  according to the association's statistics.  </P> <P> "We feel it is more effective to have an office of career prosecutors than an  office of people that come here to get a year or two of training and then join  the other side," said Christopher J. Evans, a deputy prosecutor and spokesman  for the association.  </P> <P> Salaries for county lawyers range from about $35,000 a year for the  least-experienced lawyers to $72,000 for the most senior deputies. The county  has refused to discuss its last salary offer, but lawyers in the bargaining  unit have said that the proposed increases range from 3.5% to 13.5%, to be  spread over the next two years, with the largest raises going to those at the  lower end of the pay scale.  </P> <P> The association first asked for a raise to bring members more in line with Los  Angeles County, which pays its senior deputies $94,000 a year. County lawyers  say they have since lowered their request but decline to specify.  </P> <P> The county's offer, Evans said, would do little to stem the attrition within  the county's legal staff: "We could not stand a similar attrition rate during  this contract period. It would be difficult to do the job the taxpayers and the  citizens want us to do to protect them from crime."  </P> <P> County negotiators dismiss such warnings as hyperbole.  </P> <P> David M. Carlaw, chief of county employee relations, estimated the turnover  rate among county lawyers last year at 14%, which he said was just slightly  higher than the countywide average of 10%. Carlaw said the association's  numbers are higher because they include those who have been promoted to other  jobs and those hired temporarily, who then left.  </P> <P> "They're pretty close" to the countywide attrition rate, Carlaw said. "A  certain amount of turnover is to be expected in any organization."  </P> <P> Evans insists that his association's figures are correct. As for those who have  left after being hired for a temporary assignment, Evans said many permanent  attorneys are classified as temporary so that the county does not have to pay  them benefits.  </P> <P> "They don't just come and go like grape (pickers)," Evans said. "It's not like  we expect a lot of drunk drivers one year, so we hire some migrant D.A.s."  </P> <P> Recent court decisions have raised questions about whether county prosecutors  and public defenders could legally strike. And both sides dismiss the  possibility of a strike as remote.  </P> <P> County deputy prosecutors and public defenders staged a sickout for several  days in July, 1979. It had little effect on criminal cases, which were handled  by management personnel, but it caused delays in the civil courts.  </P> <P> Evans said that his association started an "impasse resolution account" about a  month ago but that it is a misnomer to call it a strike fund. The money has  been used to pay the mailing and printing costs of keeping members informed of  the status of talks and the legal fees of the attorneys representing the  association at the bargaining table.  </P> <P> The money could be used, Evans conceded, to help members who participate in a  future job action. "We have no immediate plans for a strike," Evans said.  "We're not going to predict the future. We're hopeful and confident a  settlement can be worked out." ROSE ELLEN O'CONNOR  </P></p>

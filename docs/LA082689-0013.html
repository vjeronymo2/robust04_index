			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASSEMBLY SPEAKER BROWN'S CHARTERED JET PROPOSAL  </P> <P> Assembly Speaker Willie Brown should be denied his request for a chartered jet  ("Brown Wants State To Rent Jet for Use by Lawmakers," Part I, Aug. 17).  Lawmakers must suffer the same delays and indignities that their constituents  suffer at the airports and on the freeways of this state. They need to feel it  in the seat of their pants, like we do. How else are they going to stay in  touch with the needs of the electorate? How else are they going to represent us  and help improve the quality of our lives?  </P> <P> Leadership loses credibility when officials start "requiring" jets, limos and  other luxuries in the name of busy schedules. You're one of us, Willie! You  don't like airline congestion? Let us see you in there doing something about  it!  </P> <P> JAMES C. HOUGHTON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

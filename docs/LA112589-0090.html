			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEAD IN PAINT FORCES RECALL OF SLINKY TOYS  </P> <P> More than 40,000 Slinky animal pull toys have been recalled because paint used  on them may contain too much lead, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said.  </P> <P> The agency also says 234,000 clown dolls are being recalled because they pose a  choking hazard. The dolls, manufactured by Omaha-based Oriental Trading Co. and  sold through mail order catalogues as the "Dress Up Clown" or "Funny Clown,"  were recalled because they have small parts that present a choking risk to  young children.  </P></p>

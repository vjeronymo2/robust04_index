			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> GROUP PROVIDES NATURE'S THERAPY: FRIENDSHIP;  </P> <P> COMPEER: THE WORD MEANS "EQUAL, COMPANION, FRIEND, PEER." IT'S ALSO THE NAME OF  AN ORGANIZATION THAT MATCHES VOLUNTEERS WITH CLIENTS FOR ONE-ON-ONE  GET-TOGETHERS EACH WEEK FOR A YEAR. THE PROGRAM SEEMS TO BE SUCCESSFUL.  </P> <P> In 1976, Trudy Pembroke weighed 325 pounds. She was divorced, unemployable,  estranged from her family and confined to a state hospital in Rochester, N.Y.  </P> <P> Her grim history included a feeling at age 9 that something was terribly wrong  with her. At that age, she did not know that she was a victim of severe  depression and its devastating consequences. But she was to learn soon enough.  </P> <P> She attempted suicide half a dozen times, beginning at age 16. She was  frequently hospitalized for her mental illness.  </P> <P> She had her stomach stapled to lose weight and was admitted to a group home.  But the demons of overwhelming depression won again. Her spirit was broken, her  fragile self-esteem shattered. She was hospitalized yet again.  </P> <P> Life in a state hospital seemed her destiny.  </P> <P> Today, Pembroke is 41 and weighs 155 pounds. She has her own apartment with new  furniture. She earned an associate degree in college, bought a new car she  calls "Baby" and has a new job.  </P> <P> She is out of therapy and off all medication.  </P> <P> Was it a miracle? No, it was nature's medicine -- friendship.  </P> <P> Janice Wittmershaus, 33, a research physicist, was the friend. She befriended  Pembroke until Pembroke was well enough to be her own friend.  </P> <P> But Wittmershaus' and Pembroke's paths probably would never have crossed if not  for an unusual nonprofit organization called Compeer.  </P> <P> "Compeer is the best antidepressant in the world," Pembroke said.  </P> <P> Its premise is simply the power of friendship.  </P> <P> Headquartered in Rochester, Compeer began with 10 patients and 10 volunteers  and was called "Adopt-A-Patient." In 1976, Bernice Skirboll answered a  help-wanted ad and took over.  </P> <P> She found the name too patronizing and thumbed through her dictionary. She  found "compeer." The definition: "equal, companion, friend, peer."  </P> <P> In 1977, Skirboll registered the name with the federal government, began  raising money and expanded the group to an organization that has helped more  than 10,000 mentally and emotionally handicapped people in 119 cities in 37  states and Canada.  </P> <P> The compeer contracts to spend one hour a week with the client for a year. The  volunteers undergo brief training. They meet with a therapist if indicated and  submit written monthly reports.  </P> <P> Skirboll said the backup support for each volunteer costs about $450 a year,  about what it would cost to keep a patient in a hospital for three days.  </P> <P> The program exists from Gainesville, Fla., to Portland, Ore., from Augusta,  Me., to San Diego and in smaller cities like Grand Haven, Mich., and Great  Bend, Kan. Each has its own budget, some as high as $150,000. The national norm  is $25,000.  </P> <P> Pembroke decided to go public with her story to try to eradicate the stigma the  mentally ill suffer.  </P> <P> Her story is that of a product of a broken home, a survivor of foster homes and  a father she could never please.  </P> <P> "I could have become President of the United States and it would not have been  good enough for him," she said. "I carried that attitude into my adult life."  </P> <P> She has not seen her father or spoken to him or any of her four sisters in the  last 10 years, although they all live within 50 miles. Her mother is dead.  </P> <P> "The last time I spoke to him, he said the next thing he wanted to hear about  me was that I was dead," Pembroke said. "I told him I would abide by his  wishes, but that I still loved him. His voice cracked a little and he said:  'OK. Goodby.' "  </P> <P> "I got married at 20 for all the wrong reasons," she said. "I didn't love him,  but I was fat and ugly and I knew no one else would ever ask me." The marriage  lasted eight years.  </P> <P> By the time Wittmershaus met Pembroke in 1983, she was living in a halfway  house, but she was thinking of returning to the state hospital, to the wards  she knew all too well.  </P> <P> Pembroke was in the state hospital when she was paired with her first compeer.  The woman lost touch with Pembroke six years later when she moved from  Rochester.  </P> <P> Bernice arranged for Wittmershaus to take over Pembroke's case. But after the  second or third visit, Pembroke told Wittmershaus not to bother to come back.  </P> <P> "I did everything I could to sabotage the relationship," Pembroke said. "I  wouldn't talk to her sometimes when she came." Other times, she would just cry,  but she could not articulate what was wrong.  </P> <P> But Wittmershaus was as tenacious as Pembroke. She just kept coming back.  Eventually, they started going out for coffee; they fed ducks on a pond; they  went window-shopping; they went to the circus, to movies.  </P> <P> "I finally started talking a little bit," Pembroke recalls. "I would ask her  why she would want to come and see me. Why should anyone care about me? She  showed me what a true friend is. Since Janice, I know what a relationship is."  </P> <P> Pembroke wanted to return to the hospital. She felt she could not make it on  the outside. Wittmershaus kept saying: "Yes, you can," words that eventually  Pembroke came to believe.  </P> <P> When Pembroke started college, as Wittmershaus was studying for her master's  degree, they would often study together.  </P> <P> After Pembroke got her degree, she had about 35 interviews before she finally  got a job.  </P> <P> After she had been with Pembroke for three years, Wittmershaus' husband left  the University of Rochester for a job in Phoenix. But Janet and Pembroke's  friendship, while no longer an official compeer match, has survived.  </P> <P> Wittmershaus calls Pembroke about twice a month and Pembroke writes to her.  Last year for her birthday, Wittmershaus and her husband sent Pembroke a  round-trip ticket to spend two weeks with them in Phoenix.  </P> <P> Pembroke no longer has, or needs, an official compeer. She has made a few  friends on her own, always with Wittmershaus' encouragement.  </P> <P> Pembroke, blessed with a gift for public speaking, volunteers as a speaker for  Compeer. She tells her audience she is going to talk about a mentally ill  person. She then gives her own life story.  </P> <P> Compeer has become more sophisticated than it was in the early days and tries  to match people with something in common. Wittmershaus and Pembroke really had  nothing in common, but one example in Harlem reflects the extent to which  Compeer now tries to make these friendships work.  </P> <P> The volunteer and the client were originally from Jamaica and both were very  interested in music, especially reggae, the music of the island. So John Bent,  39, a victim of schizophrenia, became the friend of Howard Clarke, 22, a senior  at Lehman College.  </P> <P> The Rev. Robert Smalls of the Macedonia Baptist Church and the Compeer director  at the Upper Manhattan Mental Health Clinic brought the two together a few  months ago.  </P> <P> Bent, whose disease dates from his student days in Manchester, England, has few  friends and is frightened to leave the house. The voices that bedevil him,  despite medication, get louder; the hallucinations become three-dimensional. If  he is with someone, however, it is easier.  </P> <P> Clarke brings records and videos to the four-story walk-up that Bent shares  with his wife and five children.  </P> <P> Despite the age difference, both are students in their own way. On one of their  recent visits, Clarke asked if Bent knew anything about the Dutch philosopher  Spinoza, the subject of one of his classes that afternoon. It turned out he  did. So instead of listening to music as usual, the two chatted about  philosophy.  </P> <P> Neal Brown, director of community support for the National Institutes of Mental  Health in Rockville, Md., said Compeer "seems to be very effective."  </P> <P> "Everybody who has been involved with them has nothing to say but good about  them," Brown said. He added, however, that the program has not been evaluated  objectively and scientifically.  </P> <P> The studies in Rochester, where the program began, indicate that Compeer  significantly cuts the rate of a patient's re-entry into an institution.  </P> <P> Sixty percent of previously hospitalized patients return at some point, mental  health professionals say. Among the Compeer clients, that number has dropped to  15%, Skirboll said.  </P> <P> Although Compeer gets some government money, it also gets donations from such  corporations as Xerox, Citibank, Eastman Kodak, Honeywell, AT&amp;T, General  Motors and Merrill Lynch.  </P> <P> Dr. Martin von Holden, executive director of Rochester Psychiatric Center, said  he has 80 Compeer volunteers working in the hospital, a facility with 500  patients and 200 outpatients.  </P> <P> "It's a wonderful way to transition a patient from the hospital to a halfway  house or group home," Von Holden said.  </P></p>

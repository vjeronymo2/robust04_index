			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / UK Company News: New acquisitions behind 18% jump to Pounds 6.2m at SBJ ACQUISITIONS BY Steel Burrill Jones, the insurance group, allowed pre-tax profits to rise 18 per cent to Pounds 6.23m in the six months to June 30. However, organic growth proved disappointing. Turnover rose 20 per cent to Pounds 24.5m, while expenses increased 23 per cent to Pounds 22.3m. Mr Tony Keys, finance director, said profits would have fallen without the contributions from SBJ Regis Low and Nelson Steavenson Bloodstock, which were bought earlier this year. He said underlying expenses - disallowing the impact of the new companies - were down 3 per cent, as a result of staff reductions and tight control on wage increases. The acquisitions also helped boost investment and other income to Pounds 3.8m, compared with Pounds 2.8m last time. Income fell from divisions including SBJ Oil &amp; Gas, SBJ Marine and the North American operations, which experienced increased competition. Earnings per share fell 1.15p to 8.77p but the interim dividend is maintained at 4.25p. Mr David Beresford Jones, chairman, admitted that the results had not fulfilled directors' expectations at the time of the 1991 annual report, due mainly to a disappointing performance from wholesale insurance. He said he saw no signs of improvement during the rest of the year for the company's three principal areas of activity. He anticipated continued difficulties for wholesale insurance and lower profitability from Regis Low than during its last year before acquisition.</p>

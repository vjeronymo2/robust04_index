[Aguirre] I see it as being unconcerned with its future.  There is currently a struggle going on for the prevalence of  each sector's interests within the party itself. There are many  leaders who are worried over their personal situation and their  political survival, waiting to see which faction leader can give  them relative security or an election guarantee. The  Herreraist, Lacalle's, faction is worried about its candidate  and the need to constitute a majority within the party. The  National Rocha Movement (MNR) is concerned with the same thing.  Many leaders from the now dissolved movement For The Fatherland  seem to be concerned with finding a place that will guarantee  them a political future after 1995. I do not observe a general  concern, as it should be, for the electoral triumph of the  National Party.    [BUSQUEDA] There are at least six sectors led by important  National Party members (Lacalle, Pereyra, Aguirre, Zumaran,  Abreu, Ramos) but it is not known how they will vote. Isn't the  National Party's supply of candidates too confusing?    [Aguirre] The party has three movements represented at a  national level: the Herreraist faction, the MNR, and the Renewal  and Victory Movement [MRV]. There are other new groups formed  around some leaders who still do not have a national presence.  Their intention is form alliances or reach agreements with the  existing organized factions. Last 14 December at the Cambadu  [Association of Uruguayan Retail Merchants, Bar Owners, and  Related Businessman], before 3,000 party members, I said that  there are many party members who do not belong to the MNR or to  Lacalle's faction, and who would be attracted by a force  grouping together those with a common party origin and with a  similar vision about the future of the country. I am willing to  lead this group. I will not act as a spare tire for anyone, and  I am not willing to place everything that I built up from  scratch, with a lot of effort between 1987 and 1989, at the  service of others.    [BUSQUEDA] Then will you be a presidential candidate?    [Aguirre] I am willing to be a candidate if my political  friends so desire.    [BUSQUEDA] With how many candidates will the National Party  run?    [Aguirre] At least three. Some citizens will never vote for  Carlos Julio Pereyra or for Lacalle's candidate. To force them  to vote for one of them would be a bad electoral strategy for  the National Party.    [BUSQUEDA] The Herreraist faction estimates that the best  electoral advantage for the National Party will be the results  of the economic policy. Do you agree with this?    [Aguirre] The best proposal will be that which adopts the  wisest approach to the national problems. Candidates must speak  not of what has happened, but of what is to come. It is true  that the good results from the economic policy will be important  for the success of the party. But this success will not come  about just because the president or the economy minister keep  telling the people that the economic situation is very good. If  the people feel that the situation is good, they will recognize  this without needing anyone to tell them so, and they will vote  accordingly. I nonetheless think that the people, unfairly,  continue to perceive the economic situation as bad, even though  the great majority of the people are better off at present.    [BUSQUEDA] Why do you think this is so?    [Aguirre] There is a problem with the government spokesmen.  They tend not to announce the good news and to stress the  unpopular measures. For example, instead of telling the retired  workers how good it is that they are better off now than in the  past, they are told that they constitute a serious problem for  the country. People get mad when they are blamed by their  governors of something for which they are not responsible.    [BUSQUEDA] What do you think of President Lacalle's active  participation in public acts during an election year?    [Aguirre] The president of the Republic is making an  enormous  effort, carrying out very intense activity, according to his  personality, and perhaps this will help improve the government's  image and the party's possibilities. However, in the final  stages of the campaign, in the last three or four months, this  will not either help or hinder us. The protagonist cannot be  someone who cannot be a candidate according to the Constitution.  The protagonists must be the candidates. Those who will  compete in the race will be those who sign up to run, and  Lacalle is prohibited from signing up to run for this race.    [BUSQUEDA] What is the situation of the MRV after former  Ministers Ramos and Abreu, and some deputies and other leaders,  left the faction?    [Aguirre] From the electoral point of view their  estrangement  was not important. They brought prestige to the MRV when they  held public posts, but they are not backed by any national  political current. If not, they should demonstrate it in the  elections. In 1989 the people voted for Gonzalo Aguirre.  Besides, even though those citizens left, others are coming in.  During the rally at Cambadu I had the honor of having Professor  Juan Pivel Devoto sitting by my side, as well as Paysandu Mayor  Jorge Larranaga, Carlos Rodriguez Labruna [former education  under secretary], former Deputy Elias Porras Larralde, and Jose  Radiccioni.</p>

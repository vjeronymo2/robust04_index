			<p>BFN     [Text] It will be recalled that three days ago, the  Nigerian police declared Chief M.K.O. Abiola wanted in  connection with some alleged treasonable activities. A few  hours ago, Mohamed Okoija took up the deputy inspector general  of police, Nuhu Aliyu, on the progress in the police search for  Chief Abiola.    [Begin recording] [Aliyu] Yesterday, we carried out some  searches of some areas where we suspected he could be found but  he wasn't there.    [Okoija] Now, in the news today, one of his wives, [name  indistinct], says Chief Abiola is ill and will report to the  police when he is well. Has this got to you officially?    [Aliyu, hesitating] To the police that he is....[pauses]  Yes,  it got to us officially, and [words indistinct].    [Okoija] Well, Chief Abiola's camp continues to affirm that  he proclaimed himself as president, and there were pictures in  the papers on Tuesday [14 June] which purported that to be so.  What is the police reaction to this one now?    [Aliyu] Our reaction is that that was one of the gimmicks,  of  photoplay. We don't believe there was anything like that.    [Okoija] Okay. Now, a former senator who is an aide to Chief  Abiola says that....    [Aliyu, interrupting] Pardon?    [Okoija] A former senator who is an aide to Chief Abiola  says  Chief Abiola will address his supporters anytime from now, and  that they have their own strategy.    [Aliyu] As soon as we find Abiola, we will pick him up.  Anywhere, anywhere he shows up, we will pick him up. Anywhere  we see him. After all, he is a wanted person.    [Okoija] Now, what about this threat of chaos in the western  part of the country? How prepared is the police, knowing that  the western part of the country is a hotbed of political riot?    [Aliyu] As you can see, we have got ourselves well prepared.  Not only have we mobilized the police within the area in  question, but we have brought in other policemen, mobile police  forces from other parts of the country, to beef up security in  this area. [end recording]    [Paris AFP in English at 1212 GMT on 15 June, in a  Lagos-datelined item, says: "Moshood Abiola, the tycoon who has  declared himself president of Nigeria, will make a public  appearance `this week' in defiance of the junta which is hunting  him, an opposition spokesman said Wednesday. The national  secretary of the National Democratic Coalition, which backs  Abiola's claim to power, said Abiola will `definitely (come out  of hiding) this week.' `It will be a public event, at which the  press, including the international media, will be in  attendance,' the secretary, Ayo Opadokun, said as the junta took  steps to beef up security in the southwestern regions where the  Yoruba businessman draws much of his support."]</p>

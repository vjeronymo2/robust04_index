			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SAN JUAN'S BAN ON DEVELOPMENT IS EXTENDED  </P> <P> The San Juan Capistrano City Council has extended for 6 months a moratorium on  new development until the city's General Plan can be meshed with requirements  of a slow-growth measure adopted by voters Nov. 8.  </P> <P> City Councilman Phillip R. Schwartze said the extension will allow the city to  take care of legal and procedural concerns surrounding slow-growth Measure X.  </P> <P> A planning study to determine the extent of changes to be made should be  completed in 90 days, he said.  </P> <P> A 45-day moratorium, originally approved by the council Dec. 6, restricts  residential, commercial and industrial development in the city, Schwartze said.  </P> <P> It has been challenged by two lawsuits since its passage.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the City Council hired Daniel K. Spradlin, a Santa Ana attorney, to  defend it in the suits.  </P> <P> The extension was approved on a 4-0 vote. Mayor Pro Tem Lawrence F. Buchheim  was absent.  </P></p>

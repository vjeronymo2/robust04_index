			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Accounts body chief calls for audits shake-up Auditors should be seen to act more independently of company executives and public-sector bodies, the chairman of the Accounts Commission of Scotland said yesterday. Mr Ian Percy, who is also a senior partner with accountants Grant Thornton, called for a shake-up in the reporting structures of public and private-sector auditing in a speech to the conference of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy. 'The auditor is becoming the tool of the finance officer,' he said after his speech yesterday. 'There must be mechanisms to ensure that they are auditing the finance function.' Mr Percy called for the adoption by public-sector bodies of the recommendations of the Cadbury committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance, which was originally aimed at quoted companies. He said that councils and other public-sector organisations should create audit committees to improve effectiveness and reporting on financial matters. Mr Percy called for greater independence of regulation, with the need for a body separated from the professional accountancy bodies, and with lay membership to set standards and ethics and to discipline firms. He said accountancy firms should respond to the perceived threat to objectivity when auditors provide other services to their clients. Company audit committees should approve any non-audit work undertaken by the auditor, he said, while the accountancy firm's audit engagement partner should not be pressured into cross-selling other services to the client. Mr Percy also criticised the proposed merger of the UK's six principal professional accountancy bodies as 'monopolistic'. In an effort to boost personal responsibility, Mr Percy said the engagement partner in an accountancy firm should be prepared to sign the audit report in a company's accounts in his or her own name rather than in the name of the firm.

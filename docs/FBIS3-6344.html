			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Prime Minister Chuan Likphai at a banquet held in </F> his honor by SRV Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet in Hanoi on 16 March  -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] I am very pleased to learn  that our countries have closely cooperated with each other in  financial services and investment markets. The Bank of Thailand  and the Securities Exchange of Thailand will render cooperation  to and closely coordinate with the Vietnamese national bank.  Such exchanges of experience and information will help  strengthen the financial services of the two countries. I  believe we all agree that the present world economic system will  advance firmly if we can build up and develop a strong base in  financial services. We must be prepared for rapidly increasing  competition. The cooperation which exists under the principle  of good understanding and mutual benefit will form an important  foundation for multilateral relations, which will lead to a  collaboration of quality power [khunaphap phalang]. I believe  that good relations among the countries in the region,  especially the countries in the Mekong River basin, will enable  us to cope with problems that may arise in sharing the use of  natural resources. We will work to jointly preserve and improve  the environment to benefit our present and future generations.  [passage omitted]    During my visit to Vietnam, leading figures from business  institutions in major fields are joining the trip so they will  be directly informed of certain policies of both Thailand and  Vietnam that will promote trade and investment. This will  create mutual benefit within a definite framework and  regulations. They will be able to observe the economic  potential of Vietnam. Furthermore, both sides must carry out  necessary activities to promote trade and investment cooperation  by supplying each other with clear and correct information.  Therefore, I am pleased that Thai and Vietnamese investment  promotion organizations have jointly organized a seminar to seek  ways to further expand trade and investment cooperation.

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Sweeping changes to judiciary planned Delegates yesterday approved a motion calling for the abolition of the ancient office of Lord Chancellor and new procedures to subject the appointment of judges and magistrates to public scrutiny. Under its terms the Lord Chancellor and his department would be replaced by a ministry of justice. Mr Richard Rosser, accepting the motion on behalf of the national executive committee, said the legal system needed to be changed to provide meaningful rights of access to justice for the individual citizen. Judges were attacked by delegates for being 'aged and white' and cossetted in luxury mansions when presiding over courts outside London. One delegate complained that the judiciary was dominated by 'privately educated Oxbridge people who sometimes appear to come from another planet'.</p>

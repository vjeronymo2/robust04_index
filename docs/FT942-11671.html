			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restructuring of Eastern Germany (19): Long way from Santa Clara - Investment case study, SMI Microelectronics You only have to stand in the small 'clean' room at SMI to grasp what is taking place in this US-backed microelectronics enterprise at Markendorf, near Frankfurt an der Oder on the Polish border. Through the windows on one side of the room one sees the remnants of eastern Germany's old microelectronics industry. It is a big workshop, decked with large computers, some covered with plastic sheets. On the other side of this insulated room is a small, modern testing station installed last year and poised to supply its products to the European market. The east German engineers, dressed like surgeons, quietly pass from one old world of increasingly out-dated technology to the new laboratory. They are symbols of transition taking place in the east German economy. But it has been a hard slog for Mr George Brown, the director of System Microelectronic Innovation, or SMI, and a far cry from Synergy Semiconductor Corporation, his parent company in Santa Clara, California. 'It has been slower than we expected, but we are getting there,' said Mr Brown, whose offices overlook what was once eastern Germany's main microelectronic enterprise. In a search for more capacity, the US company bought a 49 per cent stake in the old VEB Halbleitwerk from the Treuhand privatisation agency in March 1993. The Kombinate, or enterprise, used to employ 8,000 people and was one of the main enterprises supplying the circuits for the east German consumer market - mostly for television sets. But following German unification, the collapse of the east European and Russian markets, and the exposure of the Kombinate to competition, the Treuhand pared down the work force to 1,200 and set about preparing it for privatisation. Mr Brown, whose US company was also seeking a foothold in Europe, eventually acquired the stake and a reduced workforce of little more than 600. Boosted by investment grants from the eastern state of Brandenburg and from the federal government, and a commitment by the Treuhand to pick up losses and redundancy payments, he agreed to initially invest DM45m for new equipment to produce ECL logic devices and ECL RAMS, used mostly in radio equipment. Initially it had been hoped that SMI could continue to hold on to some of its east European, Russian and east German customers, which before unification accounted for almost 100 per cent of the company's turnover. But the shortage of hard currency and the need to find a niche in the European market meant that Mr Brown had to reverse the company's strategy towards the west. The first year was spent on completely modernising the plant, and introducing new product lines. This meant training the engineers, either in Santa Clara, or bringing over US engineers to SMI. During this time, the company's turnover to the eastern European and local east German market virtually collapsed, falling from DM70m in 1991/92 to nil by the end of last year. 'We now have only one option. We must continue to invest, and heavily. What we are bringing here is technology, knowhow and a new product idea. But it will take time to turn the company around,' said Mr Brown. Like the 'clean room', the company finds itself in a finely balanced period of transition. As testing takes time, and money - it has already received quality certification for one of its locally produced integrated circuit lines - it must utilise its capacity to gain turnover before new lines are ready for full production. Currently, the plant is operating at 20 per cent capacity. But increasingly, as investments lead to production, SMI is subcontracting as an interim measure - 'we have five foundry customers, some for Europe, others for the US,' said Mr Brown, adding that SMI is trying to attract companies which have neither enough or no capacity for production. Already SMI is supplying Grundig, Blaupunkt and automobile manufacturers with its products. Sub-contracting now accounts for nearly two-thirds, or DM18m, of SMI's turnover and capacity is expected to reach 50 per cent by the end of this year. Turnover for this year could reach DM46m. But neither Mr Brown nor Mr Max-Eberhard Losel, the manager of the enterprise, wants SMI to evolve into a business anchored on subcontracting. The raison d'etre of the enterprise is to develop and market its own products, particularly analog designs - circuits for radio-controlled clocks, power switches and high frequency integrated circuits for telecommunications. 'Foundry business is very competitive. But it is a fairly low margin business,' said Mr Losel. 'You can't build a business on it alone. We need high value-added products and innovative products which can ultimately create high technology jobs.' Through their investment programme, Mr Brown and Mr Losel want to enter the high end of the market. In short, they want to adopt the 'leap-frog' approach, whereby they can skip the intermediate technology by introducing the highest levels of innovation. But the sprawling 1 sq km large site which they have inherited does not lend itself easily to the leap-frog theory largely because SMI, unlike some other west German electronic companies, was not in a position to acquire a greenfield site and build a completely new company. This means that the first two years will be spent modernising, updating and equipping SMI with new technology. 'What we want to do here requires a different know-how. We need to work much more efficiently to cover costs. We are even occupying more space than we need,' said Mr Brown. That was why SMI's management was interested in acquiring partners. It has been a slow process, but Mr Brown and his colleagues reckon that by the end of 1994, its own new products will be on line. 'It has taken time. Maybe we didn't expect the complete collapse of the east European and Russian markets. Maybe we did not anticipate the recession in Germany,' said Mr Brown. 'But we have extra capacity here and we have Europe as our market and that's where we are heading.'</p>

The exclusion applies during temporary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interruptions in school attendance, provided the child's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enrollment will resume following the break. If the child's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> earnings or amount of work performed cannot be differentiated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from that of other household members, the total earnings are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prorated equally among the working members and the child's pro  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rata share is excluded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under current regulations, individuals are considered children if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they are under the parental control of another household member.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The exclusion does not apply if the student has formed a separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> household. No distinction is made between students who live with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their parents in a separate food stamp household and students who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> live separately from parents. In addition, the regulations do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not specify what type of educational institution the student must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be attending (high school, college, vocational training, etc.).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 13911 of the 1993 Leland Act amended section 5(d)(7) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act, 7 U.S.C. 2014(d)(7), to exclude ``income earned by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> child who is a member of the household, who is an elementary or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> secondary school student, and who is 21 years of age or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> younger *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The legislative history (House Report 103&hyph;111, pp.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 27&hyph;28) indicates that the provision is intended to assist  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> families with high school students whose education has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delayed (for example, students who have to learn English in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classroom) and who have not been able to complete high school  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before age 18. Under current rules, the income of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students would be counted in determining the eligibility and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits of the household and could result in a reduction in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> family's benefits or ineligibility. The Report also indicates at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> p. 28 that ``[t]he Committee wishes to emphasize that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendment in no way changes current law regarding those students  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who live away from home and have formed a separate household.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several issues have arisen in connection with the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision that will continue to be relevant under the changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed to implement section 13911 of the 1993 Leland Act. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue has been whether a student has to be under the parental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control of a household member, as currently required, for his or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> her income to be excluded. Parental control was the issue in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1989 lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> District of Maine ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Dion v. Commissioner, Maine Department of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Social Services v. Sullivan and Yeutter. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The case involved a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high school student under 18 with a child. The student and child  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lived with the student's parents but were certified as a separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> food stamp household. The State agency did not exclude the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student's earnings from part-time work because the student was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not under parental control. The District Court decided that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parental control provision of the current regulations was invalid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because the Act does not expressly contain such a limitation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This decision was subsequently upheld by the First Circuit Court  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Appeals, 933 F.2d 13 (1st Cir. 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The statutory language of section 13911 does not specifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restrict the student income exclusion to students living with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their parents or under the parental control of another adult.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under a literal reading of the amended statute, the exclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would apply to any high school or elementary school student under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 22, even if the student was living separately from his or her  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parents. The House Report at p. 28 indicates, however, that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclusion was not intended to apply to students who have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established a separate residence. Both the House Report and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Dion  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> decision support allowing the exclusion to students who live  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with their parents but who may have a separate food stamp  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> household. This is a middle position between the extremes of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unrestricted exclusion and one limited to students under parental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control, and it is the position we are proposing to adopt. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> invite comments concerning the best way to implement this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision so as to limit the income exclusion to the households  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress intended to help without placing an unnecessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative burden on households and State agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this rule we are proposing to amend 7 CFR 273.9(c)(7) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide that the earned income of elementary or high school  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students who are 21 years of age or younger and living with their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parents (rather than in a separate living arrangement) shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excluded. The exclusion would apply if the student is in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same food stamp household as a natural, adoptive or step-parent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or is under the parental control of another member of the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> food stamp household. The exclusion would also be allowed if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student is in a separate food stamp household but is living with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a natural, adoptive or step-parent. Parental control would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be a factor if the student is in a separate food stamp household.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another issue concerning the income of students that has come to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> our attention is whether to require that students be attending  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> school at least half-time for the exclusion to apply. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legislative history of section 13911 of the 1993 Leland Act did  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not address this issue. However, because the legislation extends  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the exclusion to students age 21 and under, we believe it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important that the exclusion be limited only to those students  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who are seriously pursuing a regular high school diploma or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> General Equivalency Diploma (GED). According to House Report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 103&hyph;111, Congress intended this income exclusion to assist  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> households in which a student's education has been delayed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Frequently, students who have dropped out of school for a time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decide to obtain a GED instead of a regular high school diploma.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These students may be earning sufficient income to adversely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affect the household's benefits if the earnings were counted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, we are proposing that the earned income of elementary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or high school students be excluded if the student is attending  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> school (including GED classes) at least half-time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

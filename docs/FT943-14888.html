			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of World Automotive Components (2): Demand likely to accelerate - Forecasts suggest new car sales will rise this year New car sales worldwide are expected to rise by more than 5 per cent this year, ending three years of falling demand and providing increased orders to the automotive components supply industry. Car sales fell last year to a six-year low, but demand is forecast to begin a sustained period of growth in 1994 rising to record levels throughout the second half of the 1990s, according to the latest study by DRI/McGraw-Hill1, the London-based automotive analysts. While worldwide new car sales are forecast to rise by 5.4 per cent this year to 34.95m units from 33.2m in 1993, in the longer term DRI suggests that sales could increase by close to 30 per cent to 42.5m in 1999. Much of this growth will originate outside the traditional car consuming regions of western Europe, North America and Japan, however, with South Korea, China, Thailand, Latin America and eastern Europe offering the best growth prospects for the 1990s and beyond. The short-term recovery is being driven chiefly by the strong rise in demand in North America. New car sales in the US and Canada are forecast to increase by 11 per cent to 10.46m this year. The latest DRI forecast suggests that the recession in the new car markets of western Europe and Japan has also bottomed out, and the focus for growth is expected to switch to these regions next year. 'The relatively prolonged recovery phase in Europe and Japan, plus the take-off of developing countries particularly in Asia, should set the scene for a steady improvement towards record levels of global car demand throughout the mid-1990s,' says the study. Sales in western Europe are set to rise by 3 per cent or more this year to 11.8m-11.9m, as the region begins to recover from last year's precipitous decline of 15 per cent, the biggest drop of the post-war period. The recovery in Europe will gather pace in 1995 as both the German and Italian markets emerge more firmly from recession, and sales in western Europe are forecast to rise by between 6 and 7 per cent in each of the three years from 1995. The DRI forecast suggests that western European new car sales will finally equal the previous peak years of 1991/92 in 1996 at around 13.45m. It expects continuing strong growth for the rest of the decade with new car sales rising to 15m in 1999. However, a much less optimistic forecast has recently been issued by the Economist Intelligence Unit2, which maintains that 'the scope for western Europe's new car market to achieve growth beyond pre-recession levels in the next few years is limited'. After recovering to 13.15m in 1996 new car sales are forecast by the EIU to remain within the range of 13m-13.5m for the rest of the decade. While new car sales in Japan are forecast by DRI to rise by 5 per cent next year - after falling for three years in succession from 1991 to 1993 - the record level of 5.1m reached in 1990 is unlikely to be exceeded this decade. The rate of decline in new car sales in Japan is slowing, and DRI forecasts a marginal rise in the whole of the year to 4.2m. While the market may be bottoming out this year Japanese domestic car production is likely to suffer a further fall by around 3 per cent to 8.3m, a fourth successive annual decline from 9.9m in 1990. In North America, new car sales and production are rising strongly this year, but DRI says that the 'economy and car market now appears to be moving fast towards a cyclical peak in 1994. 'This will be a great year in the light vehicle market (in North America), but a combination of disappointing replacement demand, rising short-term interest rates and weakening consumer confidence in an economy, which cannot retain 1994's momentum, will lead to reduced car volumes in 1995.' Unlike some of the US vehicle makers, DRI is cautious about growth prospects for the remainder of the decade in North America. It forecasts total light vehicle production rising only to 15.25m by 1999 with virtually all the production growth coming in light trucks rather than in cars. There is expected to be continuing strong growth in both sales and production in the Asia/Pacific region (excluding Japan). New car sales in this region have already grown significantly from 1.96m in 1989 to 2.8m last year and sales are forecast to jump again to 4.6m by 1999. Sales in China could more than double, according to forecasts, from 430,000 last year to 1.1m in 1999, while new car sales in South Korea are forecast to grow by 50 per cent during the same period to 1.45m in 1999 from 963,000 last year. Thailand, Malaysia and India are also expected to be strong growth markets. The growth in new car production in China is forecast to be even more impressive with output nearly quadrupling from 241,000 last year to 925,000 by the end of the decade. South Korean car makers are also urgently adding new capacity to make good their threat to break into the front rank of the world's auto makers. The DRI report suggests that new car production in Korea could jump from 1.5m last year to 2.6m by 1999. 1 DRI World Car Industry Forecast Report. Price Pounds 3,100.

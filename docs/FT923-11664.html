			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / SFO in court challenge on Nadir THE Serious Fraud Office yesterday began a High Court challenge against a judge's decision to throw out 46 charges of theft totalling Pounds 119.5m against Mr Asil Nadir, the former chairman of Polly Peck International, John Mason writes. At an earlier hearing, the trial judge, Mr Justice Tucker, dismissed the charges relating to the transfer of money from PPI to Unipac, a subsidiary company, saying Mr Nadir had authority for those transactions. Mr Robert Owen QC for the SFO, later said the judge had made an error of law that amounted to 'a fraudster's charter'. Contrary to the judge's ruling, Mr Nadir did not have authority for the transfers from PPI to Unipac, since the money was destined for himself or his private interests, Mr Owen said yesterday. The SFO was alleging that Mr Nadir stole Pounds 150m from the parent company between August 1987 and August 1990, he said. Mr Nadir used the Unipac subsidiary as a conduit because it gave the appearance of legitimacy. The 16 theft charges now against Mr Nadir relate only to money transferred out from the Unipac subsidiary. If the SFO succeeds in restoring the charges, the cash transfers from PPI, rather than Unipac, will form the basis of its case against Mr Nadir. The hearing is expected to end today.</p>

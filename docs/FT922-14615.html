			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Tokyo visit will help to rehabilitate China WHEN Jiang Zemin, the Chinese Communist party chief, lands in Toyko today he will be confident that his Japanese hosts will avoid the sensitive human rights questions that would inevitably be asked during a visit to Europe or the US. The five-day visit, the first by a party general secretary since 1983, will be another important step towards international respectability for the Chinese leadership, which is still tainted by the crushing of the pro-democracy movement three years ago. Jiang wants to direct Japanese attention to a just-completed sitting of the Chinese parliament, which re-embraced the principles of economic reform and strengthened the position of reformers within the Communist party. However, he could face queries over a touchy territorial issue, the ownership of five uninhabited islands in the South China Sea known to Japan as the Senkaku group and to China as the Diaoyutai group. Japanese say that a likely invitation from the Chinese leader for Emperor Akihito to visit Beijing later this year will receive a non-committal response until both countries agree that the islands are Japanese property. Japan will ask that Jiang use his influence to dissuade North Korea from developing nuclear weapons, as Tokyo has been made uneasy by Pyongyang's persistent failure to permit inspections of its nuclear-related sites. Beijing and Tokyo will congratulate each other on a fast-expanding economic relationship, although Jiang is likely to warn that a rapid increase in Japanese exports could become a bilateral problem. Chinese officials have expressed concern about a 59.8 per cent increase in Japanese exports in February, compared to a year earlier, and a 36.1 per cent increase in exports to Hong Kong, many of which are thought to have entered southern China. Tokyo insists that the dramatic increase is a natural result of the surge in China's economy over the past year, and that it also reflects the rapid development of export-oriented factories using components made in Japan. If the human rights issue is raised, it will be done in the traditional, polite way, with Japanese officials encouraging Jiang to improve relations with the US and then making an indirect reference to Washington's concerns about human rights. Jiang will ensure he is not too deferential to his hosts. During a 1983 visit, the late Hu Yaobang bowed in front of Japanese leaders, and this was cited by China's elderly revolutionaries as a good reason for his dismissal in 1987.</p>

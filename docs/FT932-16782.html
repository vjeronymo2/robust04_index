			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Markets: How BM dug itself a hole - The Bottom Line A YEAR ago BM Group, the construction equipment and engineering concern, was basking in its reputation for bucking the trend after reporting record pre-tax profits of Pounds 34.6m on sales of Pounds 519m. This year it is forecast to lose Pounds 30m and the question is: will it go bust? Bank debt and finance leases had risen from Pounds 61m to Pounds 105m in the six months to December 31. Stock finance and other liabilities amounted to Pounds 41m. Now, net assets - including an overvalued pension fund surplus - are draining away to less than Pounds 120m and bank covenants are being breached. After weeks of talks with its banks, BM still has no standstill agreement. The share price, which peaked at 425p in October 1991, fell from 47p last Friday night to 18p on Thursday, ending at 21p yesterday. Some institutions have been replaced by smaller speculative investors. As the struggle for survival goes on, crumbs of comfort are offered by the rescue plan, which envisages disposals that might raise the best part of Pounds 40m. Cost cuts, including 1,000 of the 6,900 workforce, are already in train. Whether the banks give these measures time to work depends on their view of what might be raised in a fire sale by receivers. Some reassurance may be gleaned from the unsecured nature of most of the bank debt; they do not have a privileged position in the creditors' queue. It remains unclear what might emerge at the end of the process. Moger Woolley, the new chairman, has a background in manufacturing, but the outcome will be as strongly influenced by what can best be sold to reduce debt. Those contemplating the odds on survival probably have little time to reflect on what has gone wrong. But that remains a big question, particularly in the week that David Tweedie, chairman of the Accounting Standards Board, launched an assault on acquisition accounting. BM was founded by Roger Shute, whose original enterprise centred on the import of Hitachi excavators. His persuasive creed was that a company could buck recessionary trends through hard work and hard selling. 'If you work 16 hours a day, seven days a week, you do better than the slob who works five hours a day, three days a week,' he said. Before the acquisition of Blackwood Hodge in autumn 1990, BM was ungeared and had been frugal in the issue of shares. Earnings per share were always Shute's god - that was what the City wanted. Between 1983-84, when it came to the market by reversing into Braham Millar, and 1989-90, pre-tax profits multiplied from Pounds 560,000 to Pounds 23.1m and sales reached Pounds 228m. Since 1989, however, the UK market for construction equipment is estimated to have shrunk by nearly two thirds, the US by nearly 40 per cent, Australia by more than half. Yet BM's profits kept rising - helped by the Blackwood Hodge acquisition. True, there were trading and tax-related synergies. And the bad news - reorganisation costs, stock write-offs and pre-acquisition losses - was shovelled through the balance sheet in the form of a Pounds 35m reduction in net assets. The provisions set up in the process helped cushion future profits. But the strain on the balance sheet began to show. On the last day of 1990-91, a Pounds 9m disposal helped BM reach its gearing target of about 70 per cent. Early last year, the Pounds 60m rights issue (at 330p a share) accompanying the Thomas Robinson acquisition raised Pounds 20m more than was needed to relieve Robinson's debt. By the time ill health forced Shute's resignation in June, the growth in profits had run out of steam and their divergence from cash flow became all too apparent. BM joins a long list of glamour stocks brought low by the longest recession since the 1930s. It illustrates the adage: 'If it looks too good to be true, it is too good to be true.' But if Tweedie has his way, it should be more difficult for the story to be repeated. The ASB's latest proposals will push post-acquisition restructuring costs and write-downs through the profit and loss account  - as already happens with companies sorting out their own problems.</p>

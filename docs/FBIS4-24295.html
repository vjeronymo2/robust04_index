			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Soon after news on his [Dr.  Frederick Masinde's] death was broken, FORD [Forum for the  Restoration of Democracy]-Kenya top officials called for a  judicial inquiry into the death. The party top brass, led by  the second vice chairman Professor Rashid Mzee, said they were  not satisfied with the explanation given by police about the  accident. "We therefore call for an independent judicial  inquiry to be constituted urgently," they said at a hastily  called press conference at parliament buildings last night.  They said they were dissatisfied with the police explanation  because of the urgency with which the scene of the accident was  cleaned up. They claimed blood stains were washed away from the  scene 15 minutes after the accident occurred. Professor Mzee,  who read the statement on behalf of his colleagues, said Dr.  Masinde died at 2:30 PM at Nairobi Hospital. [passage omitted]    Last night, one NATION reader who works at the Nairobi  Hospital and knew of Dr. Masinde's death, called to protest  against a news item in the Kenya Television Network (KTN) seven  o'clock news bulletin which reported that Dr. Masinde was in  "stable condition". Several senior police officers were seen  visiting the hospital at 5 PM. Officials at the Nairobi  Hospital were not available to comment and were said to be  holding a board meeting.

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Bigger rises for British boards Directors of UK-listed companies receive bigger pay rises than their counterparts in foreign-owned companies, a survey showed yesterday. Half received basic salary increases of 7.4 per cent or more, compared with a median rise of 5.2 per cent for directors of foreign-owned companies including Mobil Oil of the US and Japanese-owned Toyota. The survey by Hay Management Consultants analysed more than 11,000 senior managers and directors in 476 organisations in the 12 months to July. Inflation is now 2.2 per cent, while average increases are edging towards 3.75 per cent, the survey said. The median increase - including bonus - for UK board directors was 11.2 per cent. Mr Richard Bednarek of Hay said that while the figure seemed high, earnings per share had risen 20 per cent. He said: 'The higher bonus earnings this year are indicative of the strength of the recovery in the UK and are not unexpected at this stage of the economic cycle.' The highest-paid sectors were insurance, oil, and retail. The lowest-paid sector was engineering. Of the 227 non-executive directors surveyed, most were paid between Pounds 15,000 and Pounds 25,000 for an average of 17 days' work a year. The mid-level of pay for non-executive chairmen was Pounds 68,000 for an average of 70 days a year. This is the latest in a series of recent directors' pay surveys that has found their rises are well ahead of inflation. According to another survey City managerial salaries have risen by even greater amounts on average. Day Associates says that managerial pay in City institutions, including bonus, went up 15.2 per cent in the year to August.</p>

			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> LOYOLA CHALLENGES STRONG ARIZONA  </P> <P> The Loyola Marymount baseball team, off to a 2-1 start, will travel to Tucson  for a three-game series with the University of Arizona starting with a 2:30  p.m. game today. The teams will play at 2:30 Friday and 1 p.m. Saturday.  </P> <P> The Lions, coming off a 13-6 victory over UC Irvine on Tuesday, are led, as  expected, by All-American catcher Miah Bradbury, who had seven hits in his  first 11 at-bats, including three doubles and a home run.  </P> <P> Also off to a fast start are freshman shortstop Chris Gomez, hitting a  team-high .667, and outfielder Rick Mediavilla, a junior-college transfer  hitting .455 and leading the Lions in steals and runs scored. Junior Chris  Spears has picked up both Loyola victories in relief. Arizona is rated 22nd and  24th nationally in preseason polls. ALAN DROOZ  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party] and </F> FIDESZ [Federation of Young Democrats] in Close Contest --  Political Sympathies at the End of the Year"]    [Text] From the data of public opinion polls, it is  impossible to directly deduce the expected results at the  elections, however, the results are usually also assessed from  this point of view.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Party Sympathies                                                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Name                                  |Result (Percent)                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP)      |30                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Federation of Young Democrats (FIDESZ)|22                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ)    |14                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF)      |12                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Christian Democratic People's Party (-|8                                     |  |KDNP)                                 |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Independent Smallholders Party (FKGP) |8                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Other Party                           |8                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Sample size: 936 people                                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Table I shows the order of parties among those people who  said that they would definitely vote at elections "this Sunday"  and who revealed which party they would vote for. As is shown,  the MSZP, due to its stable and active voting base, is leading  the list almost 10 percent ahead of the FIDESZ, whose voting  base mainly consists of uncertain voters, and as a result of the  events in the past few months, the stable voters and the  representatives of this stratum are also turning away from the  FIDESZ. The SZDSZ and the MDF are only following these two  parties on the third and fourth place after a big gap.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Parties Definitely Not To Be Chosen, December 1993                           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Name                                  |Result (Percent)                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |MSZP                                  |7                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |FIDESZ                                |3                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |SZDSZ                                 |1                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |MDF                                   |20                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |KDNP                                  |2                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |FKGP                                  |14                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Other Party                           |16                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Would Not Vote                        |34                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      From time to time, we also show the antagonistic feelings  against the parties, when people "definitely would not choose" a  particular party (Table II). A significant change has taken  place in this respect in the last month. The MDF, that has been  slowly but surely rising on this list during the year to above  30 percent, has now started to move downwards: It suddenly  changed its position from the 29 percent in November to 20  percent.    On the other hand, the MSZP that has been showing a very  positive result -- some 3 percent -- for a long time can now  claim a 7 percent level of dislike.    During the surveys, we also usually ask which party is  likely  to win at the parliamentary elections in the spring. Compared  to November, there has not been any change in the order, the  MSZP (20 percent) is continuing to lead with a considerable  advantage, and it is followed by the FIDESZ (13 percent) and the  SZDSZ (10 percent). However, the results of these three parties  have decreased by 1 or 2 percent, and the percentage of those  people who predict the MDF's victory, and of those who cannot  answer the question, increased to the same extent. Considering  that these changes are small and cannot yet be seen as trends,  serious conclusions cannot be drawn from them.    The death of [former Prime Minister] Jozsef Antall coincided  with our survey (we questioned 40 percent of the people before  and 60 percent after this event). We cannot avoid asking if the  death of the prime minister affected the party sympathies, and  in what way.    According to our results, the fact that views on the MDF  (and  to a lesser extent, its coalition partners) changed is certainly  closely related to Antall's death.    Up to 12 December, 5 percent (of all the surveyed people)  would have voted on the MDF, and this changed to 8 percent  afterwards. In the case of the KDNP and the FKGP, there is a 2  to 3 percent decrease between these two periods.    On the scale of dislikes, the MDF had 24 percent before 12  December and only 18 percent after this. The level of dislike  of the FKGP increased by some 3 percent between the two periods.    On the list of parties that would be elected to Parliament,  in the two periods, the MDF had 6 and 12 percent respectively,  while the already low results of its coalition partners  decreased by another 2 to 3 percent.    According to the survey, the results of the opposition  parties did not change after the death of the prime minister.  Therefore, we can conclude that the MDF increased its strength  to the detriment of the other coalition parties, rather than  that of the opposition parties. However, we will only be able  to draw trends after assessing the party preferences in the  coming months.</p>

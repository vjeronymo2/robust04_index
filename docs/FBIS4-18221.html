			<p>BFN     [Text] Nuremberg (DDP/ADN) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel has voiced skepticism about the CDU/CSU [Christian  Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] call for easier  deportation to Turkey of Kurds who have committed offenses in  Germany. I would advise "extreme caution" on the matter, Kinkel  told journalists in Nuremberg today. There must be no  deportation of Kurds threatened with human rights violations in  Turkey.    In spite of his reservations, he is prepared to consider  changes to legislation in cases where the right to hospitality  has been abused, Kinkel added. Nor would he tire of urging the  Turkish Government, "in the spirit of friendship," to prevent  human rights violations in Turkey. The European Union and  Germany should spell out to its NATO partner, Turkey, "what we  expect of it."    Kinkel announced he wants to learn the truth about reports  stating that German weapons are being used against the Kurds in  Turkey. However, so far he has received no evidence of this  despite intensive enquiries. If the reports are true, the  German Government will "lodge massive diplomatic protests to the  Turkish Government."</p>

There was no immediate report of any casualties, the  official said. Thai army and police at the border were placed  on alert, he said.    The clash took place at Phoum Mahan, Phoum Malai and Dongsua  Tai, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of Poipet, a Cambodian  town on the other side of the border from Aranyaprathet, the  official said. The incident was reported a day after Phnom Penh  announced that it had launched a 2,000-troop assault on the  Khmer Rouge's headquarters at Anlong Veng, on the northern  Cambodian border with Thailand, about 180 kilometers (110 miles)  northeast of Poipet.    The Khmer Rouge, blamed for the death of at least a million  Cambodians during the 1970s, boycotted the U.N.-sponsored  elections in Cambodia last year that saw the country become a  constitutional monarchy under King Norodom Sihanouk.    The government has stepped up military pressure on the  ultra-nationalist faction while at the same time promoting a  peace initiative with it.</p>

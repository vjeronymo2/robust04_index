			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Two men forced their way into a Black Angus Restaurant Saturday morning, taking  an undetermined amount of cash and locking employees inside a food freezer.  </P> <P> San Diego police said the two men confronted an employee at 8:41 a.m. as he  arrived for work at the restaurant at 10370 Friars Road.  </P> <P> The men, both wearing dark sunglasses and baseball caps, forced their way into  the restaurant as the employee opened the door and locked the employees in a  room, said Sgt. Fred England. Employees told police one of the suspects had a  scraggly beard and carried a sawed-off rifle or shotgun and appeared to be in  his 30s. The other was clean shaven and looked to be in his 20s.  </P> <P> The men took money from the restaurant's accountant working in the manager's  office and then placed all six employees into the restaurant's food freezer.  The employees forced the freezer lock open about 20 minutes after the suspects  fled. No shots were fired and no one was injured.  </P></p>

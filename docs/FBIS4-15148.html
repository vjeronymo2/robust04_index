			<p>BFN     [Text] Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov held a news  conference today devoted to the latest events in Crimea's  political and economic life. He negatively commented on the  introduction of the office of the Ukrainian president's  representative in Crimea, describing this step as a political  provocation aimed at hindering the second round of elections for  the Crimean Supreme Council. Regarding presidential  representative Valeriy Horbatov, Yuriy Meshkov said in a  televised interview yesterday that Crimean interests are  Horbatov's least concern, and that a honest man who cherishes  these interests will not shake his hand. At the news  conference, Meshkov added that the Republic of Crimea has lost  one of its citizens. In a sharp and even offensive tone,  Meshkov spoke of the Ukrainian leadership which, in his opinion,  prevents the Crimea from dealing with its economy, provokes  confrontation, and creates tensions on the peninsula. The  presence of military subunits saturated -- as he put it -- with  nationalistic spirit not only does not guarantee Crimean  security, but also threatens it.    Many questions from journalists concerned relations between  Yuriy Meshkov and Crimean Deputy Prime Minister Yevhen Saburov.  Meshkov stated that he corrected Saburov's mistakes by issuing  another decree. Effective today, the previous low prices for  bread are reinstated in the Crimea. The Crimean president does  not share the concern that Saburov might be dismissed, which is  being voiced behind the scenes.</p>

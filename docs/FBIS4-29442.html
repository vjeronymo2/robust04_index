			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] The rejection of the East Asia Economic Caucus,  EAEC, by the United States comes as no surprise. Since it was  mooted by Malaysia more than three years ago, the U.S. has  firmly said no to the idea. However, what is most discouraging  is that the reason for its opposition to the caucus did not hold  water. America thinks that it will have a negative effect on  the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, APEC. It is difficult to  accept such an explanation.    The EAEC has been proposed as a forum to propagate the free  trade. Rather than posing any obstacle, it will complement  APEC. As such, there is no basis to the claim. APEC was formed  to sustain the growth and dynamism of the Asia-Pacific region.  However, East Asian economies have evolved in a somewhat  different manner. Their economies unlike that of the U.S. have  become a success story. Therefore, the promotion of the EAEC is  a natural step forward in view of the rapid pace of economic  integration in the region. What is more remarkable is that the  integration has been driven by market forces. In the process  and without doubt, East Asia has become an important economic  entity in the global scenario. As a mere consultative forum,  the EAEC will provide a platform for these countries to discuss  trade and other issues of common interests.    It is clear that from the very beginning, the U.S. was  annoyed with the idea since it was left out. But, the U.S. is  not part of East Asia. How can they be part of the EAEC.  Nevertheless, the EAEC, which has now progressed into an ASEAN  proposal, should look forward to its formation. Enough time has  been spent on debating the pros and cons of the caucus. The  time has come for the EAEC to get off the ground with ASEAN  countries as the core members.    Of course, there are concerns that Japan may be reluctant to  join up now that the U.S. has rejected the idea. But this  should not be the case. As a major economic superpower in the  region, Japan's membership will have a tremendous impact in  enhancing the structure of the EAEC. At the same time, Japan  has to realize that there is also much economic dynamism in the  other potential members. They include emerging China, South  Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. Therefore, Japan should consider  the benefits of an EAEC comprising the most dynamic economies of  the world. No less important is the immense combined market  opportunities these countries will offer. Another vital role is  that it could provide the platform for member countries to act  as a single unit in holding out the cause and principles of free  trade in international trade negotiations.    It is clearly evident that the Western powers dominate  issues  and decisions in international trade talks. Moves to  institutionalize APEC are an example of how strong countries  dominate others. This should not be the case any longer. As  successful economies, East Asian countries need to have a  stronger voice in the international arena so that any decision  arrived at is equitable to all. This being the case, the speedy  establishment of the EAEC is highly justified. This is no time  for listening to both the skeptics and the critics. It is time  to act.</p>

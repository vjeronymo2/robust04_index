			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> OAKLAND;  </P> <P> PIT BULL GIVEN UP, MAIL IS RESTORED  </P> <P> The U.S. Postal Service plans to seek damages from the owner of a pit bull  described as "a canine crocodile" that attacked a mail carrier. Postal  spokesman Dan Demiglio said that because the dog's owner, identified by humane  officers as Carlos Jackson, turned the dog in, mail will again be delivered to  the two-block area near Mills College.  </P> <P> Mail deliveries to the neighborhood stopped after the attack on carrier Cecil  Ivey. Demiglio had warned after the attack that mail would be withheld until  the dog was taken out of circulation. A neighborhood resident, Shirley Bryant,  said the dog was well known and feared in the area. The muscular pit bull  seized Ivey, 45, by the lower right arm during his rounds, inflicting what a  hospital spokesman called serious wounds.  </P></p>

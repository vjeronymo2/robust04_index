Musa described the summit between U.S. President Bill  Clinton and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad as a new sign in the  peace process, noting that the summit was successful by any  standard. Musa referred to the telephone call between  Presidents Clinton and Mubarak on the issue. He reviewed the  impact of the summit on relations between Syria and the United  States and on the Lebanese-Israeli peace talks, adding that this  could lead to a just peace on the basis of land for peace. The  foreign minister's report referred to the Palestinian-Israeli  track and the results reached by the two sides during their  ongoing meetings regarding the implementation of the  Gaza-Jericho agreement. The report also referred to the  agreement between Jordan and the PLO.    Musa noted that there is an Egyptian-Palestinian draft  agreement to set up joint projects and open branches of Egyptian  banks in Gaza and Jericho. He pointed out that the draft  agreement is expected to be signed in Cairo soon.    Turning to the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the foreign  minister referred to the partition plan and the position of the  parties to the conflict on this plan. He noted that NATO is  ready to use force to implement the partition agreement under  the supervision of the Security Council. [passage omitted]    The Cabinet then reviewed a report by Interior Minister  Hasan  al- Alfi in which he discussed the internal security situation  and the Interior Ministry's efforts on this matter. Al-Alfi  pointed out that the ministry is following a plan based on a  clear-cut security strategy. Noting that confronting extremism  remains a key security element, the interior minister pointed  out that improved methods have been recently introduced. More  extensive security operations against dens of extremism have  been mounted, particularly in shantytowns, Upper Egypt, and some  other governorates. Coordination between state security and  public security agencies has been stepped up to pursue and  swiftly arrest fugitives.    The minister noted that the list of suspects at airports,  ports, and other points of entry and exit has been widened and  extra measures have been taken to confront leading extremists  with a view to isolating them and cutting off their contacts  with their cadres. In addition, any signs of agitation or  escalation by extremists are being dealt with firmly and their  schemes among the masses are being frustrated. The minister  pointed out that plans by the military wing of the terrorist  organizations have been aborted, their influential leaders have  been arrested, and their dens stormed. He noted that his  ministry is confronting some signs of corruption and deviation  as part of the government's policy and in a bid to demonstrate  the integrity of the regime.    The interior minister pointed out that security cooperation  with some Arab countries in the areas of coordination and  handing over fugitives is being upgraded. He reviewed his  contacts during the Arab interior ministers' meeting in Tunis,  adding that they have led to the arrest of some fugitives. He  referred to the decline in the rate of seizure of unlicensed  weapons, cases of drug trafficking, embezzlement, squandering of  public wealth, and bribery.    During the meeting, the Cabinet approved a number of draft  laws, including one regulating the use of foreign currency. The  new bill lifts the current restrictions and procedures that are  no longer compatible with the free exchange regulations in Egypt  and allows travelers to take out foreign currency without any  restrictions or documents. The Cabinet also approved a draft  law organizing the cotton trade in the country. The bill seeks  to liberalize the sale and purchase of cotton in accordance with  the market economy and the principle of free trade.    The Cabinet also approved a draft law setting up a Cotton  Exchange for spot transactions to be called the Mina al-Basal  Exchange. Cotton will be sold and purchased through this  exchange, which will be based in Alexandria. The Cabinet also  approved a draft civil code that will remedy the loopholes that  exist in the current law. Under the new law, automation will be  introduced to prevent the forgery of identity cards and all  relevant information for each citizen will be stored and given a  computerized number. The Cabinet also approved a number of  international agreements.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Doreen Cheung in Beijing] </F>   [Text] China made clear yesterday it would follow the  advice of its preparatory panel for the post-1997 government and  ask all civil servants to indicate whether they would remain in  the Government after 1997.    The comment, from the Foreign Ministry, came despite  reservations in Hong Kong about the proposal from the  Preliminary Working Committee (PWC).    Ministry spokesman Wu Jianfan also confirmed Britain would  be  denied a say in choosing the leadership of the first Special  Administrative Region (SAR) government.    "It is clear that the right to nominate and appoint the  principal officials of the Hong Kong SAR government rests with  the SAR chief executive and the central Government,  respectively, rather than a case in which the candidates for  principal officials will be nominated by the British side and  then submitted for consultation with the Chinese side," Mr Wu  said.    He called on civil servants to put their hearts at ease,  saying China would abide by the Joint Declaration and the Basic  Law.    "The Chinese side sincerely hopes that the civil servants  working in the various departments of the Hong Kong Government  will rest assured and perform their duties, and will continue to  render service for the Hong Kong SAR government and for the Hong  Kong people after 1997," the spokesman said.    But in Hong Kong, the Deputy to the Governor, Anson Chan  Fang  On- sang, said civil servants did not need to declare whether  they wanted to stay beyond 1997: She said both the Joint  Declaration and the Basic Law made clear that civil servants  could expect to remain in the service after 1997.    Mrs Chan said the Government stood ready "at any time" to  discuss civil service matters with China and hoped the  discussions would take place "sooner rather than later".    Secretary for Constitutional Affairs, Michael Sze  Cho-cheung,  said that if China chose not to discuss a "through-train" for  the civil service, the Government could not force Beijing to do  so.    However, he said the Government would not give up persuading  China to enter into talks simply because of the statement by the  Foreign Ministry.    "Consultation on the subject must be in the interest of Hong  Kong," he said.    "Just as when we consult them, we don't necessarily have to  accept their view. The final say rests with us. By the same  token, the boot is on their foot. Even if they discuss with us,  they don't have to accept what we say."    Notwithstanding the Foreign Ministry's statement, Mr Sze  said  his plan for preparing the new senior-level line-up would go  ahead.    "If there is a vacancy, I will still have to fill the post.  We will do our best to find the best person for the job," he  said.</p>

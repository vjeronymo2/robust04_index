			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Nasa may have to cut 5,000 space shuttle jobs THE US may be forced to cut 5,000 jobs from its space shuttle programme, according to Mr Robert Crippen, director of the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) has promised to cut 15 per cent over the next five years from the Dollars 2.7bn (Pounds 1.5bn) annual costs of its shuttle programme, which accounts for nearly 20 per cent of its overall budget. That would mean a reduction of about 5,000 jobs, although some staff might be shifted to other programmes. Vice President Dan Quayle, who chairs the National Space Council, announced last summer that the US would build no new shuttles, concentrating instead on developing a new generation of launch rockets. Nasa said yesterday the more money the agency could free from the shuttle programme, the more it would have for costly programmes such as the space station. Assembly of the space station, whose cost is now estimated at Dollars 40bn, is due to start in late 1995, while the first platform of the Earth Observing System is due to be launched in 1997.</p>

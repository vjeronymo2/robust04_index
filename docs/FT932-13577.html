			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Prices continued to follow the easier tendency apparent before the Easter recess in the Australian selling, when sales were resumed in Melbourne and Brisbane this week. China was a prominent buyer but overall demand remained insufficient to match offerings. Stockpile sales have for many weeks been entirely negligible in market significance and the emphasis is on over production of wool with no early indication of a better balance, unless it is for a brief market upturn reacting to such an exceptionally long downward trend. The AWC market indicator was at another new low point of 401 cents a kg on April 21.</p>

			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MONTANA BEATS CLOCK, BUCCANEERS  </P> <P> Joe Montana didn't enjoy himself, until it was over.  </P> <P> Montana, who struggled for most of the game, ran four yards for a touchdown  with 40 seconds left Sunday to give the San Francisco 49ers a 20-16 victory  over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  </P> <P> "It was not fun to play that way, and it wasn't fun to have to come back from  behind," Montana said. "But a lot of us have been in those situations before  and we didn't get rattled."  </P> <P> Vinny Testaverde gave the Buccaneers (1-1) a 16-13 lead with an 18-yard scoring  pass to Mark Carrier with 3 1/2 minutes left, but that is too much time to give  Montana with the game on the line.  </P> <P> The final scoring drive featured completions of 15 yards to John Taylor and Tom  Rathman as well as an 11-yarder to Jerry Rice, whose two-yard touchdown catch  gave San Francisco (2-0) a 13-9 lead with 8:31 left.  </P> <P> "They are a team that's done it so many times," Testaverde said of the 49ers'  decisive 10-play, 70-yard drive. "It was a sick feeling watching them do it  live."  </P> <P> Montana and the 49ers' offense didn't get on track until after Tampa Bay went  ahead, 9-6, on Donald Igwebuike's third field goal of the game.  </P> <P> Montana completed four of seven passes for 53 yards on the game-winning drive.  He rolled around right end for his touchdown two plays after a holding penalty  on Tampa Bay's Donnie Elder nullified a third-down incompletion that would have  forced the 49ers to try for a game-tying field goal.  </P> <P> Montana finished with 25 completions in 39 attempts for 266 yards, one  touchdown and two interceptions. Rice had eight receptions for 122 yards.  </P> <P> Testaverde, coming off the best game of his brief career in Tampa Bay's  season-opening victory over Green Bay, minimized errors for the second straight  week with a short passing game.  </P> <P> He completed 14 of 35 for 146 yards and a touchdown with two interceptions,  both by Ronnie Lott. However, both came on desperation throws, on the last play  of the first half and the last play of the game.  </P></p>

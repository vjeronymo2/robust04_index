			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [ITIM Report] </F>   [Text] Shots were fired in the early evening yesterday at  an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] outpost in Rafah's Tall Sultan  neighborhood, but did not cause either casualties or damage.  The soldiers returned fire.    The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine took  responsibility for the attempted attack and claimed that several  soldiers were wounded. But, to repeat, there were no casualties.    A Fatah Hawks leaflet disseminated yesterday in the Gaza  Strip called for an end to use of arms when nonessential. The  leaflet threatened to confiscate the weapons and punish the  perpetrators.    The cases referred to are shots fired during festivities and  taking money from residents under threat of arms while  pretending to belong to Fatah or other organizations. During  festivities marking Fatah's establishment 10 days ago wanted men  and residents fired in the air out of happiness. At least five  armed terrorists were later arrested and all were freed after  senior IDF [Israel Defense Forces] officers intervened.    Arab sources note that groups of criminals are roaming  around  pretending to be wanted men and are demanding "taxes" from  shopkeepers and wealthy people in the Strip. In some cases,  wanted men are also making a living that way.</p>

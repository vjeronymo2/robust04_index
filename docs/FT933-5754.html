			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (19): Dancing with the dead at the Starlight - Journey to the heart of an anguished continent / Nicholas Woodsworth travels from Bagamoyo, once the terminus of a busy slave trading route, to the Great Lakes - retracing the paths trodden by those in bondage in the 18th and 19th centuries THERE is not much left of Bagamoyo these days. It has become once again what it was in the beginning, a somnolent backwater lost on a low coast at the end of a bad road. Campaign charts of a lost battle, maps of mould and lichen grow large on the walls of imperial buildings in ruin. Wooden stick ribs protrude from the sides of crumbling mud huts. Green bush and tropical lethargy encroach everywhere. Even chickens peck languidly in Bagamoyo. On the afternoon I arrived, the place hardly looked like a signpost pointing the way to the heart of Africa. But time, aided by heat, humidity and termites, has simply covered over the traces of the past. Once Bagamoyo was the terminus of a busy Arab slave trading route stretching 700 miles into the interior. 'Lay down your heart' is the Swahili meaning of the word Bagamoyo, and in the phrase lies millions of men's, an entire continent's, anguish. But Bagamoyo did not only export African tragedy to the rest of the world; it was also the conduit that brought the rest of the world, and many of its tragedies, to Africa. In the mid-1800s Richard Burton, John Speke, Henry Stanley, James Grant, all celebrities of the Victorian age, passed through here, using age-old slave routes to rediscover and remake a continent. Near the beach at Bagamoyo, over the door of a small weather-beaten church, is nailed a sign honouring the passage of that greatest of explorers, David Livingstone. 'I beg to direct your attention to Africa,' Livingstone addressed Cambridge University in 1857. 'I know that in a few years I shall be cut off in that country, which is now open. Do not let it be shut again] I go back to Africa to try to make an open path for commerce and Christianity; do you carry out the work which I have begun.' We have, in a manner of speaking, carried out that work. Within a few years Livingstone's penetration of Africa had become the rape of Africa. The continent was transformed not by idealism, but by the steam engine, quinine and the Maxim gun. Its own evolutionary patterns shattered, Africa was co-opted into an imperfect imitation of a world that over-rode it. Like a fastidious gentleman with desires satisfied and composure regained, the world a century and a half on seems reluctant to continue the relationship or consider too deeply the results. War, famine, debt, disease, corruption, over-population, mismanagement, social breakdown and a hundred other illnesses taint and exhaust the former object of its attentions. Bagamoyo slumbers, a symbol of a pathway once open but now, as Livingstone feared, at risk of closing down. The 'dark continent', once a romantic mystery that demanded investigation, may finally become a reality no one wants to know about. Bagamoyo is as good a place as any to contemplate its future. Dar es Salaam I was not able, as I had intended, to catch the train that leaves from Dar es Salaam and snakes slowly westwards across 700 miles of stunted, dusty bush. One hundred and fifty years ago this was the route that led towards central Africa and that holiest of Victorian grails, the source of the Nile. Today the route remains almost as haphazard, and few overland travel itineraries work out as planned. I had to abandon the wheezing Peugeot bush taxi I had hired for the bumpy trip from Bagamoyo to Dar, leaving it immobilised in a cloud of radiator steam. I had to abandon too the patched-up bus that followed some time later, leaving it raised forlornly on jacks. Can high-tech save the continent? A blond Scandinavian in a shiny new aid agency Landcruiser saved me, but me alone. I left my fellow bus passengers by the dusty roadside, waiting, as all Africa sometimes seems to wait, for something to come along. But not even imported technology allowed me to make my train - it had left an hour before I finally reached Dar. Could I catch a fast bus and meet the train at an onward station? It was not that easy. Tanzania's roads are atrocious, so badly maintained they strangle the economy and so dangerous that public buses are prohibited from using them at night. I used what only the privileged can use to make life work in Africa - money. For Pounds 18 - six weeks wages for a Tanzanian civil servant - I had a privately hired, 26-seater bus rush me, its solitary passenger, 125 miles through the darkness to the next train stop at Morogoro. With a little money in Africa even mediocre men can become special men. It is what many whites have always enjoyed. Morogoro Like the roadside villages I passed through that evening, the Morogoro railway station at midnight was inky black, its platform a dark void pin-pricked here and there by the flickering flames of kerosene lamps. Drought here means more than parched fields; with hydro turbines silent, it also means little power or electric light. What does one do when the conveniences of modern life fail, when systems break down, reserves are exhausted, ambitious plans come to nothing? In this part of the world there is often little alternative - people simply bear with it. In the dark I picked my way over a platform thick with sleeping bodies bundled in blankets and as still as corpses, and settled down. What does one do when finally opportunity presents itself? On a continent where people are many and services few, one scrambles. When the train finally pulled in the corpses sprang to life, bellowing and bumping blindly in the night, everyone trying to get bags and bundles through doors and windows before everyone else. The carriages may be over-crowded, the conductors bullying, the toilets smelly, the dining car less than epicurean, but when the choice is one of poor service or no service at all, there is little dickering. Tabora Eighteen hours and some 400 miles later, the train passed through Tabora and I got off. In their search for the Nile, Stanley, Livingstone, Burton and Speke all found rest and uncertain hospitality here. From the 1820s Tabora flourished as an Arab town, an inland centre for the depredations of expatriate traders. Slavery aside, things have not changed greatly today. On Tabora's dusty streets I met Pyara Sokhi, a Sikh entrepreneur who has broken with the town's small but powerful Asian community. Over a feast of curry in celebration of Guru Nanak's birthday, Sokhi told me of his fears for Tabora's future. In a vast, impoverished region where Arab, and now Indian, interests maintain a firm grip on commerce, an African-run economy has failed to get off the ground. Tanzania's new free market has made wealthier those who were already wealthy. African Tabora is foundering. I had thought that putting up for three days with the mud-brown water and wriggling insect larvae that dribbled out of the tap in Tabora's dilapidated Railway Hotel bad enough. I was not prepared for the depressing year-in, year-out reality that Pyara Sokhi introduced me to. At the Tabora Boys' Secondary School, once an educational showpiece, I watched Danish aid workers fit new plumbing into old buildings. There is so little public money for education that Danida has had to undertake the refurbishment and maintenance of public schools throughout the country. Julius Nyerere, the architect of Tanzanian socialism, boarded and studied in this school 45 years ago; today, his experiment in tatters, he would find there are not even enough desks or beds to go round. In the town library most books date from the 1960s. Computers are merely a rumour. In Tabora's Kitete Hospital, the largest in a region of 18m people, a shortage of Tanzanian staff has been bridged only by the voluntary services of an eight-man medical team from China. The medicines are Chinese, as are the operating theatre and technical equipment. Patients double up in beds. There is no blood bank, no dependable electrical supply, and the water that comes from the taps, when it comes at all, is the same mud-brown. I watched a young child dying from third degee burns. Somewhere in the post, a doctor told me, a grafting scalpel was on its way from China; it might or might not arrive in time. Chomachankola In 1858 John Speke, the Victorian explorer of the Nile's source, swung north from Tabora and crossed a burning and inhospitable plain to the green shores of Lake Victoria. I did too, hitching a ride with Phil Riddell, a United Nations irrigation specialist. Bright and energetic, Riddell is typical of the best of a new generation of expatriate specialists on the continent. Since the first aid efforts of the 1960s lessons have been learned and plans scaled down to better suit Africa's abilities to make them work. Riddell remains enthusiastic about his work; Africa is vital, he believes, to the world's long-term food strategies. But as we bounced along a dirt track towards a new irrigation project at the village of Chomachankola, he acknowledged that he wrestles, often unsuccessfully, with problems spared much of the rest of the world. Riddell has worked in Asia, where technology and foreign aid has been grafted to firmly established productive systems. He is also familiar with the Middle East, where new systems have been tailor-made in technologically virgin territory. Africa, he says, is more difficult than either. Here local technology is not sophisticated. But in the past at least, he said, it was substantial and assured survival. Now, because of population pressures, environmental change, domestic political policies and global economics, old techniques are no longer viable. They are also difficult to adapt. Technology is inseparable from the history of the people who use it; on a continent forcibly prised from its past, it has no firm base to build on. Great problems are made up of a series of little problems. At Chomachankola, Riddell was happy with progress being made on the low-tech, gravity-fed irrigation project there. But when I last saw him at Mwanza on Lake Victoria a few hours later he had forgotten the dream of global food supply; he was back at the cutting edge, arguing with a drunken port official, who for a bribe had sold his reserved car space on a ferry west to the next aid project. There is a more crucial factor to to aid than technology, Riddell admitted. It is the human factor. I boarded my own ferry north to Uganda. Kampala I enjoyed dancing with the bar girls of the Starlight Nightclub. They are vivacious - full of energy and the sensual enjoyment of music and movement. But they also made me sad. They are survivors in a decimated country. What Idi Amin began, Aids has continued. Soon, many of them too shall be gone. I tried not to think that evening that I was dancing with the dead. But Kampala is an African city that shows one of Africa's greatest attributes - resilience. Here everyone is a survivor of not just Aids, but of two decades of violence and megalomaniacal government. Yet Ugandans show a will to rebuild their lives. The streets of Kampala may still be down-at-heel and battle-scarred, but the crowds that throng them have an insuppressible vitality and lack of rancour. In the Nakasero market I bought a souvenir made from throw-away bits of western technology. It is a small lamp made of an inverted light bulb fitted with a wick and mounted on the lid of a Danish butter tin. Filled with kerosene, such lamps bring light to a country where 90 per cent of homes are without power. It is a simple re-application of means to needs. For me it is a symbol, full of hope, of Africa's capacity to find ways out of disaster. Jinja By kamikaze-piloted mini-bus, the town of Jinja lies a hair-raising two hours from Kampala along the shores of Lake Victoria. For me it was the end of a 10-day journey; for the Nile it is the beginning of a 2,000-mile trip that ends in the Mediterranean. Jinja lies in lush countryside amid rolling fields of coffee, maize, tea, and bananas. It is a place of such beauty and fertility that it is hard to believe things could ever go far wrong. Certainly, when he first walked here beside the turbulent and fast-flowing Nile Speke could not have imagined how far wrong the African future could go. Nor could the prosperous Asian community that until the 1970s made this a prosperous industrial centre. For 20 years Jinja has been a decaying town, its foreigners expelled, its factories expropriated, its once-sumptuous villas and mansions run to ruin by the poor families that camp out in them. It is a place that might have gone the way of Bagamoyo. But Jinja is slowly coming alive again. Former non-indigenous owners and businesses are trickling back, encouraged by a government that now believes the benefits of foreign involvement outweigh the disadvantages. Do they? From the point of view of most westerners there would seem to be little gain. Even 10 days of casual travel makes Africa appear to be a continent adrift, its problems intractable, its potential unrealisable. How must it look to the foreign banker, businessman, or diplomat? A century ago the Victorians found that African exploration raised more questions than it answered. Today we are explorers of new African frontiers, and the answers are even harder to come by. Is a revival like Jinja's, fairer and more equitable to African interests, realistically possible? Is the continent doomed to become one vast Bagamoyo? Our idealism has been much tempered since Livingstone first directed our attention to Africa. A short journey here makes his warning seem now almost too late. But perhaps not - Africa is inextricably involved with the rest of the world. What began long ago with Arab traders continues today with Chinese doctors, Indian businessmen, Norwegian aid workers, British engineers. Once discovered, Africa will not go away.</p>

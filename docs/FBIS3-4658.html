The indictment, citing detailed materials, roundly exposes  the fact that he has resorted to flunkeyist treacheries, fascist  dictatorship, schemes to perpetuate the division of the country  and war moves in a more crafty and vicious way than the  preceding military fascist dictators in last one year after he  came to power under the "civilian" mask.    According to the indictment, it is one of the blackest  crimes  he committed during the year that he has impaired and sold off  the interests of the country and the nation, persistently  pursuing the flunkeyist and treacherous policy.    In his "inaugural address" he said that no allies "can be  better than the nation." No sooner had he held all the strings  of power, however, than he left South Korea lock, stock and  barrel as an aggressive military base of the United States,  opened the domestic rice market to the United States and turned  South Korea into a market of Japanese goods.    Worse still, he invited Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa to Seoul in November last year and told him that the  issue of "comfort women for the army" and other monstrous crimes  committed by the Japanese imperialists against the Korean people  in the past should be buried in oblivion and South Korea and  Japan should develop new "relations" and flung open the door to  Japan for its economic comeback to South Korea.    Since he took office, the traitor has stooped to any infamy  in his efforts to "isolate and reject" the North in the  international arena, rehearsing the rumor about "the North's  nuclear arms development" spread by the imperialist  reactionaries.    Another blackest crime of the Kim Yong-sam group is that it  has harshly suppressed the just, patriotic struggle of the South  Korean students and people for independence, democracy and  reunification, reducing South Korea to a theatre of fascist  rowdyism, a waste land of the nation and a graveyard of human  rights.    The group has kept intact all the legal and institutional  mechanisms such as the "National Security Law," the "Security  Planning Board" and the "secret affairs command," which the  preceding military fascist regimes regarded as the foundations  for their existence. It has bloodily suppressed the struggle of  the South Korean people by dint of them.    By October last year the fascist clique had imprisoned more  than 200 students and intellectuals by invoking the "National  Security Law." This number is 2.5 times that in the  corresponding months of the early period of the power of the No  Tae-u puppet clique.    Entering this year, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique's  suppression has become all the more outrageous.    In early February when peasants and students demonstrated to  protect the farm market, the puppet clique brutally suppressed  them with the mobilization of more than 15,000-strong riot  police of 130 companies and arrested no fewer than 400 of them,  branding their patriotic struggle as "violence."    The traitor Kim Yong-sam is a thorough-paced  anti-reunification element who has driven the North-South  relations from bad to worse and opposed peaceful reunification  of the country.    Even after he received the 10-point programme of the great  unity of the whole nation sent by the North, he, turning down  the magnanimous proposal of the North for reconciliation and  unity, has totally frozen inter-Korean high-level talks and  foiled the exchange of special envoys between the North and the  South. He also perpetrated such inhuman and anti-reunification  criminal acts as blocking the Seoul trip of a mourners' group of  the North to participate in the funeral of the Rev. Mun Ik-hwan  in January and not allowing a Panmunjom contact between  delegates of the chondoists of the North and the South for the  joint commemoration of the centenary of the peasants' war in  1894.    The anti-reunification nature of the traitor was graphically  illustrated by the fact that he brought forward a "three-stage  unification formula" based on "institutional unification" which  may foster confrontation and spark off a war between the fellow  countrymen, motivated by the "concept of uselessness of  unification" the keypoint of which is that "unification which  fails to ensure liberal democracy and market economy is no  better than division."    It is an intolerable high treason that after taking power,  the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has zealously schemed to provoke  a war against the fellow countrymen in the North, following  outside forces.    From the beginning of the year, the puppet clique has staged  war exercises with the United States against the North,  increasing military tension. It openly stated that if the "Team  Spirit" nuclear war exercises were suspended this year, joint  military manoeuvres equivalent to them in scale would be staged  in August.    Getting off into war hysterics, the Kim Yong-sam group has  brought into South Korea various types of military equipment  including ground-to-ground missiles and fighter planes of next  generation by increasing military expenditures. It has also put  spurs on nuclear arms development, openly claiming that "nuclear  right must be secured." In actuality, such comprador  enterprises of South Korea as the Chang Won Machines, the  Nuclear Fuel Corporation, Ltd. the nuclear fuel plastic  processing factory and the Atomic Energy Technology Corporation,  Ltd. have separately manufactured in secrecy accessories and  materials necessary for nuclear bombs, labelled as ordinary  goods or with ciphers.    The facts clearly show that with the traitor Kim Yong-sam  wearing the "civilian" veil left intact, neither national  reconciliation and unity, nor the reunification in the '90s  which the whole nation eagerly hopes for, nor the independence  and democratization of the South Korean society can be achieved  and only the confrontation will be fostered and war caused  between the fellow countrymen.</p>

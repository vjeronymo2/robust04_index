			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Clinton may link aid to stimulus bill THE Clinton administration may try to tie its plans for Russian aid into a package with some of its domestic stimulus proposals in an attempt to win backing in Congress for both. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary, acknowledged yesterday that the Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.03bn) the US offered President Boris Yeltsin at the Vancouver summit was already funded. But it would be hard to win congressional approval for the further Dollars 1.8bn in bilateral aid it promised at the Group of Seven meeting in Tokyo this month. 'That is a concern for us. It seems to me it has to be part of another try at the stimulus package,' he said yesterday. President Bill Clinton had to abandon his stimulus package, which contained Dollars 16bn of spending on urban, infrastructure and educational projects intended to give a short-term boost to the economy, in the face of a Republican filibuster in the Senate. Unlike the stimulus bill, the Russian aid proposals have the support of many in the Republican leadership, so there is no threat of another filibuster. But some of Mr Clinton's fellow Democrats in Congress, especially in the House of Representatives, are now saying that if there is to be no help for US inner cities, then they will not vote help for Russia. Even Democrats convinced of the strategic importance of aiding Russia are reluctant to do so, especially as they doubt whether the Republican rank-and-file will share their leaders' desire to be statesmanlike on the issue. Mr Bentsen said no decision had yet been made on what precise mixture of Russian aid and stimulus proposals should be included in a revised bill. He said, however, that there would be an effort to bring the Republican opposition on board at an early stage, and indicated that he himself would play a leading role in building support for the measures in Congress. 'I think there will be attempts and approaches to make this bipartisan, and I hope we are successful in that regard,' he said. Leading congressional Democrats, however, have said this week that they want to include Russian aid in a general foreign aid bill, rather than moving it as separate legislation.</p>

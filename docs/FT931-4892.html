			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report GOLD was fixed at Dollars 327.50 a troy ounce on the London bullion market after a fixing session stretching over 40 minutes following US fund selling on Comex and to a lesser extent in London, dealers said. The fix and subsequent trading edged gold just below the Dollars 328-Dollars 330 an ounce range which had become well established in the past couple of weeks. Some analysts believe the market could now slip through the Dollars 320s if stop-loss selling continues in the absence of resolute buying. Three-month COPPER moved above Dollars 2,150 a tonne on the LME, helped by trends in New York, where sentiment has been lifted by the recent positive US employment report. Three-month ALUMINIUM moved below Dollars 1,180 a tonne, while three-month NICKEL moved above Dollars 6,000 a tonne. London COCOA edged ahead on the absence of the selling which pushed May below Pounds 700 a tonne last week. Last week's Geneva negotiations on an international agreement were already discounted.

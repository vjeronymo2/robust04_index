			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Letter: No benefit in an ad hoc union Sir, Co-ordinated by the UK's chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, the EC finance ministers last week issued a ringing affirmation of the current central parities within the exchange rate mechanism. This fixity in the teeth of such profound shocks as German monetary unification means that we now live in an ERM that is essentially an ad hoc economic and monetary union, where all national policies are determined by the Bundesbank's reactions to Chancellor Kohl's generosity on unification. This has all the disadvantages and few of the advantages of a formal single currency. Yet at Maastricht the UK government prided itself in not committing itself now to the permanent parities implied by a formal Emu, and was reluctant to trust Britain's monetary policy to a similarly unelected (yet more broadly based) European central bank. Sometimes it is hard to follow the higher consistency of the Treasury mind, which seems to have adopted as its motto: 'If it's hurting, it's working' - the logical converse of Mr Major's famous slogan.

			<p>BFN     [Text] In an INTERFAX interview today Vladimir Karpov, aide  to Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov, said that Meshkov must be  granted extra powers to carry out economic reforms and that the  president has no time to push laws through parliamentary  commissions.    Last week Meshkov called on members of parliament to adopt a  law giving legal authority to presidential decrees on matters,  which are not currently subject to Crimean legislation.    Karpov said that at the talks between Kiev and Simferopol,  at  which he was a participant, the Ukrainian side was very well  prepared while the Crimean delegates were not sufficiently  qualified. For this reason the leadership had decided to change  the composition of the delegation to include experienced lawyers  and economists.    Karpov said that the Ukrainian delegation had begun by  looking for a purely political solution to the problem.  However, at the insistence of the Crimean side, both political  and economic aspects had been considered. He added that the  Crimean side had suggested concluding a treaty on the basis of  that which exists between Russia and Tatarstan.    Karpov said that this would cause problems relating to the  Ukrainian constitution, which maintains Ukraine is a unitary  state, unlike Russia which is a federation.    He added that during the discussions both sides had agreed  that there was a need to make changes to both the Crimean and  Ukrainian constitutions.    Asked what changes they had in mind, Karpov said that Crimea  needed more political and economic powers. If this happened, he  said, the Crimean experience of economic reforms would be  transferred to the whole of Ukraine.    "We do not want to be burden for Kiev, we can and we want to  earn our own money," Karpov said.    On the question of the Black Sea Fleet Karpov said that the  fleet "is a Russia fleet on Crimean territory. For this reason  it should pay rent. It should be based at Sevastopol and the  Ukrainian Navy should be based outside Crimea in Odessa and  Nikolaevo."</p>

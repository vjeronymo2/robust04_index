			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yusuf Ozal: "Economic Situation Is Critical"] </F>   [Text] The reason we are where we are today is that we did  not take the necessary measures at various stages in the past  and did not adapt correct economic policies. [Prime Minister  Tansu] Ciller says "I did not do it all by myself." This is  partly true. However, she also says "I am trying to undo the  mistakes of the last past 10 years." It would be hard to agree  with that statement. I am going to give you an example to  explain how critical is the situation we are in. The total  balance of payments deficit between 1982 and 1992 -- Ozal  governments and the Yildirim Akbulut, Mesut Yilmaz, Suleyman  Demirel, and Ciller governments -- is less than the total  balance of payments deficit in 1993. The situation is that  serious.    The recent economic situation is a big fiasco. In other  words, in this chaotic situation, one prime minister went  through two governors of the central bank. This is  unacceptable. This is a crisis. I know both [former governor]  Rustu Saracoglu and [former governor] Bulent Gultekin. They are  decent and professional officials. Gultekin has a very good  background and he knows his job. I do not think the prime  minister is known outside of the country as well as Gultekin  from an academic career perspective. To make a comparison, we  can say that these bureaucrats know their jobs better than  Ciller. The head of the central bank reached a point where he  was not able to do his job. Actually, this was the cause of his  frustration.    Saracoglu stayed on the job because of [President Suleyman]  Demirel. Otherwise, he would have been replaced earlier. Ciller  does not know and understand the issues. Instead of approaching  the issues properly, without being influenced by the others, her  approach to issues is "I will give the orders and the job will  get done." If this had not been the case, she would have  appointed a minister responsible for the economy. This  situation conflicts with modern methods of administering. She  has no ability to administer. She says that she is a professor.  This is true and I am sure she teaches her students about  general economics. However, this is different from  administering a government's economy which requires special  knowledge. She cannot understand this. As a matter of fact, it  is clear that she does not know the job. The recent foreign  exchange crises happened because of her inability to manage.  Because she said, "I will do the job myself" she did not  appoint an economy minister. So, she is the main reason for the  situation. However, the major opposition party leader is also  exploiting the situation. State employees are being encouraged  to resign. This is not patriotism. This is our own government  we are hurting. Let people decide for themselves if they want  to resign. There is no reason for Yilmaz [general chairman of  the Motherland Party] to provoke them. Because this provocation  will harm the country.</p>

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Italian government wins reprieve with reshuffle ITALY'S SHAKY eight-month-old gov-ernment yesterday survived its biggest political test with a cabinet reshuffle following the resignations on Friday of two senior ministers over the growing political corruption scandal. However, the skill and patience of prime minister Mr Giuliano Amato were stretched to the limit. Mr Amato met fellow ministers in his four-party coalition for four hours before agreement was reached on the new cabinet. The prime minister used the resignations of Mr Giovanni Goria and Mr Francesco De Lorenzo, the finance and health ministers respectively, to reinforce his government's standing by adding some political heavyweights. However, Mr Amato failed to broaden the government's political base because of the opposition of parties, such as the Republicans, to join a government scarred by the corruption investigations. Mr Amato hopes his swift action will restore calm to financial markets today after the frantic scenes following the resignations. The lira, which had been losing ground against leading currencies throughout last week, slid to L957 against the D-Mark, while government bond prices tumbled. The reshuffle probably means Mr Amato's government has gained a reprieve until new electoral laws, under discussion by a special parliamentary committee, come into operation. The laws, which should increase the chances of stable parliamentary majorities, are also subject to popular referendums, which could be held as early as April. Mr Nino Andreatta, a senior Christian Democrat and former minister, takes over as budget minister from Mr Franco Reviglio, the Socialist who is moving to the finance portfolio vacated by Mr Goria. Meanwhile, Mr Raffaele Costa, the former minister for regional policy and European Community affairs, steps up to become health minister, while his previous job goes to Mr Gianfranco Ciaurro. Negotiations yesterday were protracted partly because of the surprise refusal of Mr Giuseppe Guarino, the industry minister, to step down. Mr Amato had hoped to remove Mr Guarino because of his refusal to go along with ambitious privatisation plans. Instead, Mr Amato appointed Mr Paolo Baratta, his planned successor, to a new ministerial job, with responsibilities for privatisation formerly held by the industry minister. Separately, Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the environment minister and former European commissioner, said he was leaving the Socialist party for the Democratic Alliance being formed by some politicians and intellectuals. The scandal continued to spread at the weekend. Mr Antonio Cariglia, chairman of the Social Democratic party, which forms part of the ruling coalition, was informed by magistrates that he is under investigation over alleged kickbacks linked to the port of Manfredonia.

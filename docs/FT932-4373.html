			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: De Klerk seeks more added value from mining industry PRESIDENT FW de Klerk yesterday urged the South African mining industry to add value to the resources it mines saying it was 'vitally important' that the country's minerals be beneficiated to a much greater degree. Addressing the annual general meeting of the Chamber of Mines in Johannesburg, Mr de Klerk said: 'We simply have to achieve maximal exploitation of our non-renewable natural resources.' His comments came against the background of a mining industry facing increased competition in some areas from new market entrants, and also suffering the effects of a prolonged commodity recession. Mr de Klerk said that given the enormous development challenges facing the country, 'it is of the utmost importance that the future role of the mineral industry should not diminish'. Although the gold industry has experienced hard times, Mr de Klerk said 'it need not be on a declining trend'. He said the government was keen to stimulate expansion of the jewellery industry and to attract foreign investors and their marketing skills. Recent moves include removing the ad valorem duty on local jewellery sales and the introduction of a local gold loan system for jewellery manufacturers. Mr de Klerk noted that, using conservative price projections, South Africa still had at least 18,000 tonnes of refined gold that could viably be recovered. He welcomed the Columbus and Alusaf projects, announced during the last year, which, respectively, involve beneficiation of ferrochrome and offer opportunities for the downstream manufacture of aluminium products. In the presidential address, Mr Bobby Godsell stressed the need to achieve an 'enabling environment' for the mining industry. Key ingredients include political progress - Mr de Klerk expressed confidence that the negotiations process was on schedule - social stability, constructive labour relations, appropriate regulation and 'market friendly economic management'. On the latter count, Mr Godsell made two pleas: That the industry be taxed on its profits, 'not have impost after impost placed on its costs in various forms such as resource taxes, mineral levies, royalties and regulatory charges ..' For special tax concessions, such as accelerated tax write-offs to take account of 'the particular risks, the wasting asset nature, and the long lead times in generating any return on mining investment'. He acknowledged recent progress made by Mr Derek Keys, finance minister, including: Promising to remove the import surcharge for mining companies that export more than 15 per cent of their product; Promising a case-by-case lifting of ring-fencing tax provisions; and Accommodating specific industry concerns relating to the new Secondary Tax on Companies.</p>

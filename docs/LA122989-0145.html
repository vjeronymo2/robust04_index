			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> DEA REJECTS MOVE TO RECLASSIFY MARIJUANA FOR MEDICAL THERAPY  </P> <P> The Drug Enforcement Administration rejected a recommendation today that  marijuana be reclassified for use as a prescription medicine to treat patients  suffering from glaucoma, cancer and other diseases.  </P> <P> DEA Administrator John Lawn announced the order, saying the hallucinogenic drug  will remain "under the strictest level of federal control."  </P> <P> The Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics and the National Organization for the  Reform of Marijuana Laws first petitioned the agency in the 1970s, seeking to  make marijuana available for medical use.  </P> <P> Administrative Law Judge Francis Young, who presided over hearings in the case,  recommended in 1988 that the DEA recognize marijuana as having medicinal  applications.  </P> <P> Lawn rejected that judge's recommendation, finding "a lack of credible evidence  to support a conclusion that safety, efficacy and acceptance had been  demonstrated for the medical use of marijuana."  </P></p>

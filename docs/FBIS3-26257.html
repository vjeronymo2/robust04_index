At the conference, Governor Wan Xueyuan  delivered a speech on implementing guidelines of the national  economic work conference and the ninth provincial CPC congress,  and on doing a good job in this year's economic work.    Vice Governor Chai Songyue presided over yesterday's  conference. Among the other provincial government leaders  present at the conference were Liu Xirong, Long Anding, Zhang  Qimei, and Xu Zhichun.    In his speech, Wan Xueyuan first analyzed the current  economic situation and said: Under the leadership of the CPC  Central Committee and the State Council, governments at various  levels in the province have firmly grasped the central task of  economic construction, and have made new achievements in  deepening reform and stepping up development in 1993. First,  having achieved a higher economic growth rate in the previous  year, Zhejiang still maintained the trend of rapid growth.  Second, following the guidelines of the central authorities,  Zhejiang paid attention to making due efforts in straightening  out financial and taxation order and has accomplished positive  achievements in macroeconomic regulation and control. Third,  centered around the establishment of a socialist market economic  system, Zhejiang has taken new action in reform and opening up.  One of the important features in last year's economic work was:  While strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control,  Zhejiang continued to maintain a higher economic growth rate and  take a still greater step in reform and opening up, and  accumulating preliminary experience for doing a good job in  macroeconomic regulation and control under new economic  conditions in the future.    Wan Xueyuan said: The year 1994 is an important year for  comprehensively promoting reform and continuing to step up  economic development. It is also a year of crucial importance  to the implementation of the 8th Five-Year Plan. The  international and domestic environments will provide favorable  conditions for a sustained, rapid, and healthy economic growth  this year. The reform in the systems of taxation, banking,  investment, foreign trade, and management of state assets will  offer more opportunities for accelerating economic development,  and Zhejiang will continue to expect a favorable trend in  economic development this year. Naturally, some contradictions  inherent in the economic life remain to be solved, and after the  release of the central authorities' significant reform measures,  the impact of the friction aroused from the transfer of the old  system to the new one on Zhejiang's economic development at a  certain stage brooks no underestimation. Despite many  difficulties, opportunity is still the priority. We should  fully recognize the favorable conditions for reform and  development, and seize the opportune moment to promote reform  and step up development.    Wan Xueyuan expounded the guiding ideology and tasks for  provincial economic work this year. The guiding ideology for  this year's economic work is: Comprehensively carry out  the guidelines of the 3d Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee and the 9th provincial CPC congress; further  emancipate the minds; seize the opportunity; deepen reform;  improve infrastructure; develop markets; upgrade quality; bring  about a sustained, rapid, and healthy economic growth; promote  social and political stability; and strive for basically  fulfilling various targets of the Eighth Five-Year Plan one year  ahead of schedule.    Speaking on further emancipating minds and intensifying  reform, Wang Xueyuan said: In reforming the macro system, we  should follow the national plan and take the initiative in  adapting to this plan on the basis of Zhejiang's actual  situation. After we have adopted the new financial and tax  systems, we should make genuine efforts to shift the focus of  our financial and tax work to readjusting the industrial  structure and product mix, achieving higher economic returns,  tapping new tax resources that will increase our revenues, and  striving to make a bigger "cake." According to the demands of  the CPC Central Committee, we should conscientiously reform the  systems governing banking and investment affairs, the management  of fixed state-owned assets, and the management of external  economic relations.    The reform of the property rights system will be the center  of this year's reform. In accordance with the requirements set  for modern enterprises, we should categorize various projects  and achieve breakthroughs in key areas. Collective enterprises  in urban and rural areas should carry out the corporate system,  and some fair-sized private enterprises should also be guided to  adopt the corporate system. Large and medium state-owned  enterprises should be restructured to become corporations, most  enterprises should be restructured to become limited-liability  companies, and some enterprises should be turned into  incorporated companies. As for those small enterprises and  those operationally hopeless medium enterprises, they should be  handled with even more flexible measures. Some may be leased or  auctioned off, some may become collectively or independently  operated units, and some may go bankrupt. Under the premise of  ensuring the dominant role of public ownership, positive efforts  should be made to develop private economies.    To supplement the modern enterprise system, we should  quicken  the pace of cultivating the market system, and give priority to  cultivating markets of important production ingredients such as  banking, property rights transfer, labor, technology, real  estate, and capital goods. The reform of the social security  system is a very important supplementary reform vital to whether  enterprise reform can go deeper. It is also important for  maintaining social stability. The general orientation of the  reform is to break the bounds among workers of various  enterprises; consolidate the management, separate enterprises  from the government, and adopt different measures in urban and  rural areas. The cost should be rationally borne by three sides  -- the state, units, and individuals. We must speed up  restructuring of the urban housing system. While focusing on  selling public-owned quarters, we should "sell, rent, and build"  living quarters at the same time to quicken the construction of  urban housing projects -- especially those housing projects for  easing housing congestion and affordable housing projects for  low-income people -- and promote the construction of living  quarters sold as a commodity.    Speaking on heightening the awareness of opening up and  developing an open economy, Wan Xueyuan said: The key for  Zhejiang to develop an open economy and open up wider to the  outside world still lies in further heightening the awareness of  opening up. We should perfect Zhejiang's development strategy  by putting ourselves in the great international environment, and  adjust Zhejiang's economic structure according to the  requirements set for an open economy. This year we should  launch a provincial campaign to remobilize and reeducate the  people on the need to heighten the awareness of opening up and  opening wider to the outside world and seize current  opportunities at home and abroad to promote Zhejiang's external  economic relations to a new level.    To develop an open economy, we should open wider to the  outside world by following the plan drawn up by the provincial  party committee and the provincial government. In foreign  trade, we should do a good job in linking up the old and new  systems to guarantee a smooth transition. We should  systematically rewrite the rules governing property rights of  foreign trade enterprises, and their organization and  management. We must have a stronger concept for developing  "sizable economy and trade" and encourage all quarters to earn  more foreign exchange through expanding export. We should  continue to steadily develop businesses of contracting foreign  projects, exporting labor services, and providing consultative  services for designs so that we can promote export of equipment  and ordinary commodities through economic ties, trade, and  technological services. We should actively and steadily develop  enterprises abroad and encourage overseas enterprises with the  necessary resources to gradually develop into overseas  enterprise groups with multiple functions such as production,  trade, export of labor services, bringing in foreign capital,  and training qualified personnel.    Speaking on intensifying the construction of agriculture and  the infrastructure to lay a firm foundation for stepping up  economic development, Wan Xueyuan said: The role of agriculture  has become even more important as the foundation of Zhejiang's  economy. Governments at various levels and all departments  concerned must implement the measures set by the rural work  conference to the letter. It is necessary to use various  economic and administrative means to keep the sown area for  grain at a certain level. First, the fields for growing grain  must not be left uncultivated; we must take necessary  administrative measures, intensify supervision, and speed up the  cultivation of such fields. Second, it is necessary to control  the farmland that switches to new crops after growing certain  crops for years. Third, we should increase economic returns by  improving and popularizing strains of grain, promoting economies  of scale, and running well the sophisticated processing of grain  and cooking oil. We should continue to readjust and optimize  the structure of Zhejiang's agricultural production and take the  advantage of the province's supremacy in diversified  agricultural production to actually push the agricultural  production to the market. The development of village and town  enterprises, and high-yield, high-efficiency, and fine-quality  agriculture are the two wheels carrying our rural areas toward  market and overall development; we should continue to promote  the process of turning rural areas into markets through  deepening reform in accordance with the principle of making  progress in the course of development and developing in the  course of reform. We should stabilize the right of contracting  land and make good use of land use rights. The economies of  scale in agriculture should be vigorously promoted in areas  where rural economy develops at a faster pace to raise the level  of socialized division of labor and coordination in agriculture.  The partnership system in the form of stock sharing should be  popularized and promoted in village and town enterprises, and  energetic support should be given to sizable village and town  enterprises in re-organization and transformation so they will  be upgraded to a new level. In the meantime, the partnership  system in the form of stock sharing should also be promoted in  various sectors such as rural plantations, aquatic product  breeding, and circulation as soon as possible. Regarding this  year's work on rural areas, agriculture, and peasants, we should  strive to increase peasants' income: On the one hand, we should  vigorously expand production and strive for a good harvest of  agricultural production, particularly grain, cotton, cooking  oil, and vegetables. We should increase peasants' income  through developing high-yield, high-efficiency, and fine-quality  agriculture as well as developing village and town enterprises  and private enterprises. On the other hand, we should continue  to look to the work of reducing peasants' burden, step up the  formulation of laws and regulations, standardize the collection  of fees from peasants, and protect peasants' interests. We  should continue to make greater efforts to eliminate poverty,  step up the pace of relocating people in order to improve their  living standards, and attach importance to anti-poverty policies.    Speaking on strengthening the construction of the  infrastructure, Wan Xueyuan said: We must keep the idea of  advancing ahead of others in mind, and pool the strength of the  entire society to steadfastly construct Zhejiang's key  infrastructure including transportation, power supply,  telecommunications, and water conservancy. We should come up  with more ideas for raising funds and, along with the reform in  the investment system, constantly deepen the reform in the  system of investing in infrastructure such as transportation,  power supply, telecommunications, and water conservancy. We  should gradually introduce the corporate system and improve and  perfect the responsibility system of investment by legal  entities.    Speaking on using the market as a guide, and scientific and  technological progress as a motive force to raise the quality of  economic growth, Wan Xueyuan said: As market forces play an  increasingly bigger role and as reform deepens, market  competition will become increasingly fierce and economic growth  achieved through the increase of output will be more difficult  to sustain. We will lose many markets if we do not step up  readjustment of our industrial structure, pay more attention to  product quality, and increase economic returns. We must ensure  tangible progress in this year's economic work. First, we must  pay attention to the economy of scale and raise the standards of  our industry-based economy. While continuing to maintain the  vitality of our "light and small" enterprises by raising the  level of cooperation in their specialized fields, we must select  large and high-standard projects when we establish new  enterprises. Particularly in developed coastal areas, we must  raise the threshold of new projects and approach the question  from the viewpoint of restructuring the province's industry. On  no account should we launch low-standard, duplicate processing  industrial projects. Second, we must adjust product mixes and  raise product qualities. We must guide enterprises in  vigorously developing readily salable new products and new  varieties in different categories to satisfy consumers in  different sectors and at different levels; and at the same time,  we must earnestly protect the reputation of Zhejiang's products  by mercilessly cracking down on the manufacture and sale of  substandard and fake products. To raise the quality of  Zhejiang's products, we must rely on science and technology and  education, intensify technological transformation, and encourage  technology research and new product development. We must select  a number of industries to carry out industry-wide technological  transformation. In accordance with the demand to industrialize  scientific and technological undertakings, transform research  institutions into enterprises, and commercialize scientific and  technological achievements to sell them in the market, we must  actively reform our science and technology management structure,  and establish and develop a mechanism that encourages  enterprises to take the initiative to obtain scientific and  technological research results. We should put more emphasis on  training practical personnel in schools. We should deepen  education reform and step up training talented personnel, using  the resources of our entire society. Third, we must step up our  efforts to develop backbone industries. We must further work  out sound plans to develop electric, machinery, textile, silk,  chemical, food, and building materials industries, and draw up  specific plans for implementing development of such industries  as power and telecommunications equipment, transportation  equipment, pharmaceuticals, construction machinery, new-type  high-grade synthetic materials, and new-type building materials.    Speaking of ways to show earnest concern for and arrange  well  the people's daily life, and to do tangible things for them, Wan  Xueyuan said: This year's reform will enter a period during  which difficult problems will be tackled. We must not take the  price situation lightly. Governments at all levels must show  concern for and arrange well the people's daily life and  earnestly do some good things for the people from the viewpoint  of stabilizing the general situation and society, and ensuring  the smooth progress of reform. First, we must make adequate  arrangements for the people's food and vegetables. To resolve  the problem of "vegetable basket," we must first stabilize and  develop vegetable bases; second, actively create conditions to  gradually set up funds to regulate the prices of vegetables,  pigs, and other products; and third, implement sound reform of  the vegetable circulation structure, and cultivate and establish  a market system. The price issue involves the question of the  capacity of our budget, enterprises, and masses to tolerate the  changes, and the question of social stability. We must do  everything possible to successfully manage the market and  increase the residents' income and effective supply. We must  continue to strengthen our supervision and control of commodity  prices and strictly forbid speculation and hoarding to jack up  commodity prices and manipulate the market so as to reap  exorbitant profits. We must bring into full play the role of  public opinion and the masses in monitoring commodity prices.  We must establish a mechanism promoting normal income growth  and do our utmost to ensure that the increase in workers' wages  exceeds the level of price increases.    Wan Xueyuan stressed: Our tasks related to reform,  development, and stability are extremely heavy this year. New  situations and problems will continue to emerge. To achieve our  economic goals, governments at all levels must pay particular  attention to and strengthen leadership over economic work.  First, we must change the government's leadership functions in  economic work. Second, we must intensify study, investigation,  and research. Third, we must strengthen leadership and pay  close attention to implementation. While conducting economic  work, governments at all levels should also firmly uphold the  policy of fostering both material and cultural and ideological  progress, and attach equal importance to both. We must pay  close attention to building spiritual civilization,  comprehensively tackling problems of public order, building a  clean government, and carrying out other undertakings of social  development. Wan Xueyuan concluded by urging everyone to use  their brains, spend more time on the question of development,  and pay more attention to stability. He asked them to think  ahead, boldly practice, have the courage to lead and make  breakthroughs, seek development in the course of reform, and  deepen reform in the process of development. At the same time,  he urged them to pay particular attention to social and economic  stability, and set people's minds at ease.    Responsible comrades from various city (prefectural) and  county governments as well as provincial departments attended  the meeting. Meetings on planning, economic work, financial  work, economic restructuring, and foreign relations and trade  were simultaneously held.</p>

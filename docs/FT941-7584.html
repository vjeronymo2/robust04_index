			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / IoD hoists new flags Two new flags were hoisted outside the Institute of Directors' Pall Mall headquarters yesterday. On the old flags the IoD's initials were all the same size. But yesterday, the O was smaller and the D was bigger. Moreover the D seemed to have been printed on top of the O. This was no mistake, it was the IoD's new 'visual personality' which Mr Peter Morgan, its director-general, unveiled with pride yesterday. 'The new logo emphasises the D is for Director' he said. The cost of the logo, which was designed by Mr Alan Fletcher - who has worked on corporate identity for Reuters and Lloyd's of London - was Pounds 60,000, of which Pounds 40,000 was design fees. This compares with the millions spent by companies such as BT. The logo is part of an attempt to improve the IoD's sense of design, and make its documents and brochures smarter. 'We do our radical policy papers no favour by producing them in banal covers,' Mr Morgan said. He defended the decision to spend the money. 'Corporate identity is a vehicle to underpin the product,' he said.</p>

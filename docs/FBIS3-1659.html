			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by XINHUA reporter Feng Xiuju (7458 4423 5468): </F> "Long-Premeditated Actions -- Commenting on the British Hong  Kong Legislative Council's Adoption of Patten's Partial  Political System Bill and Britain's Publication of Its White  Paper"]    [Text] Beijing, 26 Feb (XINHUA) -- After meticulously  directing one clumsy "farce" after another inside and outside of  Hong Kong, Governor Patten, in doggedly defying China's repeated  statements and acts of persuasion and disregarding the strong  desire of the people of all walks of life in Hong Kong for a  resolution through negotiations of the 1994-95 election  arrangements, finally submitted his partial political system  bill [bu fen zheng zhi fang an -- 6752 0433 2398 0455 2455 2714]  for adoption by the Legislative Council [Legco] on 24 February.    Meanwhile, Britain, in violating the understanding reached  between China and Britain for the confidentiality of the  contents of the Sino-British talks, published a lengthy,  10,000-word white paper, thus unilaterally disclosing the  details of talks. The next day, the Hong Kong Government  published in the gazette the second-phase political system bill.    The series of actions are by no means accidental. They are  an inevitable outcome of Britain changing its policy toward  China and clinging to the "three violations" stand. They amply  demonstrate that Britain alone has closed the door to  negotiations and has taken the road of all-out confrontation  with China on the question of Hong Kong's political system. All  Chinese people, including the people of Hong Kong, absolutely  cannot tolerate Britain's long-premeditated actions.    As is universally known, Patten, as early as in 1992,  shortly  after he assumed the post of Hong Kong governor, assumed a  facade of benevolence and, under the banner of "expanding  democracy," systematically and step by step peddled the  political system bill in an attempt to change Hong Kong's  current political system and to promote pro-British and  anti-Chinese elements in the political arena so that after 1997  Hong Kong would become an independent or semi-independent  political entity controlled by Britain but beyond the reach of  the Chinese central government. His sinister intentions are all  too clear.    For starters, in October 1992, Patten, without previous  announcements, suddenly dished up the political system bill in  his government work report, thus breaking the state of  consultations and cooperation which had existed between China  and Britain since the signing, through negotiations, of the  Joint Declaration on the Hong Kong question. As a result, open  polemics ensued for as long as six months.    Then, last April Britain was compelled to begin negotiations  with China on the question of the 1994-95 Hong Kong election  arrangements. At the negotiating table, however, Britain  constantly resorted to double-level tactics, uttering glib words  while secretly playing small tricks and trying by hook and by  crook to impede the progress of the negotiations.    Later on, when China and Britain almost reached agreement on  the question of elections for the district board and the two  municipal councils, Britain raised news issues and insisted on  including in the negotiations the method for holding the Legco  elections. It also flagrantly announced the suspension of the  negotiations on election arrangements for regional  organizations, and it unilaterally proceeded to enact laws.  Despite all these things, China still repeatedly stated that on  the precondition that Britain withdrew some of its bills from  the Legco, the door to negotiations would be wide open.  However, Britain ignored the Chinese statements and thus shut  the door to negotiations.    The aforesaid facts clearly show that both prior to and  during the negotiations, or during the three crucial stages that  led to the breakup of negotiations, Britain demonstrated no  sincerity whatsoever for cooperating with China; on the  contrary, it has gone farther and farther down the road of  confrontation.    Recently Patten took great pains to travel to Australia,  thus  more openly trying to create public support and to solicit  international support for the adoption and implementation of his  political system bill. On 19 January, upon returning from his  visit to Australia, he hurriedly submitted the partial political  system bill for adoption by the Legco. Meanwhile, Britain also  published a white paper.       Over the past year or so, the "farces" carried out by Chris  Patten were so closely staged one after another that it can be  seen that they were arranged meticulously and long premeditated.    Up to the present, Britain still keeps saying something like  Chris Patten's "three violations" constitutional reform package  is aimed at promoting Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and  has comprehensively considered the aspirations of the Hong Kong  people. How pleasant this is to the ears. However, people have  long ago put a big question mark over Britain's confession in  light of its deeds.    Everybody knows that the Hong Kong people's maximum  interests  lie in maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and in  bringing about a stable transition and smooth takeover of  political power in Hong Kong in 1997. The "Basic Law" has been  formulated over four or more years of deliberations and drafts,  and in the process the broad masses of the Hong Kong people were  fully consulted and their opinions were absorbed. One of its  important principles is to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and  stability. It is stipulated in both the preamble and general  principles of the "Basic Law" that the socialist system and  policies shall not be practiced in the Hong Kong SAR and that  the existing capitalist system and way of life shall not be  changed for 50 years. Articles 45 and 68 of the "Basic Law"  provide that Hong Kong's political system should be developed  "in light of the actual situation in the Hong Kong SAR and in  accordance with the principle of a gradual and orderly  progress." Maintaining Hong Kong's existing system and following  the principle of a "gradual and orderly progress" are both aimed  at ensuring Hong Kong's stable development and at bringing about  the transition, the takeover of political power, and the  establishment of a Hong Kong SAR government and a legislative  council in a state of stability in Hong Kong.    Therefore, these principles, which have been expounded in  the  "Basic Law" and which have identified with the broad masses of  the Hong Kong people, are truly those which are in keeping with  the fundamental interests and aspirations of the Hong Kong  people. Without consulting any Hong Kong residents, however,  Chris Patten hastily submitted a political system bill less than  three months after taking office in Hong Kong. Then, in  ignoring the call of people from various circles in Hong Kong  for settling Hong Kong's 1994-95 electoral arrangements through  negotiations, he forced the bill through the Legco. How can  this express and reflect the aspirations and interests of the  Hong Kong people?    The Sino-British Joint Declaration stipulates that the  British administration of Hong Kong will terminate on 30 June  1997 and that the Chinese Government will resume the exercise of  sovereignty over Hong Kong as of 1 July 1997. China has  reiterated that as component parts of the British political body  administering Hong Kong, the last British-Hong Kong district  boards, the two municipal councils, and the Legco will  definitely be terminated together with the end of the British  administration of Hong Kong. Under the condition that China and  Britain reach no agreements on the arrangements for the 1994-95  elections, the three-level bodies produced on the basis of the  partial electoral bill passed by the British-Hong Kong Legco or  any other electoral bill possibly to be passed in the future  will be brought to an end as the British administration comes to  an end, and they cannot be extended beyond the year 1997.    If Chris Patten believes that this bill can be consolidated  in the form of the law once it is passed and that the  three-level bodies produced on the basis of this bill can be  automatically continued after 1997, this is a badly mistaken  fantasy.    The times are progressing forward, and Hong Kong's future  destiny is in the hands of the Chinese people, including the  broad masses of the Hong Kong compatriots. No matter how far  Britain confronts China over the issue of Hong Kong's political  system, it can by no means resist the wheel of history, which is  rolling forward. People on the Chinese side maintain that as  long as the Hong Kong compatriots and the inland people make  concerted efforts to properly and comprehensively implement "one  country, two systems," Hong Kong will have a future of  incomparable brightness.</p>

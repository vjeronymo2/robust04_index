			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: Maple Leaf in third-term advance MAPLE Leaf Foods, the Canadian food processor 56 per cent owned by Hillsdown Holdings of the UK, has overcome fiercely competitive markets to report a small increase in third quarter earnings from continuing operations. The steady performance was in spite of a 6 per cent drop in sales, and was ascribed mainly to improved margins as a result of the restructuring and belt-tightening measures which Hillsdown has put in place since it took over the company in mid-1990. Earnings from continuing operations climbed to CDollars 19.4m (USDollars 15.3m), or 24 cents a share, from CDollars 15.2m, or 23 cents, a year earlier. Sales fell to CDollars 695m from CDollars 741.7m. The company also reported interest income of CDollars 1.7m, compared with financing charges of CDollars 3.3m a year earlier. Mr Charles Bowen, chief executive, said the drop in sales resulted from falling consumption and an unusually wet summer. Economies of scale helped margins in several areas of Maple Leaf's business. For example, a joint flour milling venture with ConAgra, the US food processing giant, has enabled the Canadian company to benefit from ConAgra's payroll and purchasing facilities. Pork earnings rose as a result of combining production into a single plant. On the other hand, poultry continues to suffer from over-capacity, while the bakery business was hurt by intensifying competition and down-trading to lower-priced products. Maple Leaf is seeking an acquisition in the US food industry. It has the advantage of virtually no long-term debt and cash reserves of over CDollars 160m.</p>

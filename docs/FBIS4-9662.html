			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 29 Mar (NA) -- The government has  ended the serious crisis in the Finance Ministry by decreeing  "the dismissal" of National Securities Commission President  Martin Redrado, who systematically refused to leave the post  despite losing the political support he had in the government.    Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo appointed Investments Under  Secretary Guillermo Haterneck to replace Redrado, thus making  sure that one of his trusted men is at the head of an  organization considered vital for the development of the capital  market.    Redrado's resistance to leaving his post forced the  government to evaluate two alternative decrees, one dismissing  Redrado and another one accepting his resignation.    Carlos Corach, presidential technical and legal secretary,  met with Redrado until late last night trying unsuccessfully to  convince him to adopt the least traumatic solution.    But Redrado did not accept the suggestion to resign and the  executive branch had to dismiss him, thus ending his ongoing  confrontation with Cavallo.    About midnight, before leaving for India, President Carlos  Menem signed the decree "firing" Redrado.    Alone and without much visible support in the government,  Redrado, who is only 32, saw how his last hopes were  disappearing on 28 March. [passage omitted]    The only support Redrado received was from the  pensioners,because Norma Pla went to the National Securities  Commission to applaud what was done in the process for selling  YPF [Government Oil Deposits] shares in the pensioners' hands.    This is the issue that led to Redrado's critical situation  when he rejected the first proposal presented by the U.S. firms  Merril Lynch and First Boston.    Although the second proposal had the endorsement of the  first  government position, the strong support for the pensioners  irritated the already sensitive feelings of Cavallo, who  convinced Menem of the need to get Redrado to resign.    The old disagreements between the two officials were revived  in the last few months due to their different points of view on  the destinations of funds for the Pension Fund Managing  Companies.    Minister Cavallo and Felipe Murolo, superintendent of the  Pension Fund Managing Companies, wanted well-established  guidelines for the system, but Redrado wanted to give the  greatest freedom possible to the investors.    The abrupt drop in shares on 28 March convinced officials of  the need to eradicate the uncertainty in the market.</p>

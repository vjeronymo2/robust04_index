			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Peseta plunges inside ERM SIX EUROPEAN central banks intervened on the foreign exchange markets yesterday, buying the Spanish peseta, after the currency plunged against the D-Mark in the exchange rate mechanism, writes James Blitz. The peseta finished a disastrous week by falling through its central parity against the D-Mark of Pta72.78 for the first time since its devaluation in November of last year. The currency bottomed out at at Pta74.05 against the D-Mark, still some way above its lower ERM limit of Pta77.28, and closed in London at Pta73.67. However, the fall came despite a second rise in two days in the Bank of Spain's intervention rate, this time to 15 per cent, and a level intervention that was deemed considerable for the illiquid peseta market. By the close of European trading, it had fallen 4 places in the ERM grid and was classed as the weakest currency. The belief that the peseta was ripe for devaluation was widespread in the market, the only question being as to the timing. Mr Neil MacKinnon, an economist at Citibank in London, believes there is scope for a 5-10 per cent devaluation of the currency. He believes that the official forecast of 1 per cent growth this year is optimistic, and that there will be negative GDP of 0.5 per cent in 1993. 'There is a pressing need in Spain to bring interest rates down to about 7 per cent in the third quarter of this year from the current level of 15 per cent,' he said. However, the peseta's weakness is seen as an isolated incident in the ERM. Mr Steve Hannah, a director of IBJ International, said that the falls in French and Danish money market rates in recent weeks are a sign of growing confidence in the hard core of the system. The other focus of attention yesterday was on the dollar which fell sharply against the D-Mark following another poor US economic indicator. Having failed to capitalise on Thursday's cut in the German discount rate, the dollar was weakened by a 3.7 per cent fall in US durable goods orders. The dollar bottomed out at DM1.5770 and later closed at DM1.5840, some 2 pfennigs down on the day. Sterling was a touch stronger against both the D-Mark and the dollar yesterday following stronger than expected retail sales figures for March. These rose a seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent, giving a year on year rise of 4.1 per cent. The pound closed at DM1.5840 from a previous DM1.6065. Mr Avinash Persaud, an economist at UBS, believes the DM2.50 level will soon be breached.</p>

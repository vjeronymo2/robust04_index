The Palestinian news agency WAFA said the meeting  dealt with the latest political developments, the current  Palestinian-Israeli negotiations which have so far led to the  signing of the Cairo agreement, the obstacles still preventing  progress, and implementation of the Declaration of Principles  and the need to honor the dates stated therein.    It added that the meeting "also covered the economic  situation in the occupied Palestinian territory and the aid  needed for its reconstruction and development."    Meanwhile, Fatah's Central Committee yesterday attacked  Israeli Chief of Staff General Ehud Baraq and the other generals  of the military establishment, maintaining that "they found that  the opportunity was right for them to pounce on the political  process on security grounds."    The movement's central internal bulletin, which appears  biweekly under the name of Fatah, said yesterday that Baraq and  the military "were surprised by the Oslo agreement, which was  signed without their knowledge and without consultation with  them." The bulletin, which expresses the views of Fatah's  Central Committee members, said that "Baraq spread his staff  into the negotiation process in such a way as to block any  possibility of progress in Taba. He succeeded in blocking even  the deadline set for the signing of an agreement on withdrawal  from the Gaza Strip and Jericho area."    It also attacked Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin for  responding to the generals' position. It said that "the  timetable stipulated in the Declaration of Principles agreement  is no longer sacrosanct to Rabin. Army complications are  beginning to go some way in influencing the concept of  withdrawal from Gaza."    It stressed that in the view of the chief of staff and the  military establishment, the agreement does not mean withdrawal  from Gaza but rather a redeployment within the strip "to defend  the borders against foreign threats and guarantee security of  the settlements." It added that he instructed his followers in  the Israeli negotiating delegation to impose that concept of  withdrawal.    It also attacked the Israeli military establishment for  refusing to recognize the PLO as the Palestinian people's  representative "even though the majority of Israeli politicians,  foremost among them Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, understood  the significance of recognizing the PLO and Peres instructed his  ambassadors and his UN representative to hold contacts with the  ambassadors of the state of Palestine and with the PLO office  directors and its observer at the United Nations, reflecting  that understanding."</p>

			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STARVING ARTISTS  </P> <P> Perhaps Armand Hammer is getting more respect than he deserves.  </P> <P> In response to the May 28 letter from Melinda Stephens ("Oxy Art for  Everyone"), who responded to your May 11 article on the use of Occidental  Petroleum funds to glorify Hammer with a museum named after him, I think it is  horrendous to use corporate capital in this way.  </P> <P> I am particularly opposed to the plan because Armand Hammer has consistently  paid millions for the works of dead artists while lacking the courage,  conviction and compassion to invest similar sums of money into the creations of  living artists.  </P> <P> Hammer repeats the mistakes of those insensitive art lovers who allowed Van  Gogh and others to live and die in the horrible pain of poverty.  </P> <P> Hammer deserves respect as a businessman for his achievements. But it is a slap  in the face of living and dead artists to permit his name to be respected in  the art world, when he has demonstrated such insensitivity to the plight of  living artists.  </P> <P> RHONA DAVIS  </P> <P> Potomac, Md.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE;  </P> <P> SDC DEVELOPMENT AMONG BUYERS OF UNION PACIFIC LAND  </P> <P> When Union Pacific Corp. put its massive landholdings up for sale, Koll Co.  wasn't the only local developer that went shopping. (In the largest deal in its  history, Koll bought a half-billion dollars worth of land and buildings from  the railroad recently.)  </P> <P> SDC Development, a much smaller neighbor of Koll's in Newport Beach, paid Union  Pacific $16 million for an industrial park called Mira Loma Industrial Center  in Riverside County.  </P> <P> SDC will sell some of the 183 acres at Mira Loma and build factories and  warehouses on the rest. In all there will eventually be 3 million square feet  of industrial space at the park with a value of more than $100 million.  </P> <P> "SDC considers the Mira Loma Industrial Center as the jewel of all Union  Pacific Realty's former properties," Senior Vice President Jim Watson said in a  press release.  </P> <P> The railroad decided last year to sell thousands of acres and dozens of  buildings around the nation in an effort to boost its stock price. The real  estate was worth a lot, but it wasn't bringing in the big money quick enough to  suit investors. Sure enough, the stock went up Tuesday when the Koll sale was  announced.  </P> <P> If Koll bought most of the property, other companies like SDC managed to nick  off a piece or two by getting a foot in the door before the big developer.  </P> <P> In fact, SDC said it wouldn't have minded grabbing a few more pieces.  </P> <P> "There were some other things we were interested in," said Charlie Kanne, vice  president of SDC's industrial division. "But Koll bought everything they had  left."  </P> <P> SDC operates mostly in the Southwest. Its biggest project is a joint venture to  develop 345 acres it bought a few months ago in an industrial neighborhood near  the Irvine Spectrum, a huge office and industrial park at the junction of the  San Diego and Santa Ana freeways in Irvine.  </P> <P> Construction on the Mira Loma park, meanwhile, is to begin by fall.  </P> <P> Compiled by Michael Flagg / Times staff writer  </P></p>

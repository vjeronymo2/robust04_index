Management at the Saigon Shoe Factory in Ho Chi Minh  City complained that workers had not given any notice of the  24-hour strike that began Saturday, the Nguoi Lao Dong newspaper  reported.    Workers said the demands made by their "tense" work were too  great and their payments too low, common complaints at factories  here under contract to foreign clients, particularly South  Koreans. But after talks with the Ho Chi Minh City Federation of  Labour, the workers returned to the factory, which has seen two  earlier strikes in the past two-months.    The labour ministry said last month that workers would be  allowed to strike as a last resort but should give two-weeks  notice of any industrial action.    Reports of strikes, particularly in the south of the  country,  are becoming more common, with three large shutdowns just before  the Lunar New Year holiday last month.</p>

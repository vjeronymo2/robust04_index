			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / International Company News: A master of good timing - Bombardier's aerospace forays CANADA'S Bombardier transport equipment group has assumed a leading role in the world regional airliner and business jet markets through a five-year marathon of astutely-timed takeovers. The final step is the recent acquisition of de Havilland Canada (DHC), the Toronto turboprop commuter aircraft builder, from Boeing of the US. Bombardier took over the company after Aerospatiale-Alenia, the French-Italian makers of the successful ATR commuter plane, had their bid rejected on competition grounds by the European Commission. Bombardier will have to compete against the giants of aerospace as they jostle for position in the growing regional airliner markets. Its strategy, however, is to stay firmly in the 30-to-70 passenger niche. DHC has nearly 30 per cent of the turboprop sector. Bombardier began its foray into aerospace in 1986 when it bought Montreal's Canadair, caught by a downdraft in the business jet market, from the Canadian government. It soon took over Short Brothers in Belfast from the British government. This was followed by Learjet in the US, and now DHC. Mr Laurent Beaudoin and Mr Raymond Royer, chairman and president of Bombardier, were initially reluctant to move their mass transit equipment and snowmobile company into aerospace. But they became more confident with each takeover: they could see how aerospace had the potential to double their business quickly and at low risk. They have driven hard bargains with governments, suppliers and trade unions, and have insisted on guarantees such as those covering losses on past contracts, research and export finance support, job flexibility and competitive pay contracts. In return, Bombardier has offered, among other things, heavy investment in modern equipment and it has developed a full range of aircraft for world markets. The company goes to great lengths to win workforce support, providing full training from shop floor to executive level, and where possible it keeps existing management. This strategy is being applied at DHC, where Bombardier has gained 51 per cent ownership and full operating control for CDollars 51m (USDollars 43.9m) with the Ontario government as a 49 per cent equity partner. The deal is backed by a package of nearly CDollars 500m in federal and provincial support. Bombardier has to restructure a company with more than 3,000 employees, including 500 engineers and technicians, at a plant where CDollars 1bn has been spent on modernisation over the past five years. It has also to fill out the Dash-8 turboprop family to a full 30-70 passenger range  - these aircraft are designed for trips of up to 90 minutes. DHC has made about 350 so far. The Canadair 50-passenger Regional Jet, using fan-jet engines, is intended for trips of more than 90 minutes. Bombardier believes the two product lines are complementary and can be sold to the same feeder airlines operating within modern hub systems. Comair, a Delta feeder line in the US and a big user of turboprops, recently gave Canadair a CDollars 200m order for Regional Jets. DHC will add about CDollars 450m to Bombardier's sales in the year ending January 31 1993. It will bring Bombardier's annual aerospace revenues, including defence products, to around CDollars 3bn, out of a total of about CDollars 4bn, including mass transit equipment and snowmobiles. 'They're getting a very good plant at minimum risk and their timing is right,' said Mr Richard Stoneman, engineer and analyst with Deacon Barclays de Zoete Wedd. 'They're building critical mass in a single market sector. The aerospace cycle can be tricky, but they've shown they can manage.' Bombardier's aerospace order book now stands at more than CDollars 5bn and its mass transit equipment backlog is about CDollars 2.5bn. The company, including DHC, will have a payroll of nearly 30,000 with plants in seven countries, including the UK, France and Belgium. The mass transit subsidiaries in Europe are being meshed in a new holding company. Bombardier has successfully turned three ugly ducklings of aerospace around and must now repeat the process at DHC. The timing, at least, seems favourable. The workforce has given the deal an enthusiastic welcome, and the commercial aircraft market seems finally to be climbing out of its Gulf war tailspin.</p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: New issue flood looms over Bombay equities - The prospects for India's stock markets after this year's scandals A sharp decline in India's scandal-hit stock markets in the past month is making life increasingly difficult for companies seeking to raise funds in the capital markets. The Bombay Stock Exchange's (BSE) 30-share index dropped by 14.5 per cent between October 1 and last Friday, including a 5.3 per cent fall last week. After Friday's ban on short sales, and closing for settlement work on Monday, it recovered 3.3 per cent to 2,928 yesterday; but volume was thin and institutional interest was limited. Confidence has been hit by lingering concern about the scandal in the inter-bank securities market, in which leading stockbrokers are involved, and by the shock of mass tax raids on brokers' offices two weeks ago. Investors have also been swamped by a flood of new issues, including rights issues. Companies are planning to raise an estimated Rs150bn (Dollars 5.3bn) in equity and equity-linked bonds in the financial year which started in April, compared with Rs57.4bn in the whole of 1991-92. It is surprising that signs of financial indigestion did not appear earlier. The scandal first erupted in April and punctured a 15-month rally in equity prices in the secondary market. The BSE 30-share index slid from its April peak as financial institutions reported heavy scandal-linked losses and the exchange closed for a month. However, investors' appetite for primary issues has remained strong, primarily because of the extremely large discounts offered in the primary market. Lured by mass-marketing campaigns involving posters and newspaper advertisements, investors flocked to stag issues - that is to buy in the primary market and quickly sell the stock in the secondary market. The market's recent plunge has closed the stags' window of opportunity as prices in the secondary market have fallen, sharply reducing the discounts offered in the new issue market. Mr R Sankaran, managing director of Ind-Global Financial Services, a leading securities company, says: 'The investor is becoming more mature and consequently more discriminating in subscribing to new issues and rights issues. He has a choice now.' The first big company to have run into difficulties is Ceat Tyres, one of India's largest tyre makers and a member of the RPG group, a Calcutta-based industrial conglomerate. Ceat initially set a deadline of October 14 for acceptances for a Rs1.1bn rights issue, but has extended the offer to October 31 to give shareholders more time to respond. It said application forms had been held up in the post. But the poor response from shareholders may be more readily explained by the fact that the discount between the offer price of Rs75 and the market price has dropped in the past month from Rs60 to Rs37. Other companies could well avoid the same fate if they stick to the deep discounts traditionally offered in the Bombay stock market. For example, investment bankers see little difficulty in the issues planned by Gujarat Fertilisers, a large fertiliser producer, and HCL-Hewlett Packard, an electronics group linked to Hewlett Packard, of the US. Both are launching convertible bonds where the conversion price is only one-third of the market price. Mr Udayan Bose, chairman of Credit Capital Finance, a leading investment bank, believes that the good issues will go through. He also believes that investors will, if necessary, sell existing holdings to buy competitively priced new stock. If new issues have to be cancelled or postponed, companies will lose a valuable source of new capital, just as they are gearing up to invest to take advantage of the opportunities created by the reformist policies of the government of Mr Narasimha Rao, the prime minister. With bank credit tight and commercial lending rates running at around 18 per cent, equity capital has been a key source of cheap funds since dividend yields average around 1.3 per cent. Moreover, companies have only been able to raise funds freely through equity issues since March this year, when the government abolished a rule which required issue prices to be set by a bureaucrat - the capital issues controller. The controller typically insisted on deep discounts in order to favour state-owned financial institutions, which are India's principal investors. Under the new system, issues have to be vetted by the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the securities watchdog, which examines claims made in prospectuses.</p>

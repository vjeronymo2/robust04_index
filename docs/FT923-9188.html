			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Fall in job-related training admitted THE PROPORTION of workers receiving job-related training has declined noticeably during the recession, a Department of Employment analysis acknowledged yesterday. The report in the department's Employment Gazette also suggests that many of the participants in the government's Employment Training and Youth Training schemes do not believe they are receiving significant amounts of job-related training. The analysis, which draws on statistics published earlier this year in the annual Labour Force Survey, will heighten fears that skill shortages will emerge as a restraint on economic growth once the present recession ends. Although this happened in the previous recession in the early 1980s, the government had hoped that companies would heed its calls to maintain training budgets at their pre-recession levels. The Employment Gazette report shows that 14.9 per cent, or 3.16m employees, of working age in Britain reported receiving training related to their jobs in the four weeks before the Labour Force Survey in the spring of last year. Although this represents a significant increase on figures in the early 1980s - it compares with 9.2 per cent in 1984 - it is down on the 15.4 per cent of 1990. The likelihood is that the proportion will have decreased considerably further since the spring of last year because the recession has continued for longer than many analysts and employers expected. The gazette's report also charts a decline in apprenticeships. On the basis of responses to the survey it is estimated that 330,000 people in Britain were doing an apprenticeship last year, against 367,000 in 1989, when they were at their peak following the recession of the early 1980s. An encouraging statistic for the government is that training programmes such as YT, ET and apprenticeships account for only about 10 per cent of training activity recorded by the survey. This indicates that the other 90 per cent of people who said they had received job-related training in the four weeks before the survey were getting it on a continuing basis as part of their employment. However, the analysis notes that nearly 200,000 of the 738,000 people who said they were participating in YT, ET or trade apprenticeship did not feel they had undertaken any job-related training in the four weeks before the survey. This will fuel fears about the effectiveness of some of the training schemes. The analysis says there are no obvious reasons for the responses, although 'variations in individuals' perception of what constitutes job-related training is a possible explanation. 'For example, some may not consider work experience or on-the-job learning as being related to training.' The analysis also notes that off-the-job training was the most common format and the incidence of training generally declined with age. Employment Gazette, August 1992. HMSO.

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ecuador looks to Amazon for oil production boost The Ecuadorean government has awarded international petroleum companies rights to explore 2m hectares of Ecuador's Amazon rain forest. The move is seen as evidence of the government's determination to boost proven crude oil reserves and increase production dramatically in the coming decade. Over the next three years, production is expected to increase by about 30 per cent from new fields coming on line. The so-called Seventh Round of bidding has created great interest among foreign investors because of the area's promising geological structures and the government's recently introduced market-oriented reforms. Ten companies, among them the US majors Mobil and Amoco, are to sign contracts with the government before the end of the year. Other US companies are participating in consortia with Canadian, Kuwaiti and Chilean companies. The new contractual basis awards oil companies between 65 per cent and 85 per cent of production rather than the previously fixed level of compensation. The companies are contracted to drill 17 wells, beginning in July of next year, and have up to four years to complete the exploratory phase. Production is expected to begin in 1999. The exploratory phase will require an estimated USDollars 142m in foreign investment, of which a total of Dollars 6.7m will go towards environment protection efforts. Mr Francisco Acosta, the energy minister, stressed that the government would apply strict environmental regulations. According to officials of the state oil company, Petroequador, prospects for discovering crude oil are good. So far 54 per cent of the exploratory wells drilled in the country have yielded positive results. In some of the blocks on which concessions have been awarded, oil fields have already been discovered, though not explored. New discoveries are expected to be of heavy crude oil. The average API has already dropped from 30 to 28 and is forecast to fall to near 25 by 1999. Two companies, BHP King and Tripetrol, have been awarded rights to explore for natural gas in the Gulf of Guayaquil, on Ecuador's Pacific coast.</p>

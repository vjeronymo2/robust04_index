			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 FOUND SLAIN AT REMOTE SHOOTING RANGE IN FOREST  </P> <P> The bodies of two men who were shot to death after going to a remote shooting  range in the Angeles National Forest were discovered by an off-duty police  officer who went to the spot for target practice, authorities said Thursday.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies said the shootings were not accidental and a murder  investigation is proceeding. No arrests have been made and there are no  suspects.  </P> <P> The victims were identified as Ernesto Banegas Jr., 30, of Arcadia, and Clayton  Blasingame, 20, of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Their bodies were found about 6:30 p.m. Wednesday at the Middle Shooting Range  in Upper Big Tujunga Canyon, northeast of Pasadena, Sgt. Ernie Roop said.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles police officer, whose name was not released, made the discovery  at the untended shooting range in a remote area west of the Angeles Forest  Highway, Roop said.  </P> <P> "He was off-duty and had gone to the range to shoot," Roop said. "Apparently,  the victims were at the range for the same purpose and it is unknown what  happened."  </P> <P> One of the victims had been shot once in the chest and the other had multiple  bullet wounds, deputies said.  </P> <P> It was unclear how long they had been dead, said coroner's spokesman Scott  Carrier.  </P></p>

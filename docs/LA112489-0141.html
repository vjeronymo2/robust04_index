			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> SWITZERLAND CALLED SOFT ON CRIME  </P> <P> A parliamentary commission accused Swiss prosecutors today of doing little to  stop drug and money-laundering international networks from pumping billions of  dollars through Swiss companies.  </P> <P> It said Swiss justice authorities were too soft on organized crime and even  failed to probe charges that Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie was using cocaine  profits to buy military hardware for Bolivia.  </P> <P> "The threat posed by organized crime has been recognized too late by the  federal prosecutor's office," the special investigative commission report said.  "The fight against international drug traders and money-laundering has been  assigned too little importance."  </P></p>

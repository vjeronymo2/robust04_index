			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by station commentator Chong Pong-kil: </F> "Direction of the Operation of So-Called State Affairs by a  Political Impostor"]    [Text] According to South Korean broadcast reports on 6  January, puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam held a so-called New Year  news conference and babbled about the direction of the operation  of so-called state affairs for the new year. However, this is  mere gibberish that contains nothing new and is completely  worthless.    Therefore, commenting on the New Year news conference by Kim  Yong-sam, the Democratic Party, a South Korean opposition party,  said: Even while saying that he would pursue  internationalization and opening up, he failed to elaborate on  concrete measures and lapsed into rosy optimism. This is very  worrisome. He merely repeated the policies he had announced  before the conclusion of the Uruguay Round negotiations.    During the news conference, traitor Kim Yong-sam said that  he  would continuously pursue change and reform and paid lip service  to politics serving the convenience of people and clean  politics. This is merely artifice to cheat the South Korean  people and constitutes an intolerable mockery of people who  demand new politics and new systems.    Even during the election campaign for the puppet presidency,  traitor Kim Yong-sam loudly babbled about clean politics and  politics where no money is necessary. However, nothing has  changed in South Korea.    The reforms that the Kim Yong-sam ring have made were  antipopular reforms which strengthened the puppet traitor's  one-man dictatorship, deteriorated the economic crisis, and  worsened people's livelihood. What the reforms gave South  Korean people were bloody suppression using guns and bayonets  and chronic hardships of life.    The Kim Yong-sam ring, under the cloak of reform, exercised  emergency arbitration power which the previous military  dictators did not dare to invoke and brutally suppressed  workers' labor disputes who called for the rights to existence.  Worse still, they viciously cracked down on the righteous  struggles of the South Korean people and students for  independence, democracy, and reunification.    The rascals, ignoring the people's demand calling for  abolition of the fascist-like National Security Law and  suppressive agencies, including the Agency for National Security  Planning, have not reformed them and, worse still, have stepped  up fascist suppression by wielding them.    Again this time, traitor Kim Yong-sam vociferated that he  would reorganize the law and systems. However this is nothing  but a trick to further step up the fascist suppressive rule over  the South Korean people. Traitor Kim Yong-sam's prattling about  sharpening the international competitive edge by pressing ahead  with the five-year plan for the new economy is also a shameless  imposture. Due to the five-year plan for the new economy, the  economy is in tatters as exports remain sluggish, the production  rate continues to drop, and foreign debts increase, backfiring  firms to go bankrupt. To make matters worse, farmers and  agriculture lost ground and the catastrophic crisis in the South  Korean economy has been deepened overall due to the Kim Yong-sam  ring's rice market opening.    Traitor Kim Yong-sam admitted that our economy is suffering  from hardening of the arteries in various places. At such a  time, how can the advertisement on enhancing international  competitiveness and so on get through to anyone?    What cannot be overlooked is that puppet traitor Kim  Yong-sam  came out with our nonexistent nuclear issue again this time.  Speaking of our nuclear issue prattled about by traitor Kim  Yong-sam, this is a byproduct of the antisocialist and  anti-Republic maneuvers persistently pursued by the United  States. It is the United States that came out with the  suspicion of our nuclear development and which threatens us by  actually bringing nuclear weapons onto the Korean peninsula.    Therefore, the nuclear issue in our country is an issue that  must be resolved through DPRK-U.S. talks, not an issue into  which the South Korean puppets should poke their noses.    As is known, in recent contacts, by displaying the spirit of  mutual understanding and cooperation, the DPRK and the United  States provided prospects for removing a series of obstacles in  the way of DPRK-U.S. talks and fundamentally resolving the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. Not only all the fellow  countrymen but also the world welcome this. However, traitor  Kim Yong-sam presumptuously babbled about the nuclear issue of  the North and provoked us. This is what only the vicious  betrayer who does not care about the destiny of the country and  the nation can do.    Envious of the fact that opportunities had been provided for  making progress in the DPRK-U.S. talks and that prospects had  been provided for fundamentally resolving the nuclear issue, the  puppet traitor made those absurd remarks in an insidious attempt  to put a brake on this development at all costs and harm and  crush [apsal] his fellow countrymen in collusion with  international reactionaries.    Babbling about the so-called provocation, traitor Kim  Yong-sam also said that he would see to modernize the puppet  armed forces and that it would be good for him not to comment on  the Team Spirit joint military exercise because it was a  sensitive issue. He made these remarks with the same intent.    Facts show that traitor Kim Yong-sam has no will to realize  reunification and intends to continuously pursue North-South  confrontation this year. It is also proven that the civilian  regime is so in appearance only and, in reality, is no different  from any other preceding dictatorial regime.    One has no reason to watch the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime or  expect something from it. Traitor Kim Yong-sam must know what  consequences his traitorous remarks and deeds harming his fellow  countrymen will bring and act with discretion.</p>

			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Quality of life 'barely above 1950' Quality of life in Britain is worse than in the mid-1970s and hardly higher than in 1950 when some goods were still rationed, says a report published today. Researchers from the Stockholm Environment Institute use consumer expenditure as the base measure for a quality of life index and adjust it by 20 factors ranging from conventional measures, such as net capital growth, to factors such as the costs of commuting and of lost farmland. The index aims to replace gross national product as a broader measure of affluence. The researchers say that 'sustainable economic welfare is not the same as GNP, and has departed from it from the mid-1970s onwards'. Their calculations suggest that, between 1950 and 1990, GNP per head grew by 230 per cent in real terms, or an average of 2.1 per cent per year. The researchers' index grew by just 3 per cent over the entire period. Since the 1970s the researchers' index has been falling at an average rate of almost 5 per cent a year. Much of the decline is accounted for by the fall in value of natural assets such as North Sea oil. In the case of measuring the cost of lost farmland, the researchers subtract a value of the land lost to urbanisation and the fall in farming productivity as the soil quality deteriorates. But even without accounting for the depletion of natural resources, the index is still at the level of the early 1970s, having almost doubled between 1950 and 1970. The researchers blame increasing inequality in the distribution of incomes. They say an income increase of Pounds 1,000 a year for a poor family means a much sharper improvement in quality of life than the same gain would for a rich one. This phenomenon is seen when the method is applied to the US, but the divergence is more marked in the UK. Measuring Sustainable Economic Welfare - A Pilot Index 1950-1990.

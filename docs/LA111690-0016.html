			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> CHARGERS;  </P> <P> SEAU INJURES GROIN IN DRILLS  </P> <P> Starting linebacker Junior Seau, who was getting additional work on his  pass-rushing technique with the Chargers' scout team, suffered a pulled groin  muscle in Thursday's practice.  </P> <P> Seau, who was limping noticeably as he walked off the field, said later he  would be examined by a team physician.  </P> <P> "It can last for six weeks, it can last for two or for one," Seau said. "We're  going to have to look at it carefully so the whole year won't be affected by  it.  </P> <P> "Not playing because you're not playing good is one thing, but not playing  because of this little piddling groin pull is another. It's just so  frustrating. There's things that need to be done, and I know it, and with this  in the way it's just another obstacle to overcome."  </P> <P> Seau had gone through defensive practice drills before his injury. If the  injury affects his playing time Sunday against the Kansas City Chiefs,  linebacker coach Mike Haluchak said Cedric Figaro will replace him.  </P> <P> "It's nice to have some depth, but I think Junior will be fine," Haluchak said.  "It's just a day-to-day thing."  </P> <P> Tight end Rod Bernstine, who alternates with Marion Butts as the Chargers'  primary ballcarrier, said he's still unable "to burst" on his injured  hamstring.  </P> <P> "I can't run full speed," Bernstine said, "but we still have a few days left."  </P> <P> Bernstine missed last week's game with the Denver Broncos and remains  questionable for the Chiefs. Coach Dan Henning, however, said it looks as if  the team might be able to get some work out of him Sunday.  </P> <P> Butts has carried the ball 175 times this season without fumbling and has not  lost the ball since last year's visit to Kansas City.  </P> <P> "We work on it a lot," he said. "The coach really pressures us to keep from  fumbling. You fumble and you're throwing away your paychecks." T.J. SIMERS  </P></p>

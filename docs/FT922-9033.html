			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: A real con artist I CANNOT claim to have been one of the late Francis Bacon's champagne claque. But I have a nice vision of the artist from someone who was. The setting of this vignette is not the Colony Rooms in London's Soho, but a Chinese restaurant in the Clerkenwell Road; and Bacon is ensconced not so much with his arty retinue as with an elite of London mobsters. I am told he got along very well with such criminals, and competed eagerly with them when it came to paying the bill for Chinese meals. He was, as he told them, enormously rich. 'Yeah,' snarled one. 'And you can't even draw a bloody dawg]' In fact, Francis Bacon may well have had difficulty in drawing a dog: he never claimed to be a realistc draughtsman. But this is not the point. In the eyes of such company at least he seemed like one of them: an arch con man, touching suckers for millions with his pictures and frittering the proceeds as would any big-time felon, on champagne and casinos. It sets me pondering about the rapport between art and criminality. Was Bacon alone in bridging the gap? The motive of playing tricks on the public has never been far away. Ancient Greek artists liked to paint bunches of grapes so luscious that people would try to grab them. They sculpted cows so motherly that young calves came up to suckle the statues. This, if you think about it, is a kind of fraudulence. Then there was that other Greek artist who, curious to study expressions of pain, subjected his models to tortures of which the Kray Brothers might have boasted. Examples of real degeneracy among great artists readily come to mind. Benvenuto Cellini was as proud of his record of GBH as his silverwork. Caravaggio was a scallywag. Most of the works of Rodin and Augustus John are the fruits of persistent sexual harassment; and as for Salvador Dali, his confessed record of malefaction is too repellent to be quoted here. It is enough to say that he was one of the most poisonous individuals this century has so far produced. There is a converse side to this. In Rome recently, I watched some pickpockets in action: gypsy children, none of them more than nine or ten years old. Their subject was a camera- and cash-laden caravanserai of Japanese tourists; their treatment of it can only be described as virtuoso. With a few deft strokes, they picked out essential details, exhibited wonderfully sensitive handiwork, and lightened the load of human existence. What more do we want from any artist? I felt like the fellow who came upon a young Giotto, scratching icons on a rock while tending his father's sheep. There was a genius in these gypsy children: they wanted a proper apprenticeship, an academy, for the full flowering of their potential. Connoisseurs of crime, of course, share much in common with the connoisseurs of art. It was always the unsigned touches of mastery that intrigued Sherlock Holmes: and his techniques for attribution were exactly the same as those currently being used by a posse of Dutchmen bent on distinguishing Rembrandts from not-Rembrandts. Trawling page three of the Daily Telegraph for first-class examples of modern mastery, I am regularly gratified to find that the aspirations to virtuosity among criminals are abundant, and no signs whatever that the English country house murder is in decline. Of course, there are plenty of untutored types about - crass daubers and desperadoes who know nothing of preliminary sketches, finishing touches, and so on, but some real craftsmen are in evidence. There are those who can capture every salient object of value in your house within a matter of minutes. Others present convincing models of pension fund managers; others create marvellous images of aristocratic lifestyles. Still others work in the chiaroscuro world of back alleys, mixing unusual powders for extraordinary leaps of the imagination; while others again prefer to shock the public by their stubborn disregard for form and decorum. To anyone who has lately been burgled or set upon, this will appear a heartless conceit. And in truth, I see only one benefit from granting artistic status to our criminals: it would be a renaissance for which the government would be given credit.</p>

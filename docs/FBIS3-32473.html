Cuban Ambassador Jose Perez Novoa said Washington's  occupation of part of the Guantanamo territory in the eastern  part of his country, against the island's will is an example of  the denial of this right.    The head of the Caribbean island's delegation to the 50th  Human Rights Commission meeting spoke for the second time in one  day to explain his position on point nine of the agenda:  self-determination and its application to peoples subjected to  colonial rule or foreign occupation.    Moreover, Cuba views the promotion of intervention disguised  as humanitarian efforts and concern for human rights as an  attempt to downplay the importance of the people's right to  self-determination.    There are sufficient arguments to prove that certain  northern  countries become concerned about the problems of others only  when they are moved by political considerations that are  entirely foreign to the essence of these rights, the Cuban  diplomat stated.    Perez Novoa said a small group of states is trying to force  the rest of the world to accept certain ideological patterns of  conduct whether they like it or not.    Perez Novoa said that countries that have been colonized and  exploited for centuries are now being forced to adopt imported  economic and political models that pose serious limitations to  their national sovereignty and therefore to the full exercise of  their self-determination. It is being done under the pretext  that such models must necessarily be applied throughout the  entire world.    According to the diplomat, he would like to see a  humanitarian intervention in one of the northern countries at  the request of a group of underdeveloped nations.    The disregard for self-determination has reached such a  point  that those who are calling for the so-called humanitarian  interventions and theories about limited sovereignty would  rather have this principle disappear from the Human Rights  Commission agenda altogether, Perez Novoa said.    He added that neither preventive diplomacy, limited  sovereignty, nor humanitarian interference would resolve the  serious problems of mankind, among which he mentioned the  inhumane conditions that lead to millions of deaths each year as  well as poverty, hunger, and illiteracy.    Imagine a world where the law of the jungle prevails, in  which manipulation and political interests prevail over the  majority of countries, denying them the right to freely decide  their future.</p>

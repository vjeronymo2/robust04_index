			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 10 Apr (EFE) -- The Great Front  center-left coalition was victorious in the federal capital in  the elections held today in Argentina to elect the 305  legislators who will reform the Constitution. The coalition  triumph, which the polls had predicted, surpassed estimates  because according to the first unofficial poll it reached  between 30-35 percent, according to several sources. The  Justicialist Party (Peronist) dropped in Buenos Aires to a  distant second with between 25-30 percent, and the UCR dropped  to between 14-15 percent.    Carlos Alvarez, Great Front candidate for the federal  capital, said that residents "voted for ethics and to warn the  government that it cannot protect those responsible for  corruption." The vote for punishment for Peronism and for the  UCR is, according to Alvarez, "a reflection of the people's  weariness and moral fatigue and who tell the government  `enough.'"    In the rest of the country the victory went to Peronism,  with  more than 40 percent, according to polls, while the UCR was  second.    [Hamburg DPA in Spanish at 2201 on 10 April reports from  Buenos Aires that the Argentine elections "ended this afternoon  normally." The item adds that "according to Buenos Aires radio  polls, about 70 percent of eligible voters participated, which  comprises 21.64 million people with a right to vote." The item  adds that the historic record shows an average voting attendance  of 80 percent.]</p>

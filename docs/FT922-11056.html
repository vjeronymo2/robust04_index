			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (7): Survivor prospers - Profile of Zbigniew Socha Of Brodnica - Anthony Robinson criss-crosses small-town Poland and finds the spirit of enterprise still very much alive and well BEFORE the Balcerowicz plan came into effect in January 1990, Brodnica, a small market town near Bydgoscz founded by the Teutonic knights in the 12th century, boasted 700 small private enterprises and shops. Only 230 still exist. But those which do have demonstrated their durability under harsh, and often unpredictable, economic and political circumstances. Zbigniew Socha, the 41-year-old owner-manager of ZSiM engineering company, is one of the survivors. After slowly building up production in a converted glasshouse full of second-hand machines behind his smart front office, he saw his order book for simple metal bending machines melt away in 1990 as customers, mainly state-owned enterprises, revoked their contracts in the face of sky-high interest rates and falling demand. After months desperately seeking new clients and new products he finally received a European Community loan to build a bakery but was unable to equip it when interest rates, linked to domestic Polish rates, rose to new highs in early 1991. In the nick of time he found a German joint venture partner and began making illuminated advertising panels, using cheap Polish labour to assemble panels from imported aluminium and plastic. He also found German and Danish partners to market his metal-bending machines throughout the EC and Scandinavia and set up a joint venture in Minsk to produce wood-cutting machinery. Now his 35-man business is divided 50-50 between panels and simple metal-bending and wood-planing machines with 70 per cent of production for export. 'But my German partners know my costs down to the nearest pfennig, and they won't let me raise my prices even though they sell at a 650 per cent mark-up,' he complains. In the long run, he is convinced that economic recovery in the former Soviet republics will provide an important market for Polish companies. But right now he concedes 'the quality of the Minsk machines is terrible. We suggested they start with 10 machines and then build up. But they decided to order enough parts from various local factories to make 1,000 machines'. When the parts came, however, nothing fitted and they could only assemble 20 working machines. 'Now I have nine people there helping to sort out the mess. I don't want to get a bad name for our products. But they kept us alive by sending cheap basic parts for the frame of our machines and that helped us to keep our costs low,' Mr Socha said. In spite of sleepless nights and long hours, Mr Socha is determined to remain an entrepreneur and be his own boss. 'I have no ambition to become a Rockefeller. This is not the time for ambitious schemes, but I do want to keep running my own small business.' What he worries about is non-payment or delayed payment from customers, the difficulty of raising credit and the unpredictable changes in government economic policy. 'What we need is a decent banking system and modest government that sets clear rules and enforces the law,' he says. 'But it is over four months since the elections and we still don't even know what the government's economic strategy is.'</p>

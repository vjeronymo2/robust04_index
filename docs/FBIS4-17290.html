			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [POSTFACTUM report: "One-Shot Action To Cut All Taxes </F> Possible in Fall"]    [Text] Aleksandr Shokhin has advised that a one-shot action  is possible in Russia in fall 1994 cutting back all taxes 10 to  20 percent which, he thinks, would considerably liven up  production. He pointed out, however, that this is possible only  if the money not to be received into the budget is made up for  from the proposed reserve standby credit ($4 billion) that may  be received as soon as in the fall.</p>

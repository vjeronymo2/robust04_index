			<p>BFN     [Text] Paratrooper landings; land, air, naval, and  engineering operations [explotacion]; and special actions will  be some of the approximately 180 practical actions within the  Vigilant 94 exercises, which the Central Army in Sancti Spiritus  will conduct.    The demonstration, scheduled for this weekend, will combine  11 basic tasks for the forces' preparation at command and troop  level, something which was previously done separately.  Participating personnel come from regular and special troops in  the Army, the Territorial Troops Militia, the Cuban  Revolutionary Navy, and the Interior Ministry Border Guard  Troops. The Vigilant 94 exercise in Sancti Spiritus will  confirm the participating structures' combat readiness and will  test the small units' ability to carry out joint actions within  the unified scouting system.</p>

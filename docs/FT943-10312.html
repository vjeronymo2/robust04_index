			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / International Company News: Schering rises 4% in first half Schering, the Berlin-based pharmaceuticals group, yesterday yesterday announced a 4 per cent rise in half-yearly group profits and expects a 5 per cent improvement for the year. Turnover for the half-year increased by 16 per cent to DM2.3bn (Dollars 1.4m) and will be 12 per cent higher for the year as a whole, totalling DM4.6bn. The results do not include results from the crop protection division which was hived off last January and placed in a separate joint venture, AgrEvo, with Hoechst, one of Germany's largest chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturers. The half-yearly group profits which totalled DM192m was lower than expected because of the decline of the dollar and sterling as well as the scraping of tax benefits and incentives offered to west German companies who were based in Berlin before German unification. In addition, Schering said the group had to make one-off payments for the rights for Betaseron, a drug used for multiple sclerosis. The group said sales of Betaseron accounted for nearly 66 per cent of its therapeutic medicine division. The division totalled DM744m for the first half of this year compared to DM546m over the first six months of 1993. Domestic sales over the same period rose by 5 per cent to DM358m, and exports rose by 18 per cent to DM1.98bn. Schering's turnover last year totalled DM5.3bn, which included the agro-chemical/crop protection division, and profits amounted to DM254m.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Information at the tip of your fingers Touch screen technology, which can detect pressure through two inches of glass, could open up new applications for shop window computer terminals. Manufactured by MicroTouch Systems, in Methuen, Massachusetts, the screens could provide after-hours information to bank customers, for example. Developed in the UK by Moonstone Designs, the screens have an electrostatic charge behind the glass. By measuring disturbance in the field the computer can calculate where the pressure was applied and then provide the information required. MicroTouch Systems: US, 508 659 9000; UK, 0844 260123.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration since:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. A significant increase in the probability or consequences of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accident previously evaluated will not occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service Water Inlet Temperature Monitoring Instrumentation be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changed from every 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating cycle has been performed. Based upon this analysis it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been concluded that sufficient margin exists between the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing Technical Specification and the licensing basis Safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Analysis to accommodate the channel statistical error resulting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from a 30 month operating cycle. The existing margin between the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technical Specification and the Safety Analysis provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assurance that plant protective actions will occur as required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is therefore concluded that changing the surveillance interval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%) will not result in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant increase in the probability or consequences of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accident previously evaluated has not been created.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change in operating cycle length due to an increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveillance interval will not result in a channel statistical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowance which exceeds the current margin between the existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technical Specification and the Safety Analysis. Plant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment, which will be set at (or more conservatively than)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technical Specification limits, will provide protective functions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to assure that Safety Analyses are not exceeded. This will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevent the possibility of a new or different kind of accident  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from any previously evaluated from occurring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. A significant reduction in a margin of safety is not involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The above change in surveillance interval resulting from an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased operating cycle will not result in a channel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statistical allowance which exceeds the existing margin between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the current Technical Specification and the licensing basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Safety Analysis. This margin, which is equivalent to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing margin, is necessary to assure that the protective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety functions occur and that the Safety Analysis limits are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not exceeded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [(11) Sampler Flow Rate Monitor:]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. There is no significant increase in the probability or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequences of an accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sample Flow Rate Monitors be changed from every 18 months (+25%)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to every 24 months (+25%).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The flow rate monitors are used to estimate the total volume of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air passed through filters. There is no setpoint or safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> function served by these monitors. A high level of radioactivity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the discharge stream is detected by R&hyph;43 and/or R&hyph;44.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Insofar as discharge via the unit vent is permissible with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitors inoperable, extension of the surveillance interval will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have no impact upon safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously analyzed has not been created.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As the nuclear safety function is provided by other monitors in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the event of high radioactivity levels in the discharge stream,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extension of the surveillance interval will have no impact upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the creation of a new or different kind of accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These flow monitors are utilized to determine the total air flow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through filters for computational purposes. As adequate measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (other monitors) exist to prevent the possibility of discharging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> radioactivity in excess of applicable limits, there is virtually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no impact upon safety incurred by extending the surveillance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [(12) Boric Acid Makeup Flow System:]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration since:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. A significant increase in the probability or consequences of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accident previously evaluated will not occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Boric Acid Makeup Flow System be revised from every 18 months  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%). A statistical analysis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> channel uncertainty for a 30 month operating cycle has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed. Based upon this analysis it has been concluded that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient margin exists between the existing Technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specification limit and the licensing basis Safety Analysis limit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to accommodate the channel statistical error resulting from a 30  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> month operating cycle. The existing margin between the Technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specification limit and the Safety Analysis limit provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assurance that plant protective actions will occur as required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is therefore concluded that changing the surveillance interval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%) will not result in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant increase in the probability or consequences of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

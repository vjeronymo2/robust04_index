			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Gold shares busy The latest upsurge in the gold price triggered further strength in South African gold shares and lifted the FT-Actuaries Gold Mines Index to its highest level since August 1991. The bullion price reached a 29-month peak at one point but came under severe pressure later after rumours that Mr George Soros, the US investor, had begun to sell. London trading in South African golds built up throughout the session, with the top quality producers such as Vaal Reefs touching Dollars 74 before retreating to trade around the Dollars 71 level. Driefontein peaked at Dollars 12 3/4 before slipping to Dollars 12 1/4 . One leading trader said there was broad demand for golds, with South African institutions buying aggressively, closely followed by Continental and US investors. London buyers were more restrained. The sudden strength in metal prices gave a further boost to Lonrho, the UK-based conglomerate with substantial interests in precious metals via big holdings in Ashanti, the Ghanaian gold mine, and Western Platinum, the South African platinum mine. Lonrho rose 2 to 116 1/2 p, its best level for more than a year. Dealers said Lonrho's recent strength was in the face of some exceptionally heavy selling. Yesterday it was announced that the Malaysian-based Genting group of companies had reduced holdings in Lonrho by around 7m shares to 38.1m. 'There has been a subtle but positive shift in the London market's view of Lonrho since the arrival of Mr Dieter Bock at Lonrho last year,' said one dealer.</p>

From Ciorbea, we have learned that he is not willing to accept  that position either, as long as the government coalition  includes the Greater Romania Party, Democratic Agrarian Party of  Romania, National Romanian Unity Party, and Socialist Party of  Labor.    As a result of this, the CNSRL-Fratia, in an almost definite  cooperation with the Alfa-Trade Union Confederation, takes over  its duties.    "On 28 February we will hold a one-day strike and it will be  seen not only in the paper or on the television," said Miron  Mitrea. "Bread factories and bread selling stores alike will  work only with a third of their capacity, refineries will be  operating but will not produce anything, oil deliveries will be  interrupted, drivers will not move from their garages, teachers  will go to classes but will not teach, and the wood processing  industry will stop its activity. The telecommunications will be  interrupted every 10 minutes, road workers will block roads, and  work will stop at construction sites. Enterprises will have  strike pickets and nobody from the outside will be allowed to  enter the factory. The idea is to prove our organizational  capability and, at the same time, to prepare the ground for our  future actions planned for March and April."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 14 January Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] A government source disclosed 13 January that Japan  and the United States had basically reached an accord at the  Japan-U.S. construction talks on Japan opening its public works  projects to foreign countries. Agreement had been reached  because the U.S. side had indicated it basically accepted the  action program suggested by the Japanese side at the unofficial  talks that started in Tokyo at the beginning of the week.    The action program looks to introduce a general competitive  bidding system for large-scale public works projects beginning  fiscal 1994. Under the program foreign companies will be  treated on equal terms as Japanese companies. The action  program will be officially approved by the cabinet meeting  scheduled for 18 January.    The two countries have also agreed to exchange data on the  number and cost of projects for which orders have been given to  foreign companies, in an attempt to measure the degree of market  opening. The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) has indicated it  will support the imposition of sanctions against Japan if no  accord is reached by 20 January. However, with agreement now  reached, it has become certain that sanctions can be avoided.    According to the action program agreed on by two countries  the scale of projects to be sponsored by the central government,  and for which the general competition bidding system will be  introduced, will be set at more than 4.5 million SDR's (special  drawing rights, approximately 700 million yen).    The level has been set at 15 million SDR's [about 2.5  billion  yen] for projects sponsored by local governments, including  prefectures and special municipalities, and the 84 state-run  corporations government, including Eastern Japan JR [Japan  Railways], Japan Highway Public Corporation, and NTT [Nippon  Telegraph and Telephone].</p>

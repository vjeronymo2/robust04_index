			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: PEOPLE WATCH  </P> <P> Dangerfield Seeks Respect in Court: A last-ditch effort by attorneys for  Caesars Palace and Rodney Dangerfield to reach a settlement in a lawsuit that  the comedian filed against the resort two years ago has ended in failure. A  trial date will be set Aug. 1. Dangerfield contends his eyes were burned in a  steam bath accident at Caesars on March 16, 1988, causing him to cancel a  series of shows at the Las Vegas resort.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Constitutionality Court will have to decide  whether it will process the appeal filed by the Supreme  Electoral Tribunal against the temporary suspension of the  election for new deputies. This issue aroused various reactions  on Monday in judicial and political circles. National Congress  President Vinicio Villar Anleu commented on the implications of  the case:    [Begin recording] [Villar Anleu] It seems to us -- and we  uphold Congress' institutional policy -- that the nation's laws  must be respected and that the Constitution must be respected.  In this case, we will obey any legal decision issued. What is  interesting is that we are not only operating under a democratic  process with a government that is respecting the Constitution,  but we are also operating under a de jure state in which the  decisions of various judicial institutions should prevail -- in  other words, the decisions of the relevant courts.    In this case, a court issued a temporary amparo, and,  because  we live in a de jure state, we must obey it. This is a  temporary amparo. A deeper analysis of the case must be made  before a definite decision is handed down. The Congress, as an  institution and as one of the three state branches, is willing  to respect and always obey the legal opinions handed down by any  court that has jurisdiction.    [Unidentified reporter] What is your opinion about the paid  advertisement by Alvaro Arzu, one of the secretaries of the  National Vanguard Party [PAN], who points out that the  corruption in Congress and...    [Second unidentified reporter, interrupting] Saying it is  responsible for the whole crisis...    [Villar Anleu, interrupting] I say what I have always said:  We respect the opinion of any Guatemalan citizen. In this  case, Mr. Alvaro Arzu, a citizen like any other, is expressing  his opinion. This opinion must be respected. As president of  the Congress, I do not share his opinion. I want to make it  clear that the deputies were elected by the people during clean,  democratic, completely legal, and crystal clear elections for a  five-year term. This term is mandated by the Constitution.    As I have said before, in the spirit of helping this  Congress, we have accepted -- after an agreement with the  executive -- moving up the legislative elections. Nevertheless,  the mandate was for five years, and in this case it was the  people who elected us. If he says there has been  irresponsibility on the part of the deputies, I would say it is  the responsibility of all, including the deputies of his party  -- that is, the PAN -- who resigned last year. They are also  responsible for any political activity taking place in the  nation. Therefore, I am sorry he has made these statements. I  do not share his opinion, but I respect it. That is his  opinion, and it must be respected. Well, when someone has money  to spend, he can publish paid advertisements.    We, as an institution, respect everyone's opinion, even if  we  do not share it. We want to make very clear our position that  we are complying with a mandate for the upcoming elections. We  will respect the agreement made with the executive; however, we  also respect the law and the Constitution. If a court issues a  decision, we will obey it because we live in a de jure state.

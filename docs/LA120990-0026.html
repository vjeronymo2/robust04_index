			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANTS;  </P> <P> AN OFFICE ROMANCE BLOOMS;  </P> <P> THE PALM COURT HAS WON OVER THE LOCAL WORKING CROWD BY DAY, BUT ITS SPLENDID  ISOLATION DRAWS FROM FAR AFIELD AT DINNER  </P> <P> Splendid isolation, you could call this. Splendid, certainly: The Palm Court is  all high ceilings and great sheets of marble and glass. It sports a reflecting  pool and, needless to say, a decent stand of palm trees.  </P> <P> But isolation, for sure. It's in the enclosed courtyard of a huge office  building, part of a regular forest of office buildings at the corner of Santa  Monica and Sepulveda boulevards. When the restaurant opened in late spring, it  was only for breakfast and lunch, two hours when it has the neighborhood office  workers pretty much to itself.  </P> <P> Recently it opened for dinner as well -- a big step, because at dinner the Palm  Court has to lure people from far away. Actually, it's not particularly remote,  only a block or two east of the San Diego Freeway (depending on whether you  count tiny Pontius Street), but a deserted business district always feels like  the far side of the moon after dark. Fortunately, the underground parking in  the Palm Court's own building alleviates the spookiness, and fortunately, the  food is worth a drive.  </P> <P> What sort of food is it? The kind that makes it hard to ignore the fact that  the Palm Court is owned by Parties Plus, the major-league catering service.  This feels like top-flight caterer's food: versatile, eclectic and serenely up  to date. Chef Rich Kitos may very well be making personal culinary statements  here, but inevitably you suspect Parties Plus' sensitive finger on the pulse of  L.A. taste.  </P> <P> To put it another way: Though it has hints of French, Japanese, Central  American and even plain old American cooking, this is basically a menu drenched  with Italian influence.  </P> <P> Apart from breakfast, that is. Breakfast caters to the usual American a.m.  ambivalence -- healthful grains or luxurious eggs? -- though in novel ways. You  can get a sort of conceptual hash: a crab cake with browned cubed potatoes and  startlingly fresh poached eggs, not mixed together but arranged side by side on  the plate.  </P> <P> For the rest of the day, this is a restaurant enthusiastically part of an age  when there must be olive oil and a basket of fresh breads at the table (here  the basket includes a delicious white bread with swirls of olive paste in it).  There must be pasta and radicchio and bufalla mozzarella on the menu.  </P> <P> But our town is not looking for Italian cuisine as such; we want all those  excellent foods, but we want them on our own terms: that is, not necessarily in  strict antipasto-pasta-entree order, and with non-Italian options and extras.  Particularly at dessert, when we prefer things French or American.  </P> <P> So at lunch there's a polenta of the day, at dinner there's a risotto of the  day. (You can get polenta at dinner as well, with a rich sauce of spinach and  Italian bacon, but it's fried polenta, like mere fried cornmeal mush; at lunch  the polenta has a light texture of unmatched tenderness.)  </P> <P> But since we want our options and extras, at lunch, the Palm Court serves  ravioli with a stuffing that includes ricotta and sun-dried tomato -- and also  goat cheese, that cheese of the age. At breakfast and dinner you can get a  pupusa, the Salvadoran cornmeal pancake stuffed with -- an Italian touch --  ricotta.  </P> <P> Oddly, given the wide influence antipasto has had on our tables, none of the  dinner appetizers seems Italian. The mussel chowder is a cousin of clam  chowder, and the soup of the day might be potato soup with bits of smoked  turkey and crunchy, barely cooked chunks of carrot and green beans. Salmon  gyoza looks like ravioli, large and flat with scalloped edges, but you taste  soy rather than butter in the sauce. The most appealing appetizer is the seared  tuna served on slices of cantaloupe sprinkled with black mustard seed, all in a  delicate Japanese ponzu vinaigrette.  </P> <P> The menu lists "antipasti," but what it calls by that name is a plate of three  sandwich-like tidbits: anchovy between slices of eggplant and roasted red  pepper, garlicky ricotta between slices of zucchini, and mozzarella between  slices of green tomato. It's Italian ingredients subjected to the  Franco-Japanese treatment rather than anything the world knows as antipasto.  </P> <P> At the same time, the entrees occasionally have the feeling of antipasti:  plates with various savory ingredients arranged together for ad lib nibbling,  combinations that neither clash nor form close harmonies. They're looser and  more casual arrangements than the marriage of flavors French chefs  traditionally aim at. I'm thinking of "salmon paillard," for which the  thin-sliced salmon is not grilled over a flame like chicken paillard, but under  it, searing it to the plate. It's topped (despite the menu's nattering about  various herbs) with baby asparagus, long spears of chives and a salad of diced  cucumber and yogurt.  </P> <P> The most attractive entree is lamb chops with rosemary, garlic, mint and basil,  with a sauce of port wine and balsamic vinegar. This sounds like one of those  dishes with about three ingredients too many, but the result is subtle and  intriguing, as if some new ingredient had been discovered -- perhaps some  unheard-of cousin of the kumquat. I'm not quite sure, however, what the fried  mashed potato patty (which the menu calls "rosti potatoes") is doing to earn  its seat on this plate. Pleasant though it is.  </P> <P> There's a straightforward and not un-Italianate stew of shellfish piled high in  a bowl and garnished with herb-flavored fritters, and a rugged peasanty dish of  roasted chicken with Calamata olives and garlic. The medallions of turkey  piccata are like a light, clean-tasting veal piccata (though the slices of  turkey, in a delicate egg batter, are rather thick), garnished with slightly  jarring sections of bitter-sweet caramelized lemon. It's a little like a  piccata with chutney. Sometimes on special there's a swordfish piccata that's  more like the traditional item.  </P> <P> And then the menu lists a couple of wild California-style leaps of faith. The  double duck breast comes in a sweetish sauce that seems to have ground onion in  it; perfectly nice, but the cornmeal crepes that accompany it are filled with  fig, suggesting ever so slightly that a Fig Newton or two has fallen into the  gravy. The grilled prime rib is supposed to come with garlic and horseradish  sauce and sundried cherries, but the reality I had was happily more down to  earth: The beef came in a meaty sauce and was topped with some roasted garlic  cloves.  </P> <P> The Palm Court continues to serve one of the best chocolate ice creams around.  Its apple pie is always huge, but the recipe has taken its time finding itself.  I've had it with a dense filling, evidently including bread crumbs between the  apple slices, and I've had it with solid masses of apple, and once I had it  with a distinct overdose of clove and nutmeg. The crust has always been fresh  and good, though, and the latest model is hard to fault.  </P> <P> There's always a brown butter tart, with a buttery, slightly chewy crust and a  seasonal fruit filling, and a chocolate mousse cake with a cherry filling that  comes in triangular slices. Neither of these stands head and shoulders above  this city's dessert crowd, but in their humble way the Palm Court's cookies do.  You get a selection that might include some chocolate cookies -- one with a  dash of mint flavor, the other with white chocolate bits in it -- and some  peanut butter cookies, possibly frosted with chocolate, and a perfect oatmeal  cookie.  </P> <P> Cookies? OK, cookies. Even when the Palm Court is being self-consciously  experimental, there's always something genial and down to earth about its food.  The main problem I see with the place is getting used to the idea of the corner  of Sepulveda and Santa Monica as restaurant territory.  </P> <P> Palm Court  </P> <P> 11111 Santa Monica Boulevard, Westwood, (213) 479-1400.  </P> <P> Breakfast 7:30-10 a.m. Monday-Friday; lunch 11:30 a.m.-3 p.m. Monday-Friday;  dinner 6-10 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday.

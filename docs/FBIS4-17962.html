			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Nikolay </F> Geronin and Mikhail Shevtsov]    [Text] Moscow, 29 Apr -- "The visit by Russian President  Boris Yeltsin to the Republic of Korea in 1992 marked the start  of our relations," Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said,  opening talks with Yi Pyong-tae, ROK national defense minister,  who is in Russia on an official visit. "We are offering South  Korea cooperation in various fields, including the military."    Yi Pyong-tae, for his part, noted that, during the flight  from Tokyo to Moscow, the South Korean delegation "crossed the  huge territory of Russia and we sensed the great potential of  your country."    As already reported, the defense ministers of Russia and the  ROK are exchanging views on the development of the situation in  Northeast Asia and, primarily, on the issue of the  nonproliferation of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula. P.  Grachev and Yi Pyong-tae will discuss ways of expanding  Russian-South Korean military cooperation. A document on mutual  understanding over measures to develop ties between the Defense  Ministries of Russia and the ROK in 1994-95 is expected to be  signed.    During his stay in Russia, the head of the South Korean  defense department will also meet high-ranking representatives  of the Russian Government and will visit miltary units and  defense enterprises.</p>

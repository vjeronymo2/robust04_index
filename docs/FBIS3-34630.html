This report was confirmed today by a high-ranking  security source, who said the murderer and three other  Palestinians, suspected of being his accomplices in the  assassination, are members of the FRC led by Sabri al-Banna,  alias Abu-Nidal. The source said that the four individuals  admitted that they are members of the FRC.    REUTER cited Brigadier General Staff Salim Salim, commander  of the judicial police, as saying that the latest investigation  into the case revealed that one of the three suspects is a  woman, who is more of a witness than an accomplice to the crime.  He noted that at first she declined to give particular  information but did so later. The judiciary will determine the  fate of each suspect. Security sources said the Palestinian  detainees have been placed under strict security guard for fear  that they might be attacked in jail.    President Ilyas al-Hirawi informed King Husayn of Jordan  last  night that the Lebanese authorities have apprehended the  Jordanian diplomat's killer. He said the law will take its  course.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wang Yong] </F>   [Text] China's largest electronics industrial and trading  group was launched yesterday to fend off possible competition  from foreign giants after the country re-enters in GATT.    The China Electronics Corporation (CEC), which covers 62  subsidiaries at home and abroad, has total assets of 7.78  billion yuan ($894 million).    ``It is impossible for small enterprises to ward off the  pressure from foreign competitors, who will be allowed easier  access to the Chinese market after the country rejoins the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT),'' said CEC  President Yu Zhongyu.    China is expected to be admitted to the world trade body  this  year.    Electronics is one of its four pillar industries along with  motors, machinery and construction.    China began operating large-scale electronics companies in  the 1980s.    But none of them have had the business capacity of CEC,  which  is expected to generate income of 5 billion yuan ($570 million)  this year.    By 2000, CEC could control 45 per cent of the domestic  integrated circuit market, 30 per cent of the VCR market, 15 per  cent of electronics switching system and 10 per cent of cellular  telephone, said Yu. Meanwhile its annual income is expected to  hit 20 billion yuan ($2.29 billion).    The company will focus on the development of  micro-electronics and telecommunications products and gradually  set up six major manufacturing and trade bases around China.    The bases could change the old structure under which many  small enterprises competed against each other.    Top government officials fear the lack of co-ordination  between domestic firms will put China's electronics market at a  disadvantage against foreign rivals which will pay lower tariffs  when the country rejoins GATT.    China's tariff level has still to be trimmed to conform to  GATT demands.    Yu said, CEC would co-operate more with international  companies in key sectors such as micro-electronics,  telecommunications, computers and systems engineering.    As Yu put it, the CEC will shoulder the construction of ten  national major projects, such as the super-scale integrated  circuits projects and mobile communication projects.    CEC is also involved in the huge task of constructing the  Three Gorges Dam.    The company will soon help organize a grand exhibition of  telecommunications products, which are to be chosen for the  Three Gorge Dam project.</p>

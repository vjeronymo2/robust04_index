			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Mussolini's granddaughter to stand as neo-fascist candidate Ms Alessandra Mussolini (above), a medical student, actress and the granddaughter of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, says she will stand as a neo-fascist candidate in April parliamentary elections. Ms Mussolini, 28, was quoted by the Milan daily Corriere della Sera as saying she would run for the neo-fascist MSI party 'because it is the party that is closest to the ideas of my grandfather'. 'I feel very close to him,' said Ms Mussolini, who is also the niece of filmstar Sophia Loren. 'It is a family tie of which I have always been very proud.' 'Until recently the word fascist was considered shameful. Fortunately that period has passed. In fact, there is now a reassessment of how much grandpa Benito did for Italy.' She will run in the election on April 5 in Naples, the home city of her mother Maria Scicolone. Benito Mussolini was dictator of Italy from 1922 to 1943 and was shot dead in 1945.</p>

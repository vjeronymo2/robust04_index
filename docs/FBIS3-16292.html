It had been preceded by two  years of evaluation, calculation, and observation of the life  and work of country people both in remote parts and in the  environs of the oblast center. This was done by Russian  specialists in conjunction with experts from the International  Finance Corporation. Its product was the Nizhniy Novgorod model  of land reform.    What are its main features? The principles of voluntary  participation by farms and peasants on the basis of their  decision to privatize land and reorganize farms; freedom of  choice, whereby farm members decide on their own sphere of  activity; and priority farm members of farms, including  pensioners, when it comes to the acquisition of property and  land. And a strong legislative base as well.    Since the beginning of the year, land auctions have been  held  in other farms in the oblast; a total of six farms in different  soil and climatic zones in the region were the pioneers. Nearly  40 kolkhozes, joint-stock companies, and sovkhozes are waiting  in line, wanting to employ the new system.    It must be said that an active quest for agrarian reform  options has been conducted of late in Tula, Moscow, and Orel  Oblasts and in other regions of Russia. Which one will provide  the foundation?    It is better to see once than to hear 100 times, as they  say.  No doubt this is what prompted V. Chernomyrdin, chairman of the  Russian Federation government; A. Zaveryukha and A. Chubays, his  deputies; V. Khlystun, minister of agriculture and food; and  leading officials of a number of Russian ministries recently to  spend a few days studying land reform on the spot, in Nizhniy  Novgorod Oblast. The leaders of nearly 40 Russian oblasts,  krays, and autonomous okrugs went to the oblast to size up the  situation. The VIP's attended an auction, held this time at the  Kolkhoz named for the 60th Anniversary of October, in  Gorodetskiy Rayon.    The subsequent discussion involving the government head, the  hosts, and the guests touched on the local land reform program  that had been presented and ways of getting the Russian  agroindustrial complex out of the current crisis. According to  V. Chernomyrdin, who attended the auction and familiarized  himself with the oblast's specific actions and plans, we are all  participating in a "major undertaking in Russia," the main aim  of which is to get owners to develop agricultural production.    Concerning the agrarian program created within the confines  of the Nizhniy Novgorod region, the prime minister noted that it  could become a national program, although it would have to be  refined by the different regions. Viktor Stepanovich also  backed the idea of creating a cadre center in Nizhniy Novgorod  to train reform specialists.    During his stay in Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast, V. Chernomyrdin  visited the "NITEL" joint-stock company and met with the leaders  of industrial and defense enterprises and oblast administration  chiefs.    A. Zaveryukha, deputy chairman of the Russian government, V.  Khlystun, minister of agriculture, and representatives of the  Finance Ministry and Land Reform Committee visited the  Chernyshikhinskiy meat-packing plant that is being constructed  in Kstovskiy Rayon and the "Rossiya" collective enterprise. The  conference with the oblast's agroindustrial aktiv that followed  discussed various agricultural production matters.</p>

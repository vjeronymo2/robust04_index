			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Arts: Today's Television Today Horizon celebrates its 30th anniversary. How has the programme managed to survive so long and acquire such kudos? Benevolent neglect? Top people at the BBC are predominantly arts graduates. Thanks to their own tastes there are more series about the arts than the sciences, and they take an active interest in the condition of the arts series. The BBC's main science programme, on the other hand, has not regularly had its roots pulled up for inspection. Consequently it has continued in the style established within weeks of its launch in 1964: a serious single-issue programme treating its audience as intelligent beings. The only cloud on the, er, horizon is a recent tendency to make programmes about sociology instead of science. Horizon - which today considers some of the scientific predictions of the past 30 years - should stick with the world of laboratories and white rats (8.00 BBC2). Later (9.00) BBC2 completes the programme begun last night, Innocence Lost, about the American who was found guilty in 1992 of 99 cases of child abuse and sentenced to 12 terms of life imprisonment.</p>

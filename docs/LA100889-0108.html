			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> POLICE PUBLISH GUIDE TO FIGHT HATE CRIMES  </P> <P> The increase in hate crimes, dramatized by burning crosses and ethnic slurs  scribbled across churches and synagogues, has prompted the San Diego Police  Department to publish a pamphlet designed to combat the crimes and record their  frequency.  </P> <P> The pamphlet, the first of its kind, is also a result of modified state codes  more clearly defining hate crimes.  </P> <P> Police documented 126 hate crimes in San Diego and 147 countywide since  November, according to John Graham, a Police Department crime prevention  specialist and co-author of the hate crime pamphlet.  </P> <P> The four-page pamphlet, released this week and available at any of the city's  10 community relations offices, tells how to identify and report a hate crime.  </P> <P> A hate crime, as defined by the California attorney general's office, "is any  act or attempted act to cause physical injury, emotional suffering or property  damage, which is or appears to be motivated, all or in part, by race,  ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation."  </P> <P> When reporting a hate crime, the pamphlet says, try to report the crime from  the scene and get a detailed description of the assailant.  </P> <P> Documentation of hate crimes began shortly after the California Penal Code was  revised early last year to include guidelines on crimes committed on the basis  of race, ethnicity, religious and sexual orientation of the victim, Graham  said.  </P> <P> Before the code was updated, Graham said police documented hate crimes under a  different category, typically vandalism or battery. With a more clear  definition of hate crimes now on the books, law enforcement agencies expect to  keep better tabs on their degree and frequency, he said.  </P> <P> In addition, those convicted of hate crimes may face extra charges, said  Graham, who constructed a scenario to illustrate his point:  </P> <P> "Say one person is swinging a baseball bat and verbally abusing another person  because of race, ethnicity or sexual orientation -- that used to be (only)  battery. Now it is a hate crime and can amount to additional charges," Graham  said. A hate crime carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a $5,000  fine.  </P> <P> Graham cautioned, however, that verbal affronts alone do not constitute a hate  crime unless they are backed up with the threat of violence.  </P> <P> "Hopefully with educating the public on what hate crimes are and how to report  them, we can improve on the percentage of people caught," Graham said, adding  that most hate-related crimes go unsolved.  </P> <P> Of the 147 hate crimes documented since November, only 12 have led to arrests,  he said.  </P></p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Trade accord vital for recovery, says OECD FAILURE to reach agreement on trade liberalisation would threaten prospects for economic recovery in the industrialised world, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development warned yesterday. Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, head of the OECD's economic department, said pressures on governments to increase protectionism represented the biggest 'downside risk' to immediate prospects for world recovery and longer term economic performance. Presenting the OECD's half-yearly economic outlook, Mr Shigehara said successful completion of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade would provide a much-needed boost to confidence at a time when the world's industrial economies were either in recession or experiencing only fitful recoveries. Agreement would 'not only encourage trade and activity, but boost confidence, as it would define the clear direction for policy in the trade area which at the moment is lacking', he said. The latest shaving of German interest rates did not alter the OECD's view that recovery in continental Europe will be delayed until well into next year unless the German authorities significantly ease monetary conditions. It believes growth in the 24 member states of the organisation will amount to only 1.2 per cent this year with high European interest rates and continued debt reduction hindering a more dynamic recovery. Mr Shigehara said 1993 would be 'the third successive year in which growth in the OECD area as a whole, at just over 1 per cent, will be unsatisfactory'. The UK is one of the few member economies forecast to show buoyant growth this year, but the OECD is not yet convinced that the government's medium term strategy for controlling inflation is sufficient to prevent a return to rapid price rises in the long term. Mr Stephen Potter, director for country studies and economic prospects, said the UK government appeared to be placing a greater emphasis on monitoring inflation than it had done in previous upswings, but on the UK's past record it was necessary to be sceptical.

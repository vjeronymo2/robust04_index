			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Germany faces row on plan to cut holiday pay LEADERS of the German government coalition yesterday hit upon a new source of cash to paper over cracks in their own unity: the holiday pay of German workers, writes Quentin Peel in Bonn. They came up with an extraordinary scheme to cut pay packets by 20 per cent on each of 10 national holidays - such sacred days as Christmas, New Year's Day, Easter Monday, May Day, and even the newly-created Day of German Unity  -in order to help pay for a new pillar of the social state. Their plan was received with instant incredulity in the labour movement, and equally dismissed by employers as irrelevant. Trade unions promised to complain direct to the supreme constitutional court. The idea behind the plan is somehow to find a way of compensating German employers for the cost of a new multi-billion D-Mark social insurance scheme, intended to finance costs of home nursing care for the old and handicapped. In itself, the scheme is highly popular, which is why Chancellor Helmut Kohl is seeking to push it through parliament before next year's elections. But he cannot find any way of funding it which meets wide approval, either within his own coalition, or across party lines, with the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD). The latest financing plan, worked out late on Monday by party experts, and agreed yesterday by leaders of the three-party coalition, is supposed to replace an earlier plan to cancel sick pay for workers for up to six days a year. That was totally abhorrent to the entire labour movement. Growth in broad money supply exceeded the Bundesbank's target range for the fifth successive month in August, the German central bank reported yesterday, writes David Waller in Frankfurt. However, the seasonally adjusted, annualised 7.2 per cent rate of growth in M3 which comprises cash in circulation as well as savings and short-term time deposits was lower than the 7.4 per cent rate in July and better than many economists predicted.</p>

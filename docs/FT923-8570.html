			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Henlys forecasts sharp recovery HENLYS Group, the motor trader and bus and coach combine, yesterday forecast 'at least break-even' for the second half of 1992 as part of its defence against a hostile bid from rival T Cowie. Following on a reduced first-half loss of Pounds 898,000 (Pounds 4.5m), that would mean an improvement of Pounds 5.9m for the whole of 1992 from a previous pre-tax loss of Pounds 6.8m. The group promised to maintain the 3p annual dividend and is holding the interim at 1p. Mr Robert Wood, chief executive, said the group's strengths were substantial. The loss-making coach and bus side was now forecast to break-even in the second half before charging Pounds 700,000 of consultancy costs. Its prospects for 1993 were 'excellent'. He said the motor division would make an operating profit of over Pounds 6m for the year, compared to Pounds 3.5m in 1991. Mr Wood also attacked Cowie's management saying its bid demonstrated 'a woeful lack of understanding of Henlys' businesses.' He said Cowie's share price had fallen from 147 1/2 p when the bid was announced. Cowie's share price closed at 119p, after going ex its 2p interim dividend, making the bid worth Pounds 22.5m. The 1-for-2 share swap values Henlys' shares at 59 1/2 apiece - they were unchanged yesterday at 69p. So far Cowie has won acceptances from holders of 0.7 per cent of Henlys shares. The feeling among Henlys shareholders is that a higher offer with a cash element would be necessary before they would accept. Cowie has until August 18 to improve its bid. Henlys said recent orders for its Plaxton's bus and coach building business totalled Pounds 26m, while an export agreement with Volvo Bus of Sweden, was expected to bring in sales of Pounds 15m a year. That compares with sales in the division in 1991 of Pounds 19.7m. Cost cutting measures saving Pounds 4.1m in a full year would be implemented by October. Mr Wood said the new orders, the deal with Volvo Bus and an agreement with trade unions had all been under negotiation for some months but had 'all come together over the last three to four weeks'. He said Volvo Bus had the option to terminate the agreement if there was a change of control of Henlys' coach building subsidiary. The interim results showed turnover down nearly 9 per cent at Pounds 166.5m. Operating profits from the motor division were Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 1.8m) and the loss from the coach and bus side was Pounds 1m (loss Pounds 1.4m). Exceptional items relating to a new range of coaches took Pounds 950,000 (Pounds 2.6m) and the interest charge was Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 2.3m). The maintained dividend plus the advanced corporation tax resulted in a transfer from reserves of Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 6.7m). Losses per share were 2.7p (12.2p).</p>

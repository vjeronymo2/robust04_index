			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikolay Krupenik] </F>   [Text] St. Petersburg May 23 TASS -- "Russia is far from  looking for momentary profits on the market of uranium raw  materials and concentration technologies as it is adhering to  the strategy of mutually beneficial cooperation and partnership.  We are prepared to work out jointly such quotas and prices  which would not infringe on the interests of any national  companies," Professor Viktor Mikhaylov, minister of atomic  energy of the Russian Federation, stated speaking at the 21st  conference "World Market of Nuclear Fuel" which opened in St.  Petersburg today.    Taking part in this regular quorum of the international  organization which is being held for the first time in Russia,  are 200 experts from 20 countries representing power engineering  companies, and enterprises producing uranium products and  nuclear fuel.    The Russian minister drew attention of participants of the  conference to the generally recognized fact that the Russian  industry possessed the sufficient potential for extraction of  uranium raw materials and its dressing. According to Viktor  Mikhaylov, capacities of these enterprises are even slightly  bigger than those of the United States, and they are much  superior to the possibilities of European plants.    At the same time the Russian minister refuted an erroneous  viewpoint that the agreement and the contract between Russia and  the United States on the utilization of 500 tons of highly  enriched uranium which within the framework of the disarmament  program is extracted and processed by Russian specialists, and  then delivered to Americans for selling under national  contracts, are capable somehow of affecting the world market  balance. The agreement stipulates specifically that the  delivered volumes of uranium should be strictly compensated by  the corresponding reduction of American diffusive enterprises'  capacities and do not deform the market, the Russian minister of  atomic power stressed.    Participants of the St. Petersburg forum "World Market of  Nuclear Fuel" which will work for two days, are discussing  problems of reforming the nuclear power industry on a world  scale with due consideration for the development of atomic power  stations in countries of Europe and the south-east Asia, and  Russia's appearance on world markets of uranium fuel.</p>

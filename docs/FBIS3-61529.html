Palladin at  the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, Kiev; UDC  612.822.2.014.46:615.221]    [Abstract] A lack of clear understanding of the specific  role of the inhibitory system in the GABA-ergic system  involvement in the development of neurological diseases  manifested in seizures and paroxysms and a lack of data on  whether the pre- or postsynaptic system participates in the  mediated effect of NAD on the GABA-ergic transmission whereby  nicotinamide competes for the benzodiadepin binding segments  through NAD and reinforces the GABA-ergic system prompted an  attempt to answer these questions. To this end, an experiment  was carried out on 120-150 g male rats which were injected with  nicotinamide intraperitoneally based on a 150 mg per 1 kg ratio  twice a day for one week. Corazol was administered to control  animals or against the backdrop of 30 mg/kg nicotinamide  injection 50 s prior to decapitation. The experimental procedure  is outlined. The NAD and _g_-aminobutyric acid (GABA)  concentration in the rat brain cortex, the effect of NAD on the  dynamics of [.sup]14[/]C-GABA binding by control animal  synaptosomes, the effect of NAD on the dynamics of [.sup]14[/]  C-GABA binding synaptosomes after a corazol  injection, and the curve of [.sup]14[/]C-GABA release by the  synaptosomes are plotted. The findings show that  convulsion-inducing drug injection to intact animals leads to a  NAD and GABA level decrease by 23 and 20% even 50 s after  the  start of seizures whereby this effect is not observed after the  additional nicotinamide injection. The study reveals and NAD  concentrations triggering the inhibitory effect on GABA  accumulation by the synaptosomes have no effect on GABA release.  The conclusion is drawn that systematic administration of  nicotinamide accompanied by an increase in the NAD and GABA  level helps to restore the postsynaptic inhibitory effect of  GABA under stress. Moreover, the effect of NAD on the GABA-ergic  transmission is primarily realized at the postsynaptic level  according to data on the impact of NAD on the inhibitory  neurotransmitter binding and release systems.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry press service  reported that Karolos Papoulias, the foreign minister of Greece,  which is the EU president for the current year, invited the  Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov to visit Athens for a  briefing on the situation in the [Azerbaijani] Republic.    In his letter to his Azerbaijani counterpart, Mr. Papoulias  said: I hope that your visit to Athens will enable the EU to  have a more profound understanding of problems related to  Nagorno-Karabakh, and raise the ties between our countries to a  new level of development.    Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov met Belgian Vice  Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mr. Willy Claes, who was the  EU president for 1993, in Brussels last December and had  expressed his desire to address EU members on situation in  Azerbaijan. Gasan Gasanov also noted that in view of the fact  there is no satisfactory information about Azerbaijan in the  West and most of the time the existing information is not  objective, the EU should use all its possibilities productively  to obtain first-hand information. This proposal of the  Azerbaijani foreign minister was examined by the relevant EU  organs and approved.</p>

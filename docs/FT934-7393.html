			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / International Bonds: Two German states launch 30-year Eurobonds THE long end of the D-Mark sector of the international bond market looked yesterday in danger of becoming saturated as two more German states launched 30-year Eurobonds. The states of North-Rhein-Westphalia (NRW) and Rheinland-Pfalz raised DM500m and DM200m respectively through offerings priced to yield 71 or 72 basis points over 10-year German government bonds. The yield spreads on yesterday's offerings reflected the spread on Baden-Wurttemberg's DM750m 30-year Eurobond issue which was launched earlier this week and which kicked off the recent rush of long-dated bonds by German states. Some syndicate managers said that the yield spreads on yesterday's offerings should have been around 80 basis points since demand for long-dated bonds appeared to be slowing. Goldman Sachs, the joint lead manager of NRW's offering, said that although NRW had a notionally weaker rating of AA plus compared with Baden-Wurttemberg's triple-A, the spread was justified by the fact that it was Germany's most populous state and its name was well-known with investors. Issuance in the D-Mark sector is expected to remain brisk for the next week. Japan's Export-Import Bank is believed to be seeking to raise at least DM500m through an offering of 10-year Eurobonds. However, syndicate managers said that it could be difficult for the borrower to achieve its funding target of 10 basis points below dollar Libor. Issuance in the Eurodollar sector remained buoyant yesterday as the Kingdom of Sweden returned to the market with a Dollars 300m offering of three-year Eurobonds. Lead manager Paribas said that Sweden's bonds injected fresh supply into the short end of the Eurodollar market where spreads had tightened dramatically due to the dearth of new issues. GECC's bonds, for example, were now yielding 10 basis points below US Treasuries which compared with a launch spread of 10 basis points over US Treasuries. There was also a spate of dollar floating-rate notes which appealed to investors who believed US interest rates could start to rise in the new year. Two Argentine corporate borrowers are due to come to the Eurobond market in the next few weeks. Gas Argentino, the holding company for 70 per cent of the shares in the privatised MetroGas, is expected to raise Dollars 130m through an offering of five-year Eurobonds. The bonds, which have a call option in the fourth year, also allow the holders to participate in the profits of MetroGas. The bonds are likely to be priced to yield around 350 basis points over US Treasuries. Chemical Bank is arranging the offering. Sociedad Comercial del Plata, a diversified Argentine company, is scheduled to raise Dollars 80m through an offering of five-year Eurobonds, via Paribas.</p>

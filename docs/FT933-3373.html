			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Promoting retailing to new frontiers - Maggie Urry considers the background to the proposed flotation of Allders ALLDERS, the department store and duty free retailer, is likely to have a market value of Pounds 150m when it floats on the stock market this autumn. The group is expected to raise between Pounds 75m and Pounds 95m in new money, which will largely repay its debts of about Pounds 90m, net of cash. Mr Harvey Lipsith, the chief executive, said the objective was to secure a more stable and sustainable financial structure and pave the way for future growth. He said Allders was not being pushed to float by investors keen to sell. The timing was decided by a combination of factors, such as a significantly improved trading performance in 1993, against 1992, the group's view of the trading outlook and the current level of the stock market. The float, announced yesterday, is expected to be timed after Allders' financial year end of September 30, so that an estimate of 1993 profits will be included in the prospectus. Schroders is sponsoring the issue. Analysts at James Capel, the stockbroker handling the float, are forecasting an operating profit of Pounds 21.5m for the year, before one-off charges, which compares with Pounds 9.8m in 1992, when profits were hit by Pounds 3.7m of store opening costs. Allders has been planning to float ever since it was formed by a leveraged buy-out from Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, in 1989. Hanson had bought the business as part of its acquisition of UDS, the retail group, in 1983. Mr Lipsith, already at Hanson when Allders was acquired, led the buy-out and shortly afterwards recruited Mr Tony Collyer, the finance director from Arthur Andersen, the accountants. Four years of recession since the buy-out delayed the float, although it is still within the three-to-five year timetable originally envisaged. The expected flotation value of Pounds 150m can be set against a price of Pounds 224m paid to Hanson. But the figures are not comparable, and original equity investors are expected to see a reasonable return on their money. Hanson has a 5 per cent stake. Part of the finance for the buy-out came from a Pounds 40m loan from Hanson, which was due to roll-up into a Pounds 80m repayment in 1994. Tough trading conditions and looming debt repayments led to a refinancing in 1991. That allowed Allders to buy back the Hanson debt for Pounds 5m, delay repayments on other loans, and extract a further Pounds 10m of equity capital from investors who had originally put up Pounds 50m. More than Pounds 30m of bank debt has been repaid, and Pounds 50m invested in the business. Recession may have affected trading and necessitated a refinancing, but it has not stopped Allders from developing the group. The department store and duty free sides of the business are run as distinct activities. They each contribute roughly half of turnover, and at the bottom line, the profit contribution is also about the same. The department store operation is the fourth largest in the UK, but it is in a fragmented market. Two department stores were opened in 1992, taking the total to 12, but no further new stores are planned as the recession has finally brought to an end the surge of shopping mall developments which generally include a department store. However, Mr Lipsith is prepared to acquire some of the 200 or so small independent department store companies. Allders has also opened six out-of-town stores under the name At Home With Allders, offering the household ranges, in the last two years. Despite the recession, these stores have performed well and more will be developed. Allders' bias towards the south east of England, and its heavier dependence on household goods than fashion, were bad news in the recession. Investment in systems over recent years has improved productivity and efficiency. Mr Lipsith scorns the notion that 'department stores are the dinosaurs of retailing'. He believes that Allders has greater scope to bounce back than other department stores. If department stores are the stable part of the business, duty free has been more volatile. Allders is the second largest duty free retailer in the world, after Duty Free Shoppers, a US company which largely trades in the Pacific region. It has 128 outlets, including shops on the QE2 liner, and airports from Melbourne to San Francisco to London. These shops are usually run under short-term contracts regularly put up for retendering. They are dependent on the number of air travellers, which can be suddenly depressed at times such as the Gulf War. However, air travel is forecast to grow rapidly in the longer term. Allders' 1992 profits were depressed by the loss of one large contract, the shop at Sydney airport where it was outbid when the contract came up for renewal after 12 years. Allders claims a generally good track record in winning renewals. A recent deal with BAA, which operates seven airports, including Heathrow and Gatwick, should bring greater certainty to the duty free profits. Allders' shops in BAA airports represent about half its duty free turnover and the agreement will give it security of tenure until 1999 while changing the method of payment to reduce Allders' risk, and increase its incentive to drive profits higher. It is also negotiating a 25 year lease on its important Toronto airport shops. With the duty free business becoming less volatile, and prospects for recovery in the department stores, Allders can expect a warm reception when it comes to market.</p>

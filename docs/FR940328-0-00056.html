			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FSIS proposed that safe handling instructions may appear anywhere on the label where they would likely to be read. The proposal also required the safe handling instructions to be set off by a border and to one color type printed on a single color contrasting background. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FSIS proposed to exempt products intended for further processing by an inspected establishment from mandatory safe handling labeling requirements. Since products for further processing by another Federal or State establishment will not be available to consumers or food service institutions, FSIS did not believe that it was necessary to require safe handling instructions on such packaging. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FSIS proposed to allow safe handling instructions to be added to labels by the manufacturer and to be approved under the provisions of generic label approval since the regulations prescribe the exact language of the safe handling instructions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FSIS Hearing Clerk received 60 comments on the proposed rule. Commenters included consumers, representatives of consumer and other interest groups, State meat and poultry inspection officials, representatives and associations of retail stores, representatives and associations of official meat and poultry establishments, two U.S. Department of Agriculture Agencies, and others. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following discussion of comments follows the general structure of the proposed rule. General concerns are addressed in the context of specific features of the rule. Where the concerns cannot be logically addressed in the context of specific sections of the rule, they are presented under a ``Miscellaneous Issues'' section. Changes made in the final rule are described so that it is apparent how they address the concerns of commenters. Where the Agency addresses the meat regulations, conforming changes are also made in the poultry regulations. Any changes unique to either the meat or poultry regulations are identified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Miscellaneous Issues <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that the comment period should be extended and that additional information that FSIS used in formulating and supporting the regulation should be placed on the regulatory record. We disagree with this comment and not that FSIS had made publicly available, as part of this rulemaking proceeding, all relevant data upon which the regulation is based, including: the August 16, 1993 interim rule and all comments received in response thereto; the studies referenced in the interim rule; the October 12, 1993 final rule; questions and answer papers formulated in response to questions raised by the interim rule; the November 4, 1993 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and all comments received in response thereto; all studies referenced in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, including the Focus-Study Research and Agricultural Outlook (June, 1993); and documentation of oral presentations made in the course of the rulemaking proceeding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

(``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On March 30, 1994, the Exchange submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change in order to increase the minimum size of agency crosses that would be entitled to priority under this proposal from 10,000 to 25,000 shares. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See letter from Geraldine M.

The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, Amex, and at the Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange proposes to add new Commentary .02 to Rule 126(g), to allow a member who has an order to buy and an order to sell 25,000 shares or more of the same security, where neither order is for the account of a member or a member organization, to cross those orders at a price that is at or within the prevailing quotation without the transaction being broken up at the cross price. Thus, the member's bid or offer would be entitled to priority at such cross price, irrespective of pre-existing bids or offers at that price. The proposal, therefore, is intended to facilitate execution of agency cross transactions on the Exchange. In addition, confining the proposed size priority threshold to block size orders of 25,000 shares or more would limit the effects of the rule primarily to actively traded, liquid securities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The member would be required to follow the crossing procedures of Rule 151 and make a public bid and offer on behalf of both sides of the cross. However, unlike existing block cross procedures under Rule 126(g), Commentary .01, <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  such an order would not be required to be on parity with other orders on the Floor; that is, it would not be required that the priority of earlier bids and offers first be removed, by means of a sale, before effecting the cross.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> infra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , note 3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal furthers the important auction market principle of price improvement by allowing another member to trade with either the bid or offer side of the cross transaction to provide a price that is better than the proposed cross price; however, the other member could not trade with the cross bid or offer at a price which is the same as the cross price. The member who is providing a better price to one side of the cross transaction would be required to trade with all other market interest having priority at that price before trading with any part of the cross transaction. A transaction effected at the cross price in reliance on Commentary .02 would be printed as ``stopped stock.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To avoid conflict with the proposed agency cross rule, Commentary .01 of Rule 126(g) would be amended so as to afford size precedence to orders to cross 25,000 shares or more only when members or member organizations are involved as principal on one or both sides of the cross. As is currently the case, such orders to cross would be entitled to precedence only when they are on parity with other orders on the Floor. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Specifically, the Amex proposal would clarify that, in order to claim size precedence, both sides of the cross must be represented at the specialist's post when a sale clearing the Floor takes place.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Statutory Basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objective(s) of Section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

The FAA is publishing an index by order number, a subject-matter index, and case digests that contain identifying information about the final decisions and orders issued by the Administrator. These indexes and digests will increase the public's awareness of the Administrator's decisions and orders and will assist litigants and practitioners in their research and review of decisions and orders that may have precedential value in a particular civil penalty action. Publication of the index by order number, as supplemented by the subject matter index, ensures that the agency is in compliance with statutory indexing requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> for further information contact: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Daniel J.

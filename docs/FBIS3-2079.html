The leader said: The central authorities' policy decision on  strengthening and improving macroregulation and control is  entirely necessary and correct. Nevertheless, the task of  solving outstanding contradictions and problems is still quite  arduous. Some advances have been made in controlling the scale  of investment in fixed assets and readjusting the investment  structure in the previous stage. However, overall, the action  we have taken in this regard is very limited. Those projects  which ought to be suspended or postponed have not been suspended  or postponed. Problems such as an overexpanded scale of  production and an overextended construction front still exist.  If this situation continues to develop, this will be  detrimental to both the local and overall situations. This  being the case, all localities and departments must genuinely  unify their thinking and actions on the central authorities'  major policy decision on strengthening and improving  macroregulation and control; take resolute and powerful measures  to solve problems in fixed assets investment; seriously examine,  check, and prioritize the projects under construction; and  effectively ensure that funds are concentrated on key projects.    The leader said: It is necessary to put newly launched  projects under strict control, effectively strengthen the macro  management of real estate and development zones, earnestly and  comprehensively screen real estate companies of all types, and  stipulate that the government will withdraw land from real  estate companies whose development capital is less than 25  percent of their land purchase funds or sell their land within a  year, they are prohibited from selling their land if their  development capital is less than 20 percent of the land purchase  funds, and, in future, in commercial developments by real estate  companies, the proportion of residential housing units with  minimal profits should not be less than 20 percent of the total.  Efforts should be made to standardize the source of  independently raised investment funds and strengthen supervision  of the use of foreign loans. At present, a considerable amount  of independently raised funds has exceeded the ceiling set by  previous stipulations concerning the source of independently  raised funds. A strict definition should be made to standardize  the source of independently raised funds. Taking on foreign  loans should be approved, and it is necessary to expedite reform  of the investment structure and pay close attention to  investment legislation.    According to another news report, the State Council recently  made clear that the power to make industrial policy is that of  the State Council, and the State Planning Commission is the  relevant industrial policy management department specifically in  charge of the study, formulation, and implementation of  industrial polices. Other relevant departments in charge of  comprehensive economic management and specialized departments  also shoulder corresponding responsibilities, and departments  concerned and localities should coordinate with them in many  ways.    A State Council leader said: In the new situation, to do a  good job of industrial policy, it is first of all necessary to  have a firm grasp of the overall situation and stress the main  points. Efforts should be made to comprehensively develop  agriculture, strengthen the construction of infrastructure and  basic industries, and invigorate the four pillar industries of  machinery and electronics, the petrochemical industry, auto  manufacturing, and the building industry. Next, it is necessary  to have a clear picture of the market, meet the needs of the  market, guide the market, and regulate and control the market.  All sides concerned should coordinate with each other in this  regard under unified policy decisions. Finally, it is  necessary to strengthen standard basic rules and regulations.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Battle for Sarajevo continues SERB forces resumed their bombardment of Sarajevo yesterday and street battles flared again in the Bosnian capital where many of the 300,000 encircled residents, including Serbs, face starvation, Reuter reports from Belgrade. Fighting broke out towards midday after Serb forces held their fire during the night, regrouping after suffering their first setback in a two-month siege. Residents described the renewed fighting as intermittent shelling, less intense than on Monday when Sarajevo's Moslem and Croat defenders, defying a two-month siege by Serb irregulars, staged their first counter-offensive after three days of blistering Serb bombardments. The fighting left streets littered with bodies and rubble and handed the Serb irregulars ringing Sarajevo their first setback. Unofficial estimates said dozens of people were killed and more than 350 wounded. Moslem and Croat forces yesterday fought to hold positions seized from Serb irregulars in Vraca, Vidikovac and Zuc, one of the main positions for firing artillery, rockets and mortars at Sarajevo. Local journalists said there was fighting around Nedjarici, with the Moslem and Croat defence forces trying to push towards the Serb-held airport. Military observers and diplomats said it was not possible to tell how many fighters were in the hills or in the city. They said there were certainly more than 20,000 on each side waging what appears to be the key battle of the Bosnian conflict.</p>

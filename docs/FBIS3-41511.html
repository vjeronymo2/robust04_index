Economic development, population growth, and higher  consumption levels mean our country faces the threat of a global  environmental problem. Moreover, with the increased degree of  development and urbanization, as well as the development of  village and town enterprises, environmental pollution and  ecological damage accompanying our economic development have  increasingly become an important factor actually obstructing our  economic and social development.    In 1993, the World Environmental Day meeting and award  ceremony for the world's ``top 500'' were held in Beijing. The  event attracted worldwide attention for China's environmental  protection.    In environmental protection, China has always been in the  front ranks of developing countries.    Many of our achievements have gone down in the history of  civilization:    -- Ecological agriculture has spread across the country,  with  the establishment of several thousand ecological agriculture  experimental units of various types and size. As early as the  beginning of the 1980's, China stopped the production of  insecticides with strong poisons and high residue. The  agricultural department began experimenting on pollution-free  production and made new progress in afforestation on plains and  along coastal regions. In particular, the shelter-forest project  in the northeast-north-northwest region is known as ``the  world's best ecological project.''    -- Success has been achieved in preventing industrial  pollution. A large number of industrial pollution control  facilities built in our country in the 1980's have successively  yielded results, raising the rate of disposal of three wastes  [waste gas, waste water, and industrial residue], as well as the  up-to-standard rate, remarkably.    -- China's urban environmental situation has improved  remarkably. As a result of the comprehensive efforts to improve  the environment, the environmental quality of many cities has  become better to varying degrees. Despite large increases in  the urban population and energy consumption, urban atmospheric  conditions have basically not worsened and the amount of some  pollutants in the atmosphere have even decreased, thanks to  various urban air pollution control measures.    China's environmental protection has unique features, which  have attracted the attention of the Third World.  <H3>  Our Country Still Faces Grim Environmental Protection  Prospects At a Time of Rapid Economic Development </H3>   According to relevant departments, our country should  soberly  assess its current status of environment protection, despite its  tremendous achievements in preventing and controlling industrial  pollution. In the past year, some newly-launched projects,  especially ``wholly or partly foreign-owned'' construction  projects in development zones, continued to develop new  pollution sources because they failed to strictly implement  relevant state regulations mandating environmental impact  assessments, and the ``simultaneous construction of projects and  facilities to control three wastes.'' Pollution in village and  town enterprises worsened with each passing day, and the general  level of industrial pollution increased.    In 1992, 36.6 billion tonnes of waste water was released  across the country, up 9 percent from 1991; this figure does not  cover village and town enterprises. The amount of waste water  released last year was significantly higher than that discharged  in the preceding year. Although the water quality in the main  course of the Chang Jiang is good, pollution is quite serious  near the river banks in sections that run through the major  cities of Chongqing, Wuhan, Nanjing, and Shanghai. Only 41  percent of the 38,000 km stretches of the seven major rivers and  inland rivers subject to water quality tests measure up to  first- and second-class water quality standards, whereas 48  percent indicate fairly serious pollution. Surface water  pollution is serious in the cities, with the river stretches in  80 percent of the cities suffering varying degrees of pollution.  Statistics on 67 cities show that the annual and daily average  levels of suspended atmospheric particles in approximately half  of those cities exceed the limits. The annual and daily average  levels of sulfur dioxide in 13 cities exceed secondary state  limits.    Our country's ecological problems also cannot be neglected.    The devastating sandstorm that erupted in the northwest on 5  May 1993 left 85 people dead and 31 missing. Once again, we  were given a warning of ecological destruction.    The entire country is suffering from grassland degradation,  desertification, salinization, and alkalinization. The illegal  occupation and utilization of farmland has yet to be completely  halted.    Soil erosion is serious. A recent survey shows that 1.93  million square km [sq km] and 1.88 million sq km of land is  affected by water and wind erosion, respectively. A sandstorm  danger line totaling 10,000 li has been formed in northwest,  north, and northeast China. Approximately one-third of the  country's land is threatened by sandstorms, and more than 60  percent of impoverished counties in our country are concentrated  within this line. Economic losses from sandstorms reach 4.5  billion yuan annually.  <H3>  The Entire Country Was Buffeted by the Environmental  Protection Wave in 1993 </H3>   Last spring, the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC]  decided to create an Environmental Protection Committee. Never  before had our country set up environmental protection  committees under both the government and the NPC.    On 27 May, the State Environmental Protection Bureau  released  the names of 3,000 key pollution-causing enterprises in an  attempt to encourage enterprises to control pollution. Unlike  in the past when enterprises were allocated ``spots'' in order  of their output value, profits, and taxes, they were listed  according to the amount of effluents. Some of the large and  medium enterprises which had previously been considered  ``efficient'' were on the list. The move caused quite a stir  throughout the country.</p>

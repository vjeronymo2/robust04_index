			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / World Trade News: US-UK battle puts airline at risk THE future of a small Caribbean airline is being threatened by the dispute between the US and the UK over liberalising air services between the two countries and the proposed British Airways acquisition of a 44 per cent stake in USAir. Cayman Airways, the national carrier of the UK Caribbean dependency, has warned it risks going out of business unless it secures relief from what it regards as excessive competition from US airlines on the Miami-Grand Cayman route. It wants the UK to resume negotiations with the US to limit US flights from Miami to Grand Cayman from four to three services a day. Negotiations between the two countries broke down this year after the UK rejected US demands for greater access to the UK market in return for dropping one daily service to Grand Cayman. The UK dependency is now urging the UK government to offer new concessions to US airlines to clear the way for an agreement on limiting US flights to the Cayman Islands and safeguarding the future of Cayman Airways. US carriers have recently intensified pressure on their government to negotiate new rights for more US airline services to London and regional UK airports. They have asked their government to block BA's proposed alliance with USAir unless they can secure these additional rights. In turn, the UK has defended the BA-USAir deal and refused to grant US airlines greater access into the UK unless UK carriers gain more access to the US. Cayman Airways has complained that the UK appears to feel a giant carrier like BA needs more protection from US competition than the tiny Cayman Airways, which operates a fleet of four Boeing 737 jets. After showing a small operating profit in 1989, Cayman Airways has seen its losses grow as US airlines have stepped up competition on the Miami-Grand Cayman route. The airline lost Dollars 2.6m (Pounds 1.31m) in 1990, Dollars 8.6m last year and Dollars 9.2m for the 12 months ended last June. Price Waterhouse has declared the airline insolvent. It has continued to be propped up by large cash infusions from the Cayman Islands government with a subsidy, in the latest year, equivalent to 10 per cent of the Cayman Islands government's entire budget. The government says it can no longer sustain such support. Ansett, the domestic Australian airline owned jointly by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and Australia-based transportation company TNT, has forged marketing links with British Airways, United Airlines, Cathay Pacific and All Nippon Airways, AP-DJ reports from Sydney. The arrangements replace a marketing agreement between Ansett and Qantas Australia's government-owned international carrier.</p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Technology: Flights of fancy put safety first - Increasingly sophisticated aircraft simulators are becoming more like the real thing Flying conditions around Seattle were far from ideal on the last day of May. The area was blanketed with snow and a strong wind was gusting as the pilot lined up his Boeing 777 for a tricky landing at the aircraft maker's airfield on the outskirts of the city. The aircraft descended steadily towards the parallel beads of runway lights blinking in the distance. But just before touchdown, green-grey patches of ice became visible on the tarmac. Some of the aircraft's tyres failed to grip the surface. The nose lurched from side to side as the pilot struggled to bring the aircraft to an unsteady stop. This story has some obvious flaws. The chances of finding snow in Seattle on May 31 are almost zero. What is more, the twin-engined Boeing 777 has yet to fly. Its maiden flight is expected to take place within the next few days, with customer deliveries due to start only in May 1995. But Boeing's test-pilots have been notching up flying hours on the 777 for the past six months thanks to a simulator at CAE Electronics' factory in Montreal. Without leaving the ground, the pilots have flown in and out of airports around the world, experiencing the sights, sounds and turbulence of snowstorms, thunderstorms, air pockets and almost every other flying condition. CAE Electronics, a division of CAE of Toronto, claims a 50 per cent share of the world market for aircraft simulators, including 10 of the 13 orders placed so far for Boeing 777 devices. The other three 777 orders have gone to CAE's main rival, Rediffusion, a UK-based division of Thomson, the French electronics group. Like the aircraft they reproduce, simulators have grown increasingly sophisticated. Pilots' experience on a simulator now helps decide which systems and instruments are installed in a new aircraft. 'We fly our simulators before Boeing flies its planes,' says Adrian Gale, CAE Electronics' marketing director. 'We'll pick up bugs on an avionics sweep before Boeing does.' But the technological advances have one drawback: as the simulator experience gets closer to the real thing, so does its price. One of CAE's full-flight simulators currently costs about CDollars 15m (Pounds 7.2m) to Dollars 20m. As a result, airlines are turning to simplified versions, known as flight training devices (FTDs). These recreate specific parts of an aircraft's system without the frills and thrills of a real flight. For instance, maintenance system trainers, comprising little more than two chairs, two computer screens and a console, reproduce only those instruments needed for engineers to diagnose an aircraft's inner workings from the cockpit. Full-flight simulators, which look like windowless space capsules, do much more than reproduce an aircraft's cockpit and instruments. Hydraulically-powered struts which form the base of the simulator can propel the bulbous module in six directions, including a pitch and roll of up to 30'. Simulator makers go to extraordinary lengths to make flights on their machines as close to the real thing as possible. One of CAE's helicopter simulators is fitted with a shaking pilot's seat as well as the normal banking, pitching and rolling mechanisms. By pumping air into cushions behind and underneath a fighter pilot's seat, CAE mimics the G-forces felt in steep climbs and tight turns. Take-offs and landings feature appropriate real-time bumps and engine sounds. The biggest advance in recent years, however, has been in the computer-generated visual systems which project images of airports, landmarks, scenery and weather conditions likely to be encountered during a flight. The latest version of CAE's Maxvue visual system, installed in the 777, has five separate channels giving a total horizontal field of vision of 210' and a vertical field of 40'. The pilot and co-pilot can thus see true-to-life images out of all the cockpit windows. When taxiing, for instance, they can see another aircraft approaching from the side. The vertical view allows them to see slightly above and below the plane, which is especially useful in banking manoeuvres. CAE has fitted its helicopter simulators with two extra channels to give a straight-down view. CAE has developed visual-system databases for almost 40 airports around the world. Each one, taking up 5 gigabytes of disk storage, reproduces the topography and landmarks within a 15-mile radius of the airport and, in much greater detail, its runways and terminal buildings. The database is compiled from digitised satellite and aerial photos and maps. These are augmented with on-the-spot observations by the software experts who design the system and suggestions from the pilots who will use it. Few details have been forgotten. The wind sock at the end of the runway in Hong Kong billows in the same direction as the wind registered on the cockpit instruments. The rotors of a hovering helicopter churn up the sea below. But computer-generated scenery has its limitations. CAE has yet to master three-dimensional imaging, and the sharpness of the pictures does not match the human eye. Although the number of polygons (or shapes) which can be fitted on each channel has jumped from 1,000 to about 5,500 in the past three or four years, this is still not enough to cover every detail. Customers thus have to make choices. The criterion, often a subjective one, is what is of most importance to the pilot. As the Boeing 777 descends over Seattle, the city's Space Needle tower and the main highways are clearly visible from the cockpit. But there are no cars on the roads. The scene may be surreal, but it is a comforting reminder that no matter how bad the weather conditions outside, this flight will be landing safely.</p>

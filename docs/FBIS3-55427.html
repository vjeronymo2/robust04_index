Both  bankers and law enforcement agencies are worried at this  development. They want to know how the new banknotes, which  were printed in Canada and, supposedly, kept securely under lock  and key, turned up on Zaporozhye's black market. By all  accounts, the black marketeers already know what the exchange  rate for the new currency will be.    One hryvna is being exchanged for 24,000 karbovantsi, only  50  percent less than the U.S. dollar.</p>

			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: NON-ADDICTIVE PRUNE JUICE SAFE DAILY LAXATIVE OPTION  </P> <P> Question. Is it safe to drink prune juice every day to stay regular? Can a  person become addicted to it?  </P> <P> Answer. People have asked about addiction to lots of things -- sleeping pills,  nose drops, coffee and sedatives -- but this is the first time anyone has ever  asked about prune juice. Although we counsel against overuse of laxatives, we  can't imagine anyone getting into trouble with prunes.  </P> <P> The "funny" fruit is high in vitamins A and B-6, potassium, magnesium and  fiber. You may not need to drink prune juice more than once or twice a week to  stay regular, but there is no evidence that a daily dose of prunes is harmful.  That's not true of many laxatives, herbal or otherwise.  </P> <P> Q. I read about Wellbutrin in a medical newsletter two years ago. They said it  is supposed to enhance sexual desire. But my doctor says he has never heard of  it.  </P> <P> I know doctors sometimes prescribe estrogen for women with low libido, but I  had cancer several years ago and can't take any form of estrogen.  </P> <P> Please tell me if Wellbutrin is available and how well it works. I believe it  could be a great help for a woman like me.  </P> <P> A. Wellbutrin (bupropion) is a new antidepressant that works differently from  conventional medications. It is less likely to cause drowsiness, mental  confusion and constipation. Instead of weight gain, Wellbutrin may actually  lead to weight loss.  </P> <P> One unique "side effect" that has been reported with Wellbutrin is an increase  in sexual interest. This reaction needs further study, however, and the company  denies that the drug is an aphrodisiac.  </P> <P> Because the drug does have the potential to cause adverse reactions, including  nausea, headache, tremor, insomnia, jitteriness and occasionally seizures, it  should not be used casually.  </P> <P> Q. I would like to use a motion-sickness drug such as Antivert or Dramamine on  trips. The label states, however, "Avoid use in case of enlarged prostate."  </P> <P> I don't see the connection. What would Dramamine do to a man with prostate  enlargement?  </P> <P> A. Such medications can cause difficult or painful urination. You and other men  with enlarged prostates are especially susceptible. In the worst case, you  could find your bladder full but be unable to empty it, a urinary emergency  that sometimes requires catheterization.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Yuriy Sizov, Vladimir </F> Malyshev, and Yuriy Malinov]    [Text] Kerkira (Corfu), 24 Jun -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin called the agreement on partnership and cooperation  between the Russian Federation and the European Union a document  of tremendous historical importance that had made it possible to  take a decisive step toward restoring the unity of the European  continent. He was speaking here today at the signing of the  document with the leadership of the European Union. In the  agreement, according to the Russian leader, the conditions and  stages were precisely and clearly spelled out for Russia's  return to economic Europe, moreover, "as an equal partner," as  Yeltsin particularly stressed. This weighty document, comprising  over 80 pages and 10 sections, had been prepared by expert  specialists for signing for about two years.    Giving an appraisal of the agreement and the current  economic  and political situation on the continent, the Russian president  noted that: The global political confrontation came to an end  some years ago. But the consequences of the Cold War, according  to him, continued to poison the international atmosphere. We  have all begun to experience the growing threat of confrontation  of a different kind. The system of closed trading within the  framework of the former USSR and the CEMA quickly collapsed in  the new conditions. The liberalization of economic life in  Russia prompted our manufacturers to seek new markets in Europe.  This, in Yeltsin's view, was creating an unpredictable  situation in the trade in goods and services, in investment  activities and so on. With the signing of the agreement, this  threat is by-passing Europe, the Russian president emphasized,  drawing particular attention to the fact that the European Union  had rejected discriminatory approaches in economic ties with  Russia. For its part, Russia, Yeltsin declared, had made a  strategic choice in favor of integration into the world  community and, primarily, with the EU. Today Russia is  transforming itself into one of its most important partners.    In the opinion of the head of the Russian state, it is  precisely Europe that is being called upon to teach the world an  important lesson -- a lesson of real cooperation and a lesson of  true unification of efforts in the field of the economy,  ecology, and in settling conflicts. In this connection Yeltsin  drew the attention of the EU leaders to the fact that Russia has  a vital interest in stability in the West and in the center of  Europe. We are actively cooperating with European institutions  in attempts to settle the Yugoslav crisis, and the EU and all  the European countries, the Russian leader stated, can rely on  Russia in this sense.    Addressing the leaders of the EU countries, Yeltsin said  that  he is relying on their appropriate attitude, and that of all the  CSCE partners, as regards stability in the east of the  continent. Advocating a deepening of the processes of  integration and a broadening of the EU, the Russian leader  expressed the opinion that this would yield fruit if it does not  lead to the isolation of a lesser Europe in a greater Europe,  and if a similar approach is shown with regard to the processes  of integration within the framework of the Commonwealth of  Independent States.    In order to build a truly unified Europe and in order that  the 21st century should become the first century of peace for  our continent, Yeltsin stressed, the whole path of coordination  of interests must be travelled to its end. Every stop half-way,  he stressed, could mean that all previous efforts have been  wasted.    The signing of the agreement on partnership and cooperation  between Russia and the European Union has enabled Russia and the  EU to enter a qualitatively new stage of mutual relations. The  prospects for stage-by-stage economic integration have been  defined by joint efforts. The crux of it, according to the  Russian president, is an improvement in the conditions for the  access of Russian goods into the EU markets, a dynamic  advancement toward a free exchange of goods, capital and  services, and the creation of a national regime for setting up  companies and for their activities.    The signing of the agreement took place in St. George's  Church and, as the Russian leader pointed out, this is more than  just happy coincidence. May St. George the victorious, he said,  help us to vanquish the remnants of mistrust between one another  and to find a solution to common problems.</p>

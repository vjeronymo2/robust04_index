He was for a long time head of the Committee  for International Affairs at the previous Russian Parliament.    "I hope the U.S. President will take advantage of the visit  to familiarise himself even more deeply with Russian problems.  I think the U.S. should proceed from the assumption that it is  necessary to promote the development of Russian democracy, from  the understanding that any sort of encirclement is not for  Russia." In the opinion of Ambartsumov, the creation of another  sanitary cordon around Russia should be out of the question.    "We are now living through a difficult period of our  history.  However, Russia has seen even worse times, but inevitably was  brought back to life, like Phoenix from ashes. I hope the U.S.  Administration thinks the same way," he said.</p>

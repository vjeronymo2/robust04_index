			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Grigoriy Nesmyanovich: "Ukrainian Officers Union </F> Has Admitted There Will Be Spectacles in Addition to Exercises  in the Army"]    [Text] Kiev -- The Sixth Congress of the Ukrainian  Officers Union has been held here.    An appeal to the Ukrainian Supreme Council was prepared at  the congress calling for preservation of Ukraine's nuclear  status. A number of complaints at the congress were directed at  the Ukrainian president and especially at the defense minister.  Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy was reproached for the decline  of combat readiness and discipline, the increase in the number  of military crimes, and for the unprecedented increase in the  number of generals and "showcase" exercises, all of which had no  parallels in the Soviet period.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yegor Gaydar, leader of the Russia's Choice faction  in the State Duma, has expressed hope that the new Cabinet of  Ministers will not do things that will quickly wreck the economy.    Speaking at a democratic meeting in Moscow, Yegor Gaydar  said  that reformers in the government had seen Russia as a state that  could serve society. In his words, this approach envisaged  cutting down the state apparatus and minimizing officials' right  to divide and distribute; and reformers did achieve some degree  of success.    Yegor Gaydar noted that by the time he left the government,  the average salary in Russia had reached $100 a month, a large  trade surplus had been achieved, and large stocks of grain to  last until the next harvest had been amassed. Hence, dependence  on grain imports has decreased sharply, the free market is  beginning to work, and shortages have been fended off.    Yegor Gaydar said that if the situation becomes critical,  members of the present government might try to lay the blame for  it on the reformers.    He declined to comment on reports that Mikhail Gorbachev's  former consultants, Leonid Abalkin and Nikolay Petrakov, have  been drafted in to adjust the economic reform.</p>

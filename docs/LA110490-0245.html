			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHOLARS IN RESIDENCE;  </P> <P> SCHOOLS OFFER HOUSING FOR FACULTY; USC HOPES ITS PROJECT WILL AID NEIGHBORHOOD  </P> <P> USC film professor Michael Renov and his family were tired of renting but  couldn't afford to buy a house in many Los Angeles neighborhoods. And they had  neither the inclination to buy a fixer-upper nor the time to brave the commutes  from exurbias with more reasonably priced homes.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, USC was concerned that the high cost of Los Angeles-area real estate  made it difficult to keep and attract top-flight professors. In addition, the  school had embarked on an ambitious plan to improve the residential  neighborhood north of campus and to attract more teachers to live there.  </P> <P> So, a match was made. And another step was taken in the national trend for  universities, particularly in California, to help their faculty and staff  obtain affordable and attractive housing.  </P> <P> The Renovs soon will be among the first tenants in a 27-unit townhouse  condominium project that USC is building at Hoover and 30th streets, just two  blocks from school.  </P> <P> The neo-Craftsman-style development is for USC teachers and staff willing to be  pioneers both in a neighborhood that many faculty flee after classes and in a  new financial relationship with the school.  </P> <P> "We looked around and we really felt that for the price the faculty housing  ended up being, we would either be a great distance from campus or find  something very small or in need of repair," said Renov, who is chairman of the  critical studies department at the USC School of Cinema-Television.  </P> <P> He and his wife, Cathy Friedman, an official of a nonprofit organization that  aids female survivors of crime and domestic violence, bought the largest of the  USC floor plans: 1,950 square feet, with three bedrooms, three baths, family  room, study and a two-car underground garage with an internal staircase to  living quarters. The price: $285,000.  </P> <P> Prices (which start at $140,000 for a two-bedroom, two-bath unit) are kept  relatively low because USC, unlike commercial developers, is not seeking  profits. In addition, the university is keeping ownership of the land, leasing  it to the homeowner association.  </P> <P> For the Renovs, other attractions included the prospect of walking to school  (and thus making a small contribution to lessening auto emissions), proximity  to the child-care center near campus where their 3-year-old daughter is  enrolled (their second child is due in a few months) and increased  opportunities to take advantage of USC cultural and sporting events.  </P> <P> All that overcame jitters about crime, isolation and a lack of some  neighborhood amenities.  </P> <P> "We feel we are attaching ourselves in some ways to the university," said  Renov, who has been renting a house in the Carthay Circle area of Los Angeles.  "We are committing ourselves because we are fairly convinced that this is part  of a real long-term, broad-based effort to improve the environment of the USC  community."  </P> <P> That commitment from USC is real, according to Gerald M. Trimble, president of  the USC Real Estate Development Corp., the university-funded organization that  is building the $5.6-million project.  </P> <P> Fifteen of the 27 units are reserved, and Trimble is so confident of eventual  sellout that he is planning another 126 units (114 for sale, and 12 for rent)  on what is now a parking lot across 30th Street, in conjunction with  neighboring Hebrew Union College.  </P> <P> The projects are supposed to deliver what Trimble described as a "double  whammy": providing housing as a lure for scholars and creating a university  community outside USC's gates.  </P> <P> "We want people to move into this area and add purchasing power to the  neighborhood. It's important for the university and we are committed to doing  that," said Trimble, a former official in the redevelopment agency of downtown  San Diego.  </P> <P> The USC group also plans a large hotel and office complex on Figueroa Street  across from campus and has worked on restoration of Victorian homes in the  North University Park neighborhood, which is a National Register Historic  District. In the past, USC has been accused of being a land grabber, seeking to  impose its will on the mainly Latino and black residents in neighborhoods  surrounding the campus.  </P> <P> With the condos, the school clearly wanted to avoid such a perception. The  first 27 units are on land donated by the late marine biology professor Irene  McCulloch, after whom the project is named, and was the site of a small  apartment house occupied mainly by students, officials said. The next phase  requires no demolition.  </P> <P> On the flip side of any possible gentrification are professors wary of the  neighborhood because of crime, even though USC insists crime statistics in  North University Park are below the citywide average.  </P> <P> "We like the units and like the project," said one USC teacher who came close  to buying one of the townhouses but backed off. "While I don't mind renting and  living in the area, I'm not too thrilled about owning there because of the  gangs and graffiti. I don't think the value will appreciate enough."  </P> <P> To overcome such resistance, Trimble's firm paid particular attention to  attractive design and good security at the townhouses, which will be surrounded  by an ornamental wrought-iron fence and be patrolled by USC campus police. All  units have studies where an academic can retreat among his books and possibly  meet with students and colleagues.  </P> <P> All that, plus the collegiality of living in an academic community, attracted  USC neurology professor Richard Thompson and his wife, Judith, a USC  researcher, to buy one of the three-bedroom units on 30th Street.  </P> <P> They had lived in Stanford University's faculty housing before moving to USC  and a small condominium in Culver City three years ago. Now they are optimistic  about North University Park.  </P> <P> "Let's be blunt. Even at Stanford's campus housing there were robberies and  occasional rapes and assaults, and that's a wonderfully safe place," Richard  Thompson said. "In the long term, this is going to be a very nice neighborhood  as USC moves toward the city and the city moves toward USC."  </P> <P> As added bait, USC is putting no limits on resale prices and is not demanding a  share of profits. (Most schools, such as the UC branches, tie resale prices of  their university-built housing to various indexes and take a portion of  profits.) Some buyers can even get favorable mortgage deals from the university  credit union and grants for closing costs from the university.  </P> <P> However, like many other universities, USC has placed some restrictions on  resale to ensure the future buyers are on the staff.  </P> <P> USC is a relative latecomer to the faculty housing field in California. For  example, UCLA, Stanford and UC Irvine long have been involved in the field.  </P> <P> UCLA has the opposite problem of USC: The Westwood campus is surrounded by some  of the priciest real estate in the nation and little is available.  </P> <P> Through purchases or its own construction, UCLA has 144 apartments and 52  condos in Westwood for teachers to rent or buy at favorable rates. In addition,  in 1986 UCLA built 58 faculty townhouses north of campus in the Beverly Glen  area, which sold at the time for between $155,000 and $255,000.  </P> <P> The school is expected to break ground this autumn for 86 large single-family  faculty houses in the Bluffs area of Westchester. Those are expected to sell  for about $500,000, a price that is startling to most non-Angelenos but well  below what a commercial developer would charge, officials contend.  </P> <P> "Everybody has stories of faculty who come here from out of state and  everything looks fine until they start looking for housing. Then you get  various adjectives they use to describe their state of shock," said Harold W.  Horowitz, executive assistant to UCLA's chancellor.  </P> <P> UCLA has lost both potential hires as well as professors who were already on  the staff because of housing costs, he said.  </P> <P> UC schools also offer below-market-rate mortgages for both university-built and  private housing. Decisions on who should get those loans and homes can be  difficult, with department chairmen evaluating how important a particular  professor is to the school and how badly that faculty member needs housing  help.  </P> <P> UC Irvine has 388 faculty housing units on campus and 44 more are being  planned. The existing homes range from one-bedroom condominiums that sold for  about $100,000 to three bedroom detached houses that sold for $300,000, all  well below the prices in the Orange County market off-campus. And, faculty can  walk or ride bicycles to class, avoiding the freeway snarls.  </P> <P> "It's very clear this housing is part of the inducement to recruit faculty to  Orange County," said Leon Schwartz, UC Irvine's vice chancellor for  administrative and business services.  </P> <P> At USC, a majority of teachers live in Pasadena, Culver City and the South Bay  cities but only about 20 in neighborhoods adjacent to campus, according to  Trimble.  </P> <P> The university could have reinforced that pattern by building condominiums in  suburban communities and developing a shuttle van system to school, but that  would have done nothing for the campus neighborhood, not to mention the freeway  traffic situation and parking crunch, he stressed.  </P> <P> Over the next eight years, Trimble wants to build as many as 300 faculty  housing units in the USC area. "If it's going to work anywhere," he declared,  "it's going to work two blocks from campus."  </P></p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian alumina export project planned NATIONAL ALUMINIUM Company (Nalco), India's largest producer of aluminium, is to set up an export-oriented alumina (aluminium oxide) project for which it has entered into a collaboration with Hydro Aluminium of Norway. The feasibility report of the proposed 900,000 tonne capacity alumina refinery will be ready by March 1993, according to Mr SN Johri chairman of Nalco. The company would promote a joint venture to put up the refinery, which would require an investment of at least Dollars 800m. According to Mr Johri, an energy deficit country like India having the world's fifth largest reserves of bauxite (aluminium ore) should be concentrating on the export of alumina instead of aluminium. Many in the industry and the government believe that in the long term India should export alumina and import the metal. India has an estimated bauxite reserve of 2,900m tonnes. Indian Aluminium and Larsen &amp; Toubro are also planning to set up export-oriented alumina projects. The natural location for the Nalco unit is the Koraput district of Orissa, as the refinery will obtain bauxite from the existing mines of Nalco. The implementation of the project will take about four years. Nalco has been exporting alumina since 1988. In the year to March 1992, its export of alumina amounted to 379,600 tonnes, while the export target for the current year is 420,000 tonnes. Mr Johri is confident that in spite of the continuing world recession, Nalco should be able to export over 80,000 tonnes of aluminium in the current year, compared with 61,000 tonnes in 1991-92. The company has already been able to book export orders for more than 60,000 tonnes at an average price of Dollars 1,370 a tonne. Hindalco is to export another 20,000 tonnes. India has become an aggressive seller in the world market as the expected production of 520,000 tonnes of aluminium in 1992-93 will be at least 75,000 tonnes more than the domestic requirement. The problem has been compounded by the fact that the present year opened with stocks of 50,000 tonnes. There will be a marked rise in Nalco's exports next year when it starts international marketing of wire rod. Nalco is the only Indian producer whose aluminium has won London Metal Exchange recognition. Mr Johri thinks that domestic demand for aluminium should improve next year as the electricity companies start creating new capacities. In India, the electrical sector accounts for more than 40 per cent of aluminium consumption. It is thought that by the turn of the century, India will have a shortage of more than 400,000 tonnes of aluminium. Against this background, Nalco is seeking government approval for a Rs30bn (Pounds 530m) expansion programme. According to the detailed project report, bauxite mining capacity will be doubled to 4.8m tonnes with alumina refining capacity rising to 1.35m tonnes from 800,000 tonnes and aluminium smelting capacity to 345,000 tonnes from 218,000 tonnes. Power generation is forecast to rise to 960 Mw from 720 Mw. In addition, a 36,000 tonne capacity semi-fabrication unit will be built.</p>

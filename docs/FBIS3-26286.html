On behalf of the provincial  party committee, people's congress standing committee,  government, and Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference committee, and the people throughout the province,  Cheng Weigao, secretary of the provincial party committee,  extended cordial festive greetings to all the commanders and  soldiers of the army units stationed in our province and the  people's armed police force who had made great contributions to  maintaining social stability, developing the economy, and  consolidating national defense.    After introducing Hebei's economic and political situation,  Cheng Weigao said: In the past year, the province saw  continuously deepened reform, expanded opening up, developed  economy, political stability and unity, and social development  and progress. This was a result of the concerted efforts of the  people across the province, but it could not be separated from  the active participation and great support of the vast number of  officers and men stationed in the province.    Cheng Weigao pointed out: The endeavor of seizing the  opportunity to deepen reform, open wider to the outside world,  promote development, and maintain stability, requires the strong  unity and cooperation between the army and the government and  between the army and the people as well as the continued warm  concern and great support of the people's army. From the  perspective of defending social and political stability and  promoting comprehensive social progress, party committee and  governments at all levels and the people across the province  should put the efforts to support army building and maintain  close army- government and army-civilian relations in an  important position to meet the general demand of sharing the  common fate and linking the hearts of the people to each other.  They should defend our great wall of steel and enhance the  army's prestige as they cherish their eyes and achieve still  better results in the double-support work in the new situation.

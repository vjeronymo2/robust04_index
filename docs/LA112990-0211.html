Hospital officials hope they can cut this figure by one-fourth and recycle 9  tons a week.  </P> <P> Employees are being asked to toss copy and computer paper and cardboard into  recycling containers near computers, and plastic foam products, glass and  aluminum into separate barrels placed in cafeterias. The hospital by law must  continue to haul all infectious waste to landfills.  </P></p>

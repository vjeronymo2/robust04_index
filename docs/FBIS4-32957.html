			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish  at 0100 GMT on 31 May carries its "Straight Talk" Program with  Host Osvaldo Rodriguez, from BOHEMIA magazine, and his guest  reporter Renato Recio, from TRABAJADORES newspaper. They are  discussing the increased prices at workers' cafeterias, which  will go into effect on 1 June.    Rodriguez and Recio begin by talking about the excess  currency on the streets. Rodriguez points out that at the end of  March, there was 11.636 billion pesos of excess currency  circulating on the streets. Recio notes that the meals offered  at the cafeterias are very inexpensive.    Rodriguez and Recio change the focus of their discussion to  the lack of control at work centers. Recio points out: "We all  know that in Cuba, there is a lack of control over resources in  many -- too many -- economic enterprises. It would not be  absurd, it would be logical that among those who work in the  warehouses, or who handle and work with the foods that are later  offered at the cafeterias, there could be symptoms of lack of  control. Of course, whatever is misappropriated can graciously  be tacked onto the prices, and that is not right.    ``Therefore, I believe there should be strict control over  all resources sent to workers' cafeterias and that efforts  should be made to reduce costs. Earlier, you mentioned  self-sufficiency. That is something that could help improve  variety at the cafeterias without significantly increasing  prices. Therefore, the work centers should link what they offer  in their cafeterias with what is produced in the  self-sufficiency gardens.''    Rodriguez mentions that there are some workers who expect to  be paid to work on the self-sufficiency farms. Regarding this,  Rodriguez says: "That comrade who goes to work on the  self-sufficiency gardens has a salary, and his salary is often  higher than that of a farmer." He later says: "In Camaguey, they  are experimenting with methods whereby an industrial center can  create a cooperative with industrial workers to supply the  center's cafeteria with food."    Recio goes on to say: "I believe all roads should lead  toward  efficiency. If a road does not lead toward efficiency, I believe  it should be closed. That is how I see things." He notes that  the workers parliaments demonstrated that Cuba must eliminate  subsidies to work centers and to workers' cafeterias. He says:  "I believe we all agree -- or most of us agree -- that the  prices of the food served in the cafeterias should be increased,  but I insist that the labor unions make sure administrations do  not take shortcuts. The easiest thing is to solve economic  problems with prices." He goes on to say: "There are many  reasons for inefficiency at the workers' cafeterias. That  inefficiency is not what I should receive. I should receive  quality and above all, variety."    Recio concludes by saying: "I believe we all agree on price  increases and decreasing or eliminating subsidies to workers'  cafeterias, but this must be related to a cost analysis, a  practice that leans toward efficiency and a practice that leans  toward quality. It is sad to see prices increase while quality  decreases. Quality and price should be linked.    Rodriguez concludes by saying: "I do not believe workers'  cafeterias are always prepared to analyze this issue of cost.  That is why I foresee many injustices being committed when this  measure goes into effect on 1 June. I believe injustices will be  committed in some places. We, therefore, alert our listeners,  workers in general, labor union leaders, party leaders, and of  course, the administrations, to be watchful so these types of  injustices are not committed."</p>

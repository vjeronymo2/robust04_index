			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Thailand (1): New incentives for investors - Thailand's fragile coalition government has embarked on a policy of decentralisation which should ease congestion in Bangkok while providing more jobs to the poorer, outlying provinces After just a year in power the Thai government has felt obliged to publish a 48-page brochure about its achievements - a sign more of insecurity than of overweening pride in its accomplishments. Mr Chuan Leekpai, the Democrat Party prime minister who was elected last year following the army's slaughter of pro-democracy demonstrators and the collapse of a government sympathetic to the military, has restored a measure of political stability to Thailand over the past 15 months. The mild-mannered Mr Chuan has held together a fragile five-party coalition  -one of the original partners has been swapped for a smaller but more amenable party - but has been criticised for indecisiveness and a failure to tackle with sufficient vigour the various problems facing the country and its fast-growing economy. Mr Chamlong Srimuang, the devout Buddhist who was one of the leaders of last year's pro-democracy uprising, complains that the government has not done enough to help poor farmers, combat crime or put an end to the traffic congestion that plagues the capital Bangkok. 'Right now the government still doesn't have any clear-cut solution for those issues,' says Mr Chamlong. It is a measure of Mr Chuan's political difficulties that Mr Chamlong's own Palang Dharma (Moral Force) party is not  -as one might infer from his critical comments - in the parliamentary opposition, but rather one of the parties in the ruling coalition. Yet, given a political climate in which most of the headlines have been made not by discredited opposition parliamentarians but by in-fighting between coalition partners seeking to enhance the influence of their ministerial fiefdoms, it is perhaps remarkable that Mr Chuan has achieved anything at all. The mere survival of the government for more than a year is regarded as noteworthy. 'In Thai politics this is considered an achievement for a democratically-elected government,' comments Mr Sukhumbhand Paribatra, one of Thailand's leading political scientists. According to Mr Supachai Panitchpakdi, deputy prime minister, no elected government in Thailand has survived its full four-year term. 'Somebody will have to break this jinx,' he says. Government officials such as Mr Supachai insist that they have achieved much more than the disenchanted public gives them credit for; hence the need for the brochure. As promised in the election campaign, the government has embarked on a policy of decentralisation which should ease congestion in Bangkok and the eastern seaboard at the same time as bringing more jobs to the poorer, outlying provinces. To do this, the authorities have increased incentives for investors who build factories in remote areas, and promoted cross-border economic co-operation schemes that should benefit frontier towns such as Chiang Rai in the north and Hat Yai in the south, although plans to decentralise politics by having more local officials elected rather than appointed have made only slow progress. Mr Chuan has campaigned against child prostitution, tried to keep the armed forces out of business and politics, and refused to be provoked into hasty action by an outbreak of sabotage and shootings in the south (in which Moslem separatists appear to have been exploited by disaffected right-wing politicians and security force officers). The Thai economy has thrived for years under dictatorial as well as democratic governments, but Mr Chuan's coalition can justifiably claim to have fostered continued economic growth without some of the rampant examples of corruption which marred the records of previous regimes. Real gross domestic product is expected to rise about 7.5 per cent this year and eight per cent in 1994. Financial discipline has been maintained - year-end inflation is expected to be about 3.6 per cent - and the authorities have succeeded in curbing the worst excesses of stock market manipulators and speculators. The threat of US trade sanctions against Thailand has been diminished by a crackdown on music, video and software piracy. Government spokesmen admit that they have yet to solve some of problems closest to the hearts of the middle-class voters who helped bring them to power, including Bangkok's traffic jams and the daily damage to the environment wrought by uncontrolled industrialisation and tourism. A water shortage, blamed by environmentalists on the deforestation of watersheds, is likely to affect both rice farmers and city-dwellers in the months ahead and will prove a stern test of the government's popularity. The government has at least made a tentative start to reforming the educational system after decades of neglect by previous administrations. Schooling will be compulsory for nine years instead of the current six, and the state is to co-operate with the private sector on vocational training. Businessmen and academics agree that a complete overhaul of Thai schools and universities, which teach by rote and discourage initiative in the workplace, is vital if the Thai economy is to continue competing effectively with its equally dynamic Asian neighbours. With wages rising and mechanisation on the increase, Thailand is already losing its cheap labour advantage to countries such as China and Vietnam, and therefore needs to enhance the technical skills of its workforce. 'In the near-term, we cannot hope to match Korea or Japan in terms of raising our workers' standards or our technical standards,' says Mr Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, the finance minister. 'But we certainly hope more than to keep up with southern China, Indonesia and elsewhere.' Thailand's manufactured exports are still rising sharply, but Thai industry is poised at a point where it can rely neither on cheap labour nor on high technology but only on a balance between the two. 'We have to be piggy in the middle,' says Mr Richard Han, chief executive of Hana Microelectronics in Bangkok. 'The type of work we seem to be winning is the type which requires a fair amount of manufacturing discipline and process but still requires a fair amount of labour.' With so many unsolved problems on the agenda - including inadequate schooling, Bangkok's transport crisis, bureaucracy and corruption in the civil service, environmental degradation, and rural poverty - it is hardly surprising that siren calls for a return to 'strong' government are starting to be heard in Thailand. Such views reflect an emerging Asian orthodoxy, under the patronage of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's elder statesman, which suggests that enlightened authoritarian rule is better for decision-making and political stability in Asian countries than western-style liberal democracy. 'I think democracy has problems everywhere,' says Mr Anand Panyarachun, Thailand's own enlightened authoritarian, who was praised for his work as prime minister after being appointed by the military following a 1991 coup d'etat. He has recently hinted that he would not mind doing the job again. Others point to the particular weakness of Thai political parties: they lack ideological underpinnings, tend to be tied to a particular military leader or politician, and come and go with bewildering speed. If Mr Chuan, grappling with his fragile coalition on the one hand and the ambitions of the opposition and the armed forces on the other, succeeds both in surviving his full term and in carrying out even half of what he intends, that will be an achievement indeed.</p>

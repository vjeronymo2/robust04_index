			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / International Company News: VME plunges to Dollars 94m net loss VME, one of the world's largest producers of construction equipment, plunged to a net loss of Dollars 94m last year due to a recession described by Mr Tuve Johannesson, president and chief executive, as 'unprecedented in modern times'. The loss at the Brussels-based company compares with a deficit of Dollars 45m in 1991, but includes one-time costs of Dollars 19m related mainly to restructuring in North America. Sales slipped slightly to Dollars 1.36bn from Dollars 1.39bn VME's two parent companies, Volvo of Sweden and Clark Equipment of the US, pumped in a total of Dollars 100m last year to support the company. But Mr Johannesson, in an interview, said VME's balance sheet was strong. The group had also recently arranged a club deal with a group of German, Belgian and Swedish banks that, over time, would be very advantageous for the company. 'Fundamentally, we are in good shape, and I am optimistic in a reserved way,' Mr Johannesson said. This year's result would be considerably better than 1992's, even though VME is budgeting for a further 8 to 10 per cent fall in volumes. Mr Johannesson said that heavy rationalisation over the past three years, together with big improvements in productivity and manufacturing processes, would help VME achieve the improved result. Employment at the group, which was formed in 1985, has fallen from 10,400 in 1990 to 6,600. By the end of this year, with the closure of the St Thomas plant in Ontario this summer, it will reach 6,000. Apart from a general reduction in volumes on leading markets, price competition and restructuring costs, VME's performance last year was also affected by currency factors. The company produces 65 per cent of its equipment in Sweden, and the krone was 'strongly overvalued' until the devaluation in November, said the VME chief.</p>

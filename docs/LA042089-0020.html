			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELECTRIC CARS  </P> <P> When I was a little kid in Chicago, my friend Frank lived with his mother  around the corner in a house with a garage, which housed a black electric  sedan. It ran almost noiselessly, seated three, had a top speed of about 30,  and a range of (let's say) 50 miles. In other words, it was absolutely perfect  for city driving. When Frank's mother came home from shopping, visiting, or  whatever, she recharged this marvelous contraption by plugging it into a garage  socket.  </P> <P> What's the catch, if any?  </P> <P> LEON WOLFF  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Tory MP who likes to hog the headlines It was not until 4.45pm that the backbencher who hogged the bank holiday headlines graced us with his presence yesterday in Westminster's corridors. Mr David Evans, the irrepressible Tory MP for Welwyn Hatfield, stayed just long enough to say that he did not regret calling for the heads of the Conservative party chairman and nearly one-third of the cabinet on Monday in an extraordinary radio outburst. He then strode into the Commons chamber where MPs - including Mr John Patten, one of the six cabinet ministers Mr Evans wants to see replaced - were debating education. About 90 minutes earlier, he succeeded, in absentia, in playing a starring role in prime minister's questions when Mr John Smith, Labour leader, used Mr Evans' comments as a stick with which to beat Mr John Major. It is all too easy to write Mr Evans off as a parliamentary clown. Since entering the Commons in 1987, he has made his mark as a colourful loudmouth; the sort of MP who sends newspaper sketch-writers scurrying for their notebooks to capture a memorable barb fired at Labour ('the lot opposite') or a robustly-phrased insult hurled at Mr Smith ('the wriggler from Monklands East'). But there is a serious side to Mr Evans, a rightwinger now elevated to the powerful executive of the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers, that Tory high command ignores at its peril - particularly with elections looming and question marks hovering over Mr Major's leadership. This is his aptitude for saying memorably in public what many of his colleagues are whispering in private. Though his more cautious colleagues were yesterday deploring Mr Evans' decision to regale the airwaves with remarks they considered best confined to the Commons smoking room, many admitted that his views were shared by a sizeable minority of Tory MPs. An indication of his pulling power came two months ago when he attracted scores of Tory MPs to a late-night debate on the back-to-basics policy. It was vintage Evans - full of references to colleagues turning into 'spineless jellies' and socialist intellectuals 'with breeze-blocks for brains' - and they lapped it up.</p>

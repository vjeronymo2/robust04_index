			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Rental side behind advance to Pounds 3.22m at Warner Howard STRENGTH in rentals helped Warner Howard, the hot air hand dryer and laundry equipment company, improve interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.01m to Pounds 3.22m in spite of a fall in turnover from Pounds 11.2m to Pounds 10.7m for the half year to August 31. The board declared an interim dividend of 2.27p (2.12p) out of earnings per share of 9.11p (8.59p). 'In our rental business, which contributes about 85 per cent, volume held up. We have had a higher incidence of cancellations than we previously had. In the main it is straightforward company failures,' said Mr Harvey Adams, the finance director. The company said it had held prices although contracts renewed on existing equipment would normally be at reduced rates. Warner has more than 35 per cent of the market for rented hand dryers but dominates the market for rented commercial laundry equipment with roughly a 75 per cent share and has a small commercial catering equipment rentals business. Mr Adams said rentals were generally more popular in recession: 'We are not a recovery stock because our revenue flow tends to be quite stable.' Warner diversified its business in June with the acquisition of Gerrard Gamble Group, the commercial kitchen equipment suppliers. 'Not only has this given us an immediate source of rental income which is welcome, but it has also taken the company into the relatively untapped market of renting commercial kitchen equipment,' said Mr Ronald Hooker, the chair-man. Warner does not disclose balance sheet figures at the halfway stage but said it had no gearing and cash flow was positive. It would consider any further acquisition opportunities.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 9 (AFP)--China rejected Thursday  South Korea's last-ditch efforts to persuade it to support  economic sanctions against North Korea, urging the parties  concerned to return to talks to avert a confrontation.    Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen told his visiting  counterpart Han Sung-chu during a working breakfast that "we are  not in favour of UN Security Council involvement in this issue."    "We do not agree on sanctions, for sanctions would only  serve  to push the parties concerned into confrontation with one  another and result in a situation that no one would like to  see," Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang quoted Qian as  saying.    Asked if Beijing believed Pyongyang would actually follow  through with its threats of war if faced with sanctions, Shen  simply said, "it is hard to predict how the DPRK would react to  sanctions, but at the very least sanctions are not a good  choice."    Qian's remarks came shortly before the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) governors were due to meet in Vienna to  discuss the recent escalation in the Korean crisis, sparked by  fears that Pyongyang was diverting plutonium from its Yongbon  reactor to make nuclear weapons.    Han arrived here Wednesday from the United States for a  lightning stopover in a bid to persuade China, a permanent  member of the UN Security Council and Stalinist North Korea's  only major ally, to endorse economic sanctions against  Pyongyang. He left for Seoul later Thursday.    Shen quoted Qian as telling Han that "although there are  some  difficulties now, the parties concerned should still remain calm  and concentrate on exercising restraint instead of closing the  door to negotiations."    In the past, negotiations had achieved some progress, he  said, but added that more recently the parties concerned --  namely the United States, the two Koreas and the IAEA -- "failed  to reach consensus concerning technical issues leading to a  dramatic change in the situation."    He was referring to North Korea's failure to allow IAEA  inspectors to monitor properly the discharging of fuel rods from  the five-megawatt Yongbyon reactor.    The inspectors said in a recent report they could no longer  guarantee that plutonium had not been diverted during the  operation.    Asked to elaborate on South Korean reports that Qian pledged  to Han that China would make its "best efforts" to resolve the  crisis, Shen said the foreign minister was referring to  Beijing's willingness to play "a bigger role" to try to bring  the parties back to the negotiating table.    A U.S. State Department spokesman said Wednesday it was now  too late for Washington, which is pushing for sanctions, to  resume direct talks with Pyongyang.    Shen warned that if any parties sought to resolve the crisis  outside the framework of negotiations, "it will possibly lead to  a downturn in the situation and lead the situation to a critical  point."    "It is only through such negotiations that the situation can  be accorded a settlement," he said.</p>

This attack was also aimed at jeopardizing the  democratic process; at hampering the holding of the legislative  elections; and at paralyzing economic activities whose effective  resumption has started to cause some concern to the enemies of  the Togolese people.    The government is happy at the failure of the attempt to  assassinate the head of state, and expresses to him its deep  gratitude for his invaluable contribution for the restoration of  peace and security in the country. As of now, the security  forces, through their courageous and efficient action, have put  to flight the attackers and restored order and security in the  country. The government warmly congratulates the Togolese Armed  Forces, the National Gendarmery, the national police, and  keepers of the territorial security for their courage and their  loyalty. It also congratulates the Togolese people in general  and those of Lome and its environs in particular for their calm,  discipline, and contribution to the restoration of peace.    Following these painful events which plunged the Togolese  people into mourning, the government expresses its compassion to  the bereaved families and wishes a quick recovery to those  wounded. Order and security have been restored, and the  government is calling on the people of Lome and its environs to  go about their normal business beginning today, Saturday, 8  January.    However, in order to consolidate peace and tranquility, the  curfew will remain in force from 2100 to 0500 in Lome and its  environs, beginning today, Saturday, 8 January. Finally, the  government has decided to reopen the northern and eastern land  borders. Western land borders remains closed until further  notice.    Issued: Lome, 8 January.

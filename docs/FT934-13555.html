			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / People: Sir Simon retires; Hardie takes over The former gardening correspondent of Tatler magazine has retired. Better known for the past 12 years as chairman of WH Smith, Sir Simon Hornby said yesterday that he would be retiring from the helm of one of the UK's best-known high street names, making way for Jeremy Hardie, deputy chairman since September 1992. Hornby's retirement at the age of 59 with effect from January 30 1994 will coincide with other executive level changes at Smith's. Sir Malcolm Field will become group chief executive; David Roberts will become managing director responsible for distribution and group support services; and Peter Troughton is to become managing director, UK retailing. He will be succeeded as managing director, WH Smith retail, by Peter Bamford, currently president and chief executive officer of Wee Three Record Shops, a US-based subsidiary. Hardie, 55, has been a director of John Swire and Sons since 1982. His business career includes stints as chairman of the National Provident Institution and of Alexanders Discount. He is a director of National Mortgage Bank, William Cook and Murray Lawrence Holdings. He first joined the board of WH Smith in 1988. His background is solidly rooted in the academic life; following a B Phil in Economics at Nuffield College, Oxford, he held a variety of academic posts, was fellow and tutor in Economics at Keble College, Oxford, and has written a number of books on economics. Hardie was a member of the Mergers and Monopolies Commission between 1976-83, and the commission's deputy chairman during his last three years there. He then took a stab at a political career, contesting Norwich South for the SDP in 1983, and again for the SDP/Alliance in 1987, though without success. Hornby's links with WH Smith go back to 1958, when he first joined the company. Despite giving up writing on gardening for the Tatler in 1987 - his column lasted four years - he maintains strong interests in horticultural affairs and is on the council of the Royal Horticultural Society. Although retiring from Smith's, he is not relinquishing his interests in the business world; he remains, for example, a non-executive director of Pearson, owner of the Financial Times.</p>

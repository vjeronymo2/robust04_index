			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / UK Company News: SE still favoured channel for announcements MOST LISTED companies plan to continue releasing formal announcements exclusively through the London Stock Exchange, despite being given the freedom from today to make announcements to the stock market through other channels. This is the preliminary finding from a Stock Exchange survey of companies' intentions, timed to coincide with the relaxation in publication rules. News that few companies intend to use the new freedom to issue announcements through channels other than the exchange will come as a disappointment to Mr John Redwood, corporate affairs minister, who forced the exchange to give up its monopoly on price-sensitive company announcements this autumn. Companies must still lodge a copy of any announcement with the exchange, but from today can also give it simultaneously to any other news vendors. This will give rivals to Topic, the exchange's commercial information system, greater opportunity to compete to publish news first. However, many listed companies, while welcoming the increased competition, fear the effect of a free-for-all in company news on the market for their shares. The exchange has itself mounted a strong campaign in recent weeks to persuade companies not to use rival information services. In a letter to all listed companies last month, Ms Christine Dann, the exchange's chief operating officer, warned of 'a high likelihood of incomplete information reaching the market', prompting the exchange to declare 'a period of indicative trading' - when market-makers do not have to quote firm prices.</p>

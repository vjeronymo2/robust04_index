Li Zemin said: This year is critical for pushing forward  reform in a comprehensive way and accelerating economic  development. The overall requirement for the work is that we  should continue to carry out the guiding spirit of the 14th CPC  Congress, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee, and the ninth provincial CPC congress by further  emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts, seizing  opportunities, deepening reform, opening wider to the outside  world, accelerating economic development; pushing forward  economic restructuring, technological progress, and enterprise  management; and enhancing economic quality and efficiency  through reform, reorganization, and transformation so as to  maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the  national economy and to promote social and political stability.    Li Zemin said: It is an essential task to maintain the  sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national  economy. But we must adopt new approaches to develop our  economy because great changes have occurred in the economic  environment this year. It is absolutely not practical for us to  continue the same old ways of rashly launching new projects and  engaging in extensive enlargement and extensive management. We  should have a real change in our guiding ideology of economic  development. A new economic structure has created good  conditions for enterprises to compete on equal terms and to seek  self-development. It is necessary to seize favorable  opportunities by deepening reform and taking greater advantage  of the market mechanism, as well as of economic, legal, and  policy means to gradually lead the economy onto the right track  of optimizing the economic structure, enhancing economic quality  and performance, and becoming more export-oriented. In terms of  concrete guidance for the work, we should, first of all, work  harder on agricultural production. We should conscientiously  put it on the priority agenda. Party committees and governments  at all levels should strengthen their leadership and correct  their laissez-faire tendency so as to stabilize grain  production. The orientation of the reform adopted by the  central authorities last year should be maintained. It is  necessary to conscientiously carry it out in accordance with  various policies and measures adopted last year by the  provincial meeting on rural work. Meanwhile, further efforts  should be made to adjust and improve the reform in light of  current new conditions and problems. All in all, we should not  only maintain stable grain production but also continuously  increase peasants' income. Efforts should also be made to  ensure the supply of vegetables, pork, and other nonstaple  products in large and medium cities. We should adopt measures  to gradually establish means of macroeconomic regulation and  control over the production, circulation, and storage of grain,  edible oil, meat, and vegetables to stabilize the market with a  sufficient supply. Second, great efforts should be made to  restructure the economy and enhance economic efficiency. It is  imperative to seize vital opportunities to achieve new progress.  We should also meet the requirement of the market, focus on  improving economic quality and efficiency, and accelerate the  pace of readjustment. While striving to improve large and  medium enterprises, we should attach great importance to medium  and small enterprises, which are large in number and which  affect many economic sectors. Particular attention should be  paid to reorganizing and transforming enterprises which are  small in size, have insufficient funds, have large losses, and  are unable to function properly. More efforts should be made to  improve products, to enhance technical progress, to expand  markets, and to merge enterprises. We can achieve better  economic results through strengthening the reform, management,  reorganization, and transformation of enterprises. Third, it is  necessary to accelerate the growth of the export-oriented  economy. It is our unswerving principle to develop an  export-oriented economy. We must take steps and make greater  efforts to publicize our drive and in communicating with the  people. In this way, we can foster a favorable image and  maintain the positive momentum of increasing foreign funds,  foreign trade, and economic ties with foreign countries.  Fourth, we must continue to accelerate the construction of  basic facilities, further free our way of thinking, and continue  to thoroughly carry out the reform so as to gradually relieve  bottlenecks.    Li Zemin said: In carrying out reform, we should adhere to  the principle of integrating measures for achieving major  breakthroughs with supplementary measures. In light of  requirements for establishing a modern enterprise system, we  should make a breakthrough in reforming property rights,  accelerate the change of enterprises' operating mechanisms, and  deepen their overall reform. While focusing on experiments with  the modern corporate system, we should make more efforts to  reform medium and small enterprises, which are large in number  and which affect many economic sectors. Active efforts should be  made to explore rational forms and ways to merge and manage  medium and small enterprises. For small enterprises, we should  work harder to improve their structure by having them contracted  out or leased. We should transform and merge them. In some  cases, we should auction them off or let them go bankrupt. We  should clearly define their property rights and carry out an  inventory and examination of their stockpiles and capital.  Collective enterprises in urban and rural areas should actively  and properly practice, to a greater extent, the shareholding  corporate system. To keep in step with this effort, we should  also push forward the development of the factors-of-production  market and the reform of organizations making up the social  security system.    Li Zemin said: The greater difficulty we encounter in reform  and economic development requires that we exert greater efforts  to "grasp two links" because this is a task which has a great  bearing on the overall state of social stability. At present,  we should attach great importance to ideological and political  work and launch an extensive propaganda and educational drive.  Meanwhile, we should integrate ideological and political work  with efforts to solve the people's concrete problems. We should  conscientiously carry out the work of stabilizing commodity  prices, improving the "vegetable basket" project, subsidizing  the living expenses of workers and staff members, and helping  people solve their problems. It is imperative to analyze and  handle various contradictions among the people. We should give  priority to ideological and political work as well as to other  related work, and we should carry these out thoroughly. In  terms of the anticorruption struggle and the construction of  spiritual civilization, we should carry these out in accordance  with the plan adopted by the provincial party committee. We must  see to it that the expected results for the current stage are  achieved.    Li Zemin said: It is necessary to stress the importance of  investigation and study. Leading comrades at all levels should  have a clear understanding of the trend of economic and social  development. Their current important task is get rid of such  activities as wining and dining. They should go to grass-roots  units and the production front line to learn the real situation  so as to gain the initiative in leading the work.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sakhr Abu-al-'Awn] </F>   [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, April 3 (AFP) --  Israeli troops completed their evacuation of the largest  military base in Gaza City on Sunday [3 April] after emptying  its prison, Palestinian officials said.    Witnesses said an armoured vehicle and a truck were the last  equipment driven out of the "Seafront" army camp as Israel and  the PLO resumed talks in Cairo to try to launch autonomous rule  in Gaza and Jericho within 10 days.    A couple of soldiers however remained in a look-out post and  border police were on duty outside the base know as "Hof" in  Hebrew.    PLO officials, who refused to be named, said the last  prisoners in the jail at the camp had been moved to other  facilities. Until early March 200 men were held at the prison,  known to Palestinians as "Ansar II".    The army first began removing soldiers and materiel from the  Seafront base in November.    The army steadfastly refuses to confirm details of any  pullout, but the first Palestinian policemen are expected to be  deployed in the territories during the coming week.    Palestinian witnesses also said equipment including an  electronic gate had been dismantled at the army headquarters  nearby in the centre of Gaza City.    Activity at the sprawling HQ appeared to have been reduced  to  a minimum, they said, noting a drastic reduction in the usually  constant comings and goings.    Israeli forces are set to pull back to three core areas on  the Gaza Strip from where they will maintain security for the  4,000 Jewish settlers who are set to remain on the strip under  the September 13 autonomy agreement.    In the aftermath of the February 25 Hebron mosque massacre,  the PLO and Israel have pledged to speed up the implementation  of Palestinian self-rule.    Meanwhile Israeli police also started a pullout from Jericho  on Sunday, but under a hail of stones from Palestinian youths,  an AFP correspondent reported.    A police spokesman confirmed that equipment had been taken  out, but said the 18 Israeli policemen and five Palestinian  employees would remain in place in Jericho for the time being.    And as part of the Cairo security accord package under which  160 lightly-armed foreign observers are to be deployed in  Hebron, the Israeli military restored Mustafa al-Natshah as  mayor of Hebron on Sunday, more than 10 years after abolishing  his role.</p>

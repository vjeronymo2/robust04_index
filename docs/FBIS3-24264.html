			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Ye. Lobacheva, expert, under the rubric "Light </F> Industry": "Survival Strategy"]    [Text] The shortage of raw materials and the enormous debt  of customers to textile industry enterprises have brought this  sector of the economy to the verge of collapse.    In the opinion of experts, the existence of domestic light  industry depends largely on the strategy which the sectors'  leaders adopt: to focus the main efforts on getting state  subsidies or on raising the efficiency of their own production  by mobilizing internal resources.    But it is not easy to do this when we consider that on the  world market domestic output is not very competitive and demand  within the country has sharply declined. Moreover, the  indebtedness of textile industry enterprises' on bank credits  today totals 243.6 billion rubles [R], while customer  indebtedness to enterprises totals R245.8 billion, which  includes overdue debts of R101.4 billion. Textile workers, in  turn, owe their suppliers R146.4 billion.    In the best years Russia produced 5.8 billion square meters  of cotton fabric, 600 million square meters of flax [linen], 522  million of wool, and more than 1 billion of silk. It is  estimated that in 1993 2.2 billion square meters of cotton  fabric, 330 million square meters of flax, 220 million square  meters of wool, and 650 million square meters of silk were  produced. In our opinion, the situation will change very little  in 1994. The problem of marketing finished output and the higher  prices and shortage of raw material will be the main reasons for  the crisis in the sector. By the start of the fourth quarter,  deliveries of raw materials under intergovernmental agreements  were 60-percent fulfilled, while certain agreements were not  fulfilled at all, although purchase prices for raw materials are  approaching the world level: for wool--80 percent and for  cotton--80-100 percent of the price on the foreign market.    In 1993 the export of Russian textiles to the European  Community [EC] countries was virtually suspended, which was  explained formally by the expiration of the 1989 agreement on  textile trade between the USSR and the EC. In fact the reason  for it was the general economic decline in Western Europe, which  was reflected to a greater degree in the textile industry, and  that led to termination of textile exports to the EC from third  countries. The development of textile exports in 1994 will be  complicated by the fact that Russia is intending to sign a  treaty on partnership and cooperation with the EC where a  special clause stipulates that Russia will commit itself not to  exceed established quotas for supplying certain types of textile  goods. We have about 30 such categories: from cotton fabrics to  output with a higher degree of processing--raincoats and suits.  In general, export quotas today suit producers, but textile  capacities may grow and it will become necessary to increase our  own exports.    The tendency of domestic and world prices for output to  converge continues, although at the present time this sector  still has the largest gap between the levels of domestic and  world prices of any sector; on the average prices for Russian  output are 12-13 percent of the world prices.    The most complicated situation has taken shape in the cotton  subsector, which is completely dependent on imported raw  materials. Here the decline in production totals 33 percent of  the 1992 level. The allocation of R95 billion worth of targeted  credit to buy raw cotton, negotiations with Uzbekistan, and the  government's decree "On the Purchase of Imported Raw Cotton for  State Needs" have not changed the situation in the sector. One  of the ways to develop the sector proposed by the Ministry of  Economics is technical re-equipping in order to produce  competitive output and the involvement of defense enterprises  with their technical and intellectual potential within the  framework of the conversion program.    In October of the fourth quarter, production of cotton yarn  grew by 10.8 percent and of cotton fabrics--by 1.3 percent; and  it is estimated that at the end of the year, the level of  production had reached 82 percent of the 1992 level. In 1994  production volumes in the cotton cloth industry will depend on  deliveries and purchases of raw materials, but according to  specialists' estimates, no sharp drop in production is expected.  Because of the need to buy imported raw materials, prices are  expected to rise and approach world prices, while at this time  domestic prices are 10-30 percent of world prices. Because of  purchasing raw materials at future world prices, the rate at  which prices for final output approach world prices will  increase.    <FIG ID=FBIS-USR-029C-51A>           Dynamics of Production of Wool Yarn in Russia </FIG>       <FIG ID=FBIS-USR-029C-51B>             Dynamics of Prices for Wool Yarn </FIG>         In 1993 the decline in wool production totaled about 1  percent of the 1992 level. In October 1993, production of virgin  wool rose by 10.7 percent and of wool yarn--by 10.3 percent  (relative to the January 1993 level, production volumes almost  doubled). For wool fabrics, during the year one could trace an  absolutely clear pattern of seasonal consumption and shaping of  the production program based on specific consumer orders. From  January through April, production rose by 11.5 percent, from May  through August production dropped by 17 percent, and since  September production growth is again apparent. On the whole  production in 1993 remained at the 1992 level.    Domestic prices for wool, wool yarn, and fabrics on the  whole  underwent a general uptrend and the index in October was 118,  while in November prices rose by 10-20 percent. Domestic prices  are 75 percent of world prices for wool, 74 percent for wool  yarn, and 13 percent for wool fabrics. In 1994 a fairly stable  situation is anticipated in the wool sector's production, since  it provides most of the profits and a corresponding share of  revenue for the budget in the textile industry structure.    The present situation in the flax sector is complicated by  the fact that at the end of September 1993, only 42 percent of  the volume of flax of the 1992 harvest had been gathered,  despite the targeted credits to flax processing plants, hemp  mills, and seed growing stations through the overall credit for  the agroindustrial complex. Twenty percent of the needed raw  materials were bought as imports at enterprises' expense. On 25  August 1993, the government decree "On Development of the  Federal Target Program `Rebirth of Russian Flax'" was adopted.  In accordance with this program, production of flax-cotton yarn,  which has the most profitable and promising export potential, is  supposed to be developed. This program envisions terminating  import purchases, including imports purchased with state  resources. In practice this means accelerated growth in 1994 in  prices for linen fabrics (because of greater demand) and  production's dependence on world prices for raw materials (short  and long flax fiber) as well as our own flax harvest. World  prices for flax fiber are on the average 4 U.S. dollars,  yarn--up to 18 U.S. dollars, and fabrics--up to 8 U.S. dollars.  On the average Russia's domestic prices are 10-40 percent of  world prices depending on the raw materials used. In 1994 prices  will obviously rise on the average 3- to 3.5-fold, which will  make them substantially closer to world prices.    In 1993, according to the estimates of ITKOR [Institute of  Commodity Movement and Conditions of the Wholesale Market], the  level of production of silk fabrics was 88 percent. But 446.011  million linear meters were produced in the first 11 months of  1993 (94 percent of the expected volume). Prices for silk  fabrics rose an average of 10-fold, which is explained by both  the rise in raw material prices and the sharp rise in prices for  energy media.    Exports of virgin wool fabrics in 1993 totaled 60 percent of  the 1992 level; this is related to higher export tariffs as well  as the drop in production volumes.    Demand for virgin wool fabrics is largely determined by  their  high price, and no change in the structure of demand is foreseen  in 1994.</p>

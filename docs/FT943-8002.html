			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: BASF ahead 41.4% in first half BASF, the first of the big German chemical groups to report half-year results, yesterday posted pre-tax profits up 41.4 per cent to DM683m (Dollars 435m). Mr Max Kley, board director, said the company was in the middle of a turnround which had begun at the end of last year. Volumes were up 9 per cent year-on-year, but prices, on average, remained 2 per cent down on the same period last year. Sales in Germany fell 2.3 per cent as the country continued to struggle with recession. The results were at the lower end of analysts' expectations because of heavy restructuring charges in North America, and a decline in earnings from interest and currency transactions, which together amounted to DM1.44bn compared with DM745m last year. Group turnover was up 4.7 per cent at DM23.1bn. Post-tax profits more than doubled to DM425m, partly due to a rise in minority interests and a fall in the tax charge. Restructuring, initiated in 1990, was beginning to bear fruit, said Mr Kley. It had reduced fixed costs by more than DM1bn. The cost of personnel fell 4.8 per cent to DM4.68bn. Numbers employed should fall from 115,000 last year to 107,800 by the end of this year, he added. Reduced capital expenditure also helped, down 28.7 per cent to DM1.28bn from DM1.8bn. BASF was aiming for a rate of return on assets of at least 10 per cent. This would correspond to pre-tax profits of DM3.5bn from a balance sheet of DM40bn, a target which should be achieveable in 1996 or 1997. Mr Kley said BASF intended to make acquisitions in the pharmaceuticals industry. Its drugs division is only the 40th largest in the world. It intended to acquire operations in the UK, France and the US, primarily in prescription medicines, but also generic non-patented drugs, said Mr Kley. The results were particularly boosted by the chemicals division, whose sales rose 14.3 per cent to DM3.12bn. Plastics and fibres turnover increased 12 per cent to DM5.4bn. Dr Albrecht Eckell, board member, said selling prices for the majority of plastics were still at an unacceptably low level and improvements were urgently required. Polyethylene prices were particularly inadequate. High density polyethylene prices had actually fallen in some cases during the second quarter. But he hoped to achieve higher polypropylene prices later this year because raw material costs were rising. Lex Page 14</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: Degussa up 14% to DM49m on strong demand in first quarter RIGOROUS cost-cutting and heavy demand for dental work ahead of reforms to the German health system helped Degussa, the German metals, chemicals and drugs group, to increase profits by 14 per cent in its first quarter. Pre-tax earnings jumped to DM49m (Dollars 30m) in the three months to the end of December, compared with the 'weak' DM43m last time, the company said in a letter to shareholders yesterday. Group sales, up 9 per cent at DM3.3bn, were bolstered by a 37 per cent increase from the fast-growing pharmaceuticals division, which increased turnover from DM384m to DM527m. Even excluding sales from the newly-consolidated Arzneimittelwerk Dresden and the recently-purchased Sankin Industry, a leading Japanese dental supplier, turnover in this division rose 10 per cent. The domestic dental business profited from extra demand created by impending health service reforms which will oblige patients to pay more for treatment. However, the reforms will have a negative effect on sales and profits from the pharmaceuticals business, which has grown rapidly to account around a fifth of total group turnover. The core metals sector saw sales rise 9 per cent to DM1.66bn, including a 20 per cent increase to DM913m in turnover from precious metals, but 'as in the previous year, there was a substantial loss', the letter said. Precious metals, meanwhile, showed improved earnings. Sales from the chemicals division stagnated at DM1bn, although earnings improved. The management has split the group into three clear divisions, decentralised decision-making, and thinned down the bureaucracy. After adjustments for acquisitions, the payroll was cut by 2,000 in the last full financial year and a further 530 jobs went in the quarter under review. As a result, group labour costs rose just 3 per cent in the three months to January.</p>

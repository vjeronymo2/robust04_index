			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Overreaction to Breakdown of Japanese-U.S. </F> Talks Is Taboo"]    [Text] The Japanese-U.S. summit talks have ended in discord  on the issue of setting sectoral numerical targets because Japan  insisted on saying "no" to the request. The result leaves a  bitter taste in our mouths, and it is difficult to predict when  they can recover from the aftermath, even after a cooling-off  period.    In reviewing the actual economic trends from a calm  viewpoint, however, Japanese and U.S. industrial circles are not  exchanging heavy fire with each other. In other words, heated  disputes between the two governments do not actually reflect  competition or cooperation in the private sector as they are.    Thanks partly to the economic recovery, U.S. economic  circles  have toned down their "theory of the Japanese threat." Because  the electronics and auto industries have completely regained  their competitiveness, more people have come to feel that "Japan  is no longer worthy of our attention."    As an actual trend, many people expect that Japan's  current-accounts surplus will be reduced rapidly. The  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)  predicts that the ratio of the current surplus to the gross  national product (GNP) will drop to around less than 2.5 percent  next year from 3 percent in 1992.    It is certain that imports of cars from the United States  will sharply increase in the future. The auto industrial  circles think that even if an import target is set, actual U.S.  auto exports to Japan will exceed this target.    Therefore, we should not overreact to the breakdown of the  current talks because there are many factors that will duly  settle various issues even if no measures are taken.    Moreover, while the United States actually has achieved  substantial, 3-percent growth, Japan has achieved zero growth.  It is impossible to discuss matters at the same table without  taking this gap in growth rates into consideration. Japan's  economic recovery is the best remedy to reduce the surplus and  also the best way to contribute to the global economy.    If the United States should impose sanctions on Japan  because  of the latter's rejection of numerical targets, the sanctions  will not only worsen the economic situation in Japan but also  exert an adverse influence on the United States and the  international community. U.S. President Bill Clinton is  dissatisfied with Japan's economic stimulus package. However,  the economic measures are not the final ones. Other measures  such as the income tax cut scheduled for next year will be  announced.    The current issue is the possible increase in mutual  distrust, which can be attributed to the fact that the  controversy over the introduction of the yardstick known as  numerical targets has become sort of a religious fervor.    Japan, once stung by pressure to permit the United States to  gain a "20-percent" share of its semiconductor market, has  insisted on rejecting numerical targets, because these induce  excessive government intervention, impede the principle of  competition between markets, and run counter to the course of  the deregulation policy of the Hosokawa administration.  Industrial circles have also become allergic to numerical  targets. Under these circumstances, the government cannot force  industrial circles to accept numerical targets by issuing  administrative guidance, nor does it have such power. In this  connection, industrial circles are rapidly veering away from the  government and are moving toward deregulation.    The United States' argument that "a yardstick is needed to  measure progress" is understandable. However, this depends on  whether one should gauge "results," such as a "20-percent"  market share, or "processes," such as cost reductions and  improved services.    It is impossible for the government to conclude an  intergovernmental accord that employs "results" as a yardstick  because this will lead to managed trade. It may be rather  difficult to get used to employing the second factor,  "processes," as a yardstick in the intergovernmental accord, but  a compromise can possibly be reached if discussions are focused  on this point.    At the actual talks, however, the collapse of the  negotiations was destined from the outset because the United  States demanded "results" or similar criteria as a yardstick.    The two countries should seek ways to achieve coexistence  and  coprosperity after a cooling-off period. The future of the U.S.  economy depends on how deep are the inroads it can make into  Asia -- and to do this, Japan's cooperation is indispensable.    What Japan needs to do is to work out a long-term strategy  based on changes in its economic structure. For example, it  should seek an equal distribution of work with the United States.</p>

			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Business and the Law: Justice seeks its price - Robert Rice on the arguments over curbing legal aid in the UK The government's response to the soaring legal aid bill of the 1980s was to cut back on the numbers eligible for financial assistance, curb lawyers' pay, impose standard fees for criminal cases and introduce legal aid franchising. The medicine was hard for lawyers to take, but appears to have worked. Legal aid expenditure is no longer rising at a rate of almost 30 per cent a year. The increases in the past two years have been below 10 per cent. Future rates of increase will be even lower. The eligibility cuts were particularly successful. The government reduced financial eligibility for legal aid in April 1993 so that people with incomes above the level of income support would no longer qualify for free legal advice and would have to pay a much larger contribution towards the cost of legal aid. The government estimated the cuts would save Pounds 43m in 1993-94, Pounds 110m in 1994-95 and Pounds 173m in 1995-96. Having made the cuts it expected total expenditure to reach Pounds 1.54bn in 1995-96. In fact, legal aid expenditure in 1993-94 was some Pounds 73m less than provided for in the supply estimates. Expenditure in the current year is also expected to be underspent by at least Pounds 70m. As a result, the government has reduced the provision for the next two years by more than Pounds 70m in each year. Expenditure is now expected to rise to Pounds 1.6bn in 1997-98, just 4 per cent more than the original estimate for 1995-96. Given the apparent success in holding back legal aid expenditure, the Law Society, the solicitors' governing body, has argued the government could now afford to relax its grip slightly. But rather than restoring the eligibility cuts  - something Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, promised he would do as soon as it became feasible  - the government seems intent on further tight-ening control of the legal aid bill. Next spring Lord Mackay will publish a green paper outlining plans to make legal aid a cash-limited scheme controlled by 'fundholders for justice' along similar lines to the GP fundholders system. The idea was first mooted in July in a paper by the Social Market Foundation, a right-wing think tank. The paper was written by three members of the advisory group assisting the Treasury fundamental review of the expenditure of the Lord Chancellor's department, part of the purpose of which was to examine access to publicly funded legal services and the options for ensuring funding is provided in as cost-effective a way as possible. The paper proposed establishing a system of fundholders who would control the funding of legal aid in a particular area. At present, those needing legal aid first approach a solicitor who applies for legal aid on their behalf, either to the court, for criminal legal aid, or to the Legal Aid Board, for civil legal aid. They then assess whether the case merits legal aid. Those who qualify are offered legal aid so long as they also meet the financial eligibility requirements and pay any contribution which may be ordered. Under the proposed fundholder scheme, the fundholder would be the first point of contact. Fundholders would determine what services people required and seek the most cost-effective means of providing them. They would have a limited budget at their disposal. The idea was well received by the government. The Law Society is up in arms, however. It says the Social Market Foundation's analysis of expenditure trends is out of date; its economic analysis of the way legal aid operates ignores fundamental features of the legal aid system; and the fundholder scheme would turn legal aid into a lottery. Mr Charles Elly, Law Society president, says: 'Cash-limiting would mean that whether you got legal aid depended on where you lived and when you applied, rather than on the needs of your case. What is worse, it could mean legal aid would be cut off from cases involving a challenge to the government.' The society acknowledges legal aid expenditure rose very rapidly in the 1980s, doubling in real terms since 1987-88, while total government expenditure increased by only 14 per cent. But it says many of the factors behind the increase reflect deliberate government policy. Among these were: The creation of a statutory duty solicitor scheme to provide advice at police stations. That cost Pounds 66m in 1993-94. A rise in the number of expensive serious fraud trials. The estimated cost to the legal aid fund of the failed prosecution of Mr George Walker, former head of Brent Walker, is Pounds 5m. Increased public awareness of available legal remedies. More generous legal aid for children. The success of the green form scheme under which people receive free initial advice on a legal problem. At the same time, the society says, the average costs of cases also rose. This was partly because cases took longer to prepare thoroughly. Solicitors had to consider such things as advance disclosure of prosecution statements in criminal cases, while in civil cases the increased burden of discovery of documents and the greater use of expert witnesses drove costs up. Moreover, there was also a significant increase in the hourly rates paid in civil cases as county courts increasingly allowed realistic fee rates following a High Court ruling on the matter. The society also say the foundation's economic analysis of legal aid was wrong. The foundation argued legal aid was subject to 'supplier induced demand'  - services were delivered because lawyers wished to provide them rather than because clients needed them. But that analysis ignored the controls on the grant of legal aid and lawyers costs exercised by the courts and the Legal Aid Board, the society says. Its main objection to the fundholder scheme is that cash-limiting would change legal aid from a service to which all those who meet the qualifying conditions are entitled into a discretionary benefit. That would defeat the purpose of legal aid, which is to enable criminal trials to be conducted fairly and to enable the government to meet its responsibility for ensuring access to justice in civil disputes. Cash-limiting, it argues, would mean the legal aid scheme operated inconsistently in different parts of the country, and at different times of the year, as the money ran out more quickly in some areas than others. It would also enable the government to make covert cuts simply by underfunding the service rather than having to bring regulations before parliament whenever it wanted to change the scheme. Legal aid for challenges to the government could be cut under the guise of giving priority to bread and butter cases. The legal profession recognises that it must live with a tighter legal aid budget in future. The Labour party has made it as clear as have the Conservatives that there will be little additional funding for legal aid. But with legal aid expenditure now under control the case for the draconian measures suggested by the Social Market Foundation has not been made, the society says. A better approach would be to make the justice system itself more affordable. The Lord Chancellor has appointed Lord Woolf, the Law Lord, to review the civil justice system. Solicitors believe Lord Mackay should wait until Lord Woolf reports before taking action which, although popular with the Treasury, would not promote good and open public administration.</p>

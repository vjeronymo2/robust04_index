			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / De Klerk plan for ruling council SOUTH AFRICAN President F W de Klerk yesterday made new proposals for a multi-racial government to rule the country in the transition to a post-apartheid constitution, with South Africans of all races electing as soon as possible a five-member council to govern in the transition. The proposal is an attempt to break a deadlock in negotiations over interim government. The ruling National party and the African National Congress, had agreed that such a council should be appointed, not elected. But they disagreed over its powers. Mr de Klerk said the proposed elected council would comprise one member from each of the three to five biggest political parties, and would have a rotating presidency, changing twice a year. He gave no date for the election, but said it could precede a universal franchise vote for a new parliament to replace the current, race-based assembly. The ANC had no immediate comment but its officials are known to favour an appointed rather than elected council, which would rule for a short time and limit itself to preparing the ground for parliamentary elections rather than taking full responsibility for government. It seems unlikely to accept the proposal.</p>

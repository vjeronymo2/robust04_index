Thai police received information from Washington that Mir  Aimal Kansi, 30, slipped into Thailand in mid-December to hide  in the network of guerrilla and criminal gangs operating here,  according to the source, a senior member of the special branch  who spoke on condition of anonymity.    Kansi was suspected of killing two employees of the Central  Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Virginia on January 25, 1993.    He was also suspected of operating in the same gang as  Muhammad Farooq and Ramzi Ahmad Yousef, suspects in the Febuary  26, 1993 bombing of New York's World Trade Center.    Although Thai police have not received information on  Farooq's or Yousef's whereabouts, they have circulated wanted  posters for all three men in Thai tourist resorts. The posters  offer a US$2 million reward in exchange for information leading  to their arrest.    The source said Thai police had sent three teams to search  for Kansi in the tourist resorts of Pattaya, Phuket and Hat Yai,  one to northern Thailand and two to the Muslim-dominated  provinces of Pattani and Narathiwat.    "But so far there is no clue leading to the suspect," he  said. "We believe he has had cosmetic surgery done to his face,  is carrying false travelling documents and is associating with  international gangsters."    At least a dozen members of international criminal gangs and  guerrilla networks, especially from the Islamic countries of  Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Syria, are operating in  Bangkok, the source said.</p>

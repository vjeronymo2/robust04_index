			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DEFINING WETLANDS IN HUNTINGTON BEACH  </P> <P> Re: Huntington Beach wetlands:  </P> <P> Being an attorney for an involved landowner in the Huntington Beach Wetlands,  Roy B. Woolsey should have used a more scientific definition of wetlands in his  letter ('Dry Land and Wetland,' March 19). Courts generally defer to scientists  or expert agencies on technical matters such as the definition of wetlands.  </P> <P> Wetlands are not defined just on the basis of past survey maps but also, more  importantly, on existing soil and vegetation characteristics peculiar to  wetlands.  </P> <P> In 1984, the Assembly issued a report entitled "Status and Trends of California  Wetlands." This report listed current methods of defining wetlands. For  example, the various agencies define wetlands using criteria such as "saturated  or seasonally saturated soil conditions" and "a prevalence of vegetation  typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions."  </P> <P> If we are to comply with President Bush's campaign position that all existing  wetlands, no matter how small, should be preserved, and if we are to observe  the Environmental Protection Agency's policy stipulating no net loss of  wetlands, then the wetlands along Coast Highway should be described in  scientific documents and preserved, not lost to urban development.  </P> <P> JAN D. VANDERSLOOT  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

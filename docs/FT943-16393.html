			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Credit card repayments bring fall in net lending A big net repayment of credit-card debt resulted in a sharp fall in the level of net lending in May, official figures showed yesterday. The Central Statistical Office said net lending to consumers through finance houses, bank Visa and Mastercard credit cards and non-mortgage building society loans fell to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 203m in May. That was sharply lower than Pounds 412m of net lending in April and below market expectations of Pounds 350m. Analysts pointed out yesterday, however, that the underlying message in the three-monthly figures, which are considered a better guide to the trend than the volatile monthly data, was that consumers were continuing to borrow in spite of tax increases. Net lending in the three months to May was Pounds 1.13bn compared with Pounds 1.11bn in the three months to February. Most of the fall in May's net lending figure came from increased credit card repayment, the CSO's figures showed. Although consumers spent a record Pounds 3.06bn of new credit on their cards in May, there was a net repayment of Pounds 104m as consumers settled their credit card bills faster. This compares with credit-card net lending figures of Pounds 98m in April and Pounds 78m in March. Lending through building society loans fell to Pounds 3m in May from Pounds 14m in April. However new credit advanced by building societies rose to a record Pounds 218m. The CSO said this might reflect a greater level of building society lending 'following the transfer of business from a bank to a building society'. The level of finance house lending - used for car and store credit deals - remained relatively flat at Pounds 304m in May, from Pounds 300m in April. This surprised some analysts, in light of the recent rise in car sales and the relatively strong performance of the white goods sector in May. New borrowing for vehicles fell to Pounds 858m, down from Pounds 871m in April and Pounds 968m in March. New borrowing for the home improvements sector rose to Pounds 67m in May, from Pounds 59m in April. New borrowing on store goods rose to Pounds 238, from Pounds 214m in April.</p>

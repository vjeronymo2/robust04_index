			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> SAROYAN REVIVAL DIPS INTO THE MELTING POT  </P> <P> The so-called American melting pot, that increasingly discredited cliche, once  held the sort of vigor that led many of the most notable playwrights of the  1930s to re-create the pot on the stage.  </P> <P> From Elmer Rice to Clifford Odets and from Sidney Kingsley to Moss Hart, they  celebrated its ethnic splendor, railed against its inequalities, placed its  contradictions on exhibit and generally beckoned its glorious future.  </P> <P> William Saroyan, for instance, describes the 1939 setting for "The Time of Your  Life," which is being revived here by the Professional Actors Conservatory of  Rancho Santiago College, as a specifically "American place." It is a San  Francisco waterfront bar, home to every imaginable neighborhood type.  </P> <P> The Irish are here along with the Italians and the Arabs. The hookers stop by  along with the swells. So do the cops and the dockworkers, the sailors and the  drunks, the newsboys and the con men, the lovelorn and the simply lost. The  place fairly teems with the species Homo Americanus like a zoo on a quietly  domestic Sunday morning.  </P> <P> But in fact, Nick's Pacific Street Saloon, Restaurant and Entertainment Palace  could have existed only in Saroyan's affectionate world, certainly not in the  real one then or now.  </P> <P> The righteous proprietor of Nick's live-and-let-live honky-tonk pours free  drinks, takes a strictly fatherly interest in the local hookers, tosses an  intrusive vice cop on his ear, provides meals as well as work for the  unemployed and gets regular visits from his white-haired old mother.  </P> <P> And Nick isn't even the hallowed saint of this whimsically meandering,  post-Depression paean to the common man.  </P> <P> That honor goes to a gentle Irishman with a bum leg, one of the saloon regulars  named Joe. He sits around drinking champagne, while flirting with the ladies  and dispensing dollar bills from his vest-pocket bankroll to anyone who shows  the slightest need of money. Joe's largess goes so far that it extends beyond  mere acquaintances to anonymous passersby on the street.  </P> <P> When the newsboy arrives to hawk his papers, Joe buys not one but all of them  and tosses them away unread -- a munificent gesture, both charming and cynical.  When desolate Kitty Duvall can't make the rent on her hooker's wages, Joe peels  more bills and pays for her move to a better hotel. When his gofer, Tom, needs  a fresh start in love and in life, Joe arranges everything.  </P> <P> Because "The Time of Your Life" is virtually all texture and no plot, a series  of acting "moments" strung out over nearly three hours, the strength of any  production is particularly dependent on the quality of the players. Meanwhile,  the very reasons that make it a difficult play to negotiate -- 26 speaking  roles, for example -- also make it a desirable choice for a training program.  </P> <P> Victor's Pappas' PAC staging happily manages to finesse the problem of cast  inexperience with directorial clarity and several nicely shaped collegiate  performances, despite a glaring weakness in the central role of Joe, wanly  played by Phillip Beck (the lone professional actor and, ironically, the  conservatory director).  </P> <P> If Mark Ciglar gives the comedy's most extroverted and entertaining performance  as Kit Carson, a Western old-timer with a con man's gift of gab and a skein of  eccentric stories, Darin Heames gives the most authentic performance as Dudley,  a bespectacled young man desperately trying to connect with the woman he loves  on the saloon's public telephone.  </P> <P> But the real test of the production's authenticity comes in the roles of Harry,  the would-be hoofer-comedian who wants to break into show business, and Wesley,  the starving drifter whose talent for noodling on the piano turns into gainful  employment.  </P> <P> As Harry, Pete Benson somehow creates the illusion that he can do a bit of soft  shoe, though he doesn't really seem a dancer. But, much more than that, Benson  captures the yearning innocence that one imagines Gene Kelly projecting as the  original Harry in the Broadway production. In his climactic speech, which is  one of the subtler peaks of the play, Benson achieves a wonderful, double-edged  flush of emotion.  </P> <P> Wesley, a totally self-effacing role that reflects a certain amount of racial  stereotyping, has less importance as a character but is essential to the  texture of the play just the same. Saroyan calls him "a colored boy" in his  stage directions, and he is supposed to be portrayed by a black actor. Here he  is played by David Fraioli, who is white.  </P> <P> Given the choice of casting someone with the right skin color who can't play  the piano or someone with the wrong skin color who can, Pappas made the  appropriate move. It would have been disconcerting to listen to canned music  for the piano tunes that compose so much of the play's aural backdrop.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, James Rice gives a solid-as-rock portrayal of Nick. Sam Zeller  brings a blushing energy to the boyish Tom. Betsy Ferguson has the right look  as Kitty, though she needs more personal allure.  </P> <P> Notable cameos include Barth L. Maher as the union intellectual McCarthy, Dan  Cole as the sadistic vice cop Blick, Terra Shelman as an enthralled society  lady and Jeff Hutcherson as a drunk who bounces off the furniture like a  billiard ball.  </P> <P> Mention must also be made of the attractive set, particularly the red-and-blue  jukebox that plays and replays "The Missouri Waltz," and the "American Destiny"  pinball machine, a flag-waving contraption that is played nonstop for the  entire length of the show by Todd Terry as the silently obsessive pinball whiz  Willie.  </P> <P> 'THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE'  </P> <P> A production of Rancho Santiago College's PAC Theatre Company.

			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ON CAMPUS: COLLEGE OF THE CANYONS;  </P> <P> LEASING OF PARKING LOTS TO SWAP MEET FIRM IS APPROVED  </P> <P> The College of the Canyons in Santa Clarita has approved allowing a private  company to use campus parking lots to conduct weekend swap meets in exchange  for fees of more than $144,000.  </P> <P> The Santa Clarita Community College District Board of Trustees voted this week  to allow the Santa Clarita Valley Swap Meet Inc. to rent the college's lower  parking lots.  </P> <P> In addition to paying a monthly fee of $12,000, the swap meet organizers would  be responsible for setting up the meets and cleaning up afterward. College  events that conflicted with the swap meets would take precedence.  </P> <P> "The reason this is an attractive offer is because the parking lots are in  desperate need of repair," College President-Supt. Dianne Van Hook said. "This  would allow us to repair them and hire additional needed security."  </P> <P> She said it would also make it possible to continue allowing students to park  for free.  </P> <P> A contract between Nazareth A. Chobanian and Sabu Chitjian, from the swap meet  firm, and the COC Foundation, whose purpose is to raise money for the college,  is to be signed after the college examines the firm's financial backing,  officials said.  </P> <P> The swap meets could begin Memorial Day weekend.  </P></p>

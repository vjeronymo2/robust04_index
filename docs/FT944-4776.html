			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Celebrities line up for road protest Protest groups fighting proposals to build or widen roads across environmentally sensitive land and near houses are signing up celebrity support across the country. The Department of Transport's plan to build an 11-mile stretch of dual carriageway close to the existing A27 north of Lewes in East Sussex is one proposal which has attracted much celebrity support. Designed to facilitate east-west traffic, particularlycoming off the M23 around Brighton and Lewes, it will cut through the South Downs, an area of outstanding natural beauty. The 1,000-member A27 Action Group, formed in January, counts among its backers Sir Dirk Bogarde, the actor, Lord Healey, the former chancellor of the exchequer, and Lord Skidelsky, the economist and political historian. With such heavyweight opponents the road's backers, which include East Sussex County Council and local chambers of commerce, will have their work cut out in the publicity war. The road is on the DoT's priority two list, so it may not be built for ten years. A public inquiry is not likely for another two years at least. Mr Nick Davies, secretary of the A27 Action Group, said the road would cost Pounds 70m and be the biggest construction project ever in the area.' It would cause considerable damage to our homes, our countryside and our health,' he said. He said that there had already been too much development along the south coast and disputed the economic case for the development. Mr Bob Wilkins, East Sussex county engineer, rejected comparisons with Twyford Down, where the M3 extension was the subject of a bitter protest. He said: 'There is not a physical cut through the downs like there was at Twyford. The road will run around the side of Mount Cabourn. It will be a dual carriageway, not a superhighway. It will not be lit along the route, as critics have suggested. It is true there will be an elevated ramp going up to 35 feet. But this will be of short duration. Proper landscaping could make the ramp unobtrusive.' The county council wants the extension to help with tourism - the county's main industry - and to help fill a number of small industrial estates. Mr Robert Caffyn, a local industrialist, has written: 'Tourists enjoy Eastbourne when they arrive but complain bitterly about the last part of the journey. Large employers have left the town largely because of poor access.' The council says that the A27 is dangerous, with too much traffic, too many blind bends and too many accidents. It said that in the first six months of the year the number of accidents doubled compared with the same period of last year. Mr Davies agreed that the road was dangerous and inadequate. 'But that does not mean you have to build a new road,' he said. Black spots could be converted to dual carriageway 'as an interim measure'.</p>

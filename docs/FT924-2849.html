			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries slip ahead of inflation figures MODEST profit-taking pushed US Treasury prices slightly lower across the board yesterday as bond investors awaited today's inflation data. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/32 at 102 3/16 , yielding 7.436 per cent. The two-year note was also lower, down  3/32 at 100 1/32 , yielding 4.591 per cent. Although the market isconfident inflationary pressures are not building up in the economy, despite signs of growing business activity, prices edged lower as some investors booked profits earned in the recent rally. Apart from the profit-taking, trading was subdued. The day's only economic report was the release of the Federal Reserve's 'Beige Book' - its end-of-year survey of business conditions across the US - which confirmed economic activity is picking up pace. After the report came out prices recouped some of their early losses. THE Bundesbank's repo allocation yesterday provided the main focus for the German government bond market as the central bank injected funds and raised the minimum rate at which they were allocated. The Liffe bund futures contract, which opened at 91.58, rose to a high of 91.74 before ending at around 91.67. Volumes were low, with around 18,000 contracts traded, as dealers warned some market participants had closed their books for the year or were waiting for the Bundesbank's Council meeting today and the Edinburgh EC summit at the weekend for any signs of an easing in the key German interest rates. At yesterday's repo tender for 14-day funds, the Bundesbank allocated DM77bn, adding a net DM6.5bn to the market. The lowest allocated rate shifted up to 8.80 per cent from 8.78 per cent last week, which reflects the recent rise in German money market rates. The injection of funds helped to lift the short end of the bund market, dealers said. The Bundesbank is expected to announce its M3 money supply growth target for 1993 today. The market expects the target to be raised from the current 3.5 to 5.5 per cent range to 4 to 6 per cent. CALLS for a cut in the base rate helped to lift UK government bonds early in the session and the gilt market closed higher on the day. Two of the seven-strong panel of advisers recently appointed to help the Treasury forecasting team were quoted yesterday urging a 2 percentage point cut in the base rate to 5 per cent. The news buoyed short-dated gilts, but the fall in sterling against the D-Mark later wiped out some of the early gains, dealers said. The Liffe gilt futures contract rose from 99.20 at the opening to end at around 99.31. JAPANESE government bonds edged higher, helped by short-covering late in the trading session. But traders said the market was focusing on tomorrow's Bank of Japan Tankan report, the quarterly economic survey. The survey is likely to show worsening business sentiment and could revive hopes of a cut in the official discount rate. The March futures contract rose from 107.70 to end at 107.84, while the yield on the benchmark No 145 traded in a narrow range of 4.585-4.61 per cent, ending the day at 4.59 per cent.</p>

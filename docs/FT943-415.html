			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / UniChem eyes big time with Pounds 58m cash call UniChem, the acquisitive pharmaceuticals retailer and wholesaler, yesterday announced a Pounds 58.4m rights issue to underpin its expansion as one of Britain's largest suppliers of healthcare products. The group plans to use the funds to wipe out short-term borrowings, acquire retail outlets and move into other health-related businesses. Acquisition strategies were cited in two other rights issues announced yesterday by Jefferson Smurfit, the Irish paper and packaging company, and Cattle's Holdings, the consumer credit group. Smurfit outlined plans to raise IPounds 155m (Pounds 152m) to partly fund its acquisition of the paper and packaging business of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, the French glass and building materials group, while Cattle's said it was seeking Pounds 27.9m for the purchase of two new subsidiaries. At UniChem, Mr Jeff Harris, chief executive, said the move was vital if the group was to pursue an expansion which it started by spending Pounds 165.6m on acquisitions and warehouse automation in the past three years, Pounds 49.9m of it in the six months to June 30. Announcing a 17 per cent increase in first half profits, he said: 'We could not maintain our growth without increased gearing or a rights issue. This is the best option.' UniChem slipped 22p to 276p after the group priced the one-for-six rights issue at 245p - an 18 per cent discount to Tuesday's close. If fully taken up, the issue of 24.4m shares - underwritten by Barclays de Zoete Wedd and UBS - would eliminate borrowings leaving the group with about Pounds 35.4m in cash. Most of the group's new funds are expected to be invested in new retail outlets, although UniChem has targeted surgical equipment and hospital supplies as areas for expansion. While some City analysts welcomed the strategy, others warned that government-imposed price cuts on prescription medicines and competition from supermarkets and made the prospects for pharmacies uncertain. 'They should invest more in wholesale than retailing, that's where the growth opportunities are,' said one analyst. Improved performances at Unichem lifted interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 18m to Pounds 21m, on turnover ahead 11 per cent from Pounds 574.1m to Pounds 637.7m. The group, which is forecast to make full-year profits of about Pounds 44m, shrugged off the effects of a 2.5 per cent price cut on prescription medicines increasing operating margins from 3.37 per cent to 3.5 per cent. Earnings per share rose from 8.6p to 9.6p basic or 9.3p (8.3p) fully diluted. The interim dividend has been increased from 2.2p to 2.5p. Rights resurgence Smurfit and Cattle's issues, Page 22</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Bank of Japan expects gentle pick-up in domestic economy Japan could be near the bottom of its protracted recession, the country's central bank said yesterday in its latest quarterly survey of business conditions. Business confidence has stopped weakening and the climate is expected to improve, the Bank of Japan said in its February survey of more than 10,000 companies. The Tankan index of manufacturers' confidence stagnated at minus 56, the same as in the previous survey in November, staying at the lowest point in the downturn since May 1991. The index, which gives the percentage balance between companies reporting favourable and poor conditions, is forecast to recover slightly to minus 50 by June. A 'gentle' economic recovery is expected some time during the fiscal year starting next month, said Mr Kagehide Kaku, the bank's head of research and statistics. The Tankan survey is the most authoritative gauge of the short-term business outlook and an important influence on monetary policy. But several private sector economists feared the central bank was optimistic, and said a cut in official discount rates, widely expected, was needed to stimulate spending and investment. If US president Bill Clinton succumbs to pressure for trade sanctions against Japan, the consequent rise in the yen would delay recovery prospects, they warned. The yen stood at about Y109 to the dollar when the survey was taken, against Y104 at which it has traded in recent days. 'Japan's economy is brain-dead. There is no pulse, but at least that is better than seeing the readings fall lower,' said Mr Kenneth Courtis, senior economist at Deutsche Bank Capital Markets Asia. Conditions have worsened for small manufacturers - usually an early warning of changes in trend - where the index fell from minus 45 to minus 48. The balance of manufacturers reporting excess capacity rose from 32 to 35 while those with surplus staff rose from 26 to 28. There were some encouraging signs in the survey, the Bank of Japan said, but not enough to amount to clear evidence of the recovery. Large manufacturers, outside the oil industry, expect pre-tax profits to fall 29.7 per cent in the current fiscal year, the fourth year of profits decline, but to recover by 11.4 per cent in 1994. Japan's suspected credit squeeze may also be easing, on the strength of an increase in the balance of companies to report that banks were being helpful in their credit stance.

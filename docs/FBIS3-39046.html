			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Prosperity Party [PP] leader Necmettin Erbakan has  said that when the PP comes to power there will be economic  development and Turkey will be turned into a leading country.    At a meeting in Mugla, Erbakan stated that the parties that  have been governing Turkey for the past 50 years have brought  misery on the people. He alleged that because of the practice  of charging interest, the country's economy is collapsing. Our  correspondent Omer Kebabcioglu reports that Erbakan explained  that interest affects prices.    [Begin Erbakan recording] Everything is being done on the  basis of interest in this country. Interest is written off as  expenses and is included in the price of goods. Ultimately, it  is you, the citizens, who pay for all the interest paid in the  banks. The interest crushes you. Look, one third of my jacket  is interest. One third of my shoes is interest. One third of  cheese is interest. Everything is interest. You pay for the  interest in the end, because you voted for those who believe in  interest. On the other hand taxes are levied on profits, and  profits are made on sold goods. Profits are included in the  prices. This means that the low income groups pay for all the  taxes paid.    What I am saying is that when the PP establishes a just  order, it will lift all this interest. [end recording]    Addressing meetings in Denizli and Afyon, Erbakan charged  that the government is pursuing the wrong foreign policy. On  the massacre in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Erbakan said that it a shame  for humanity that the world is remaining passive before these  savage acts. He stressed that the United States and the world  do not want to intervene, adding: They want to see the Muslims  eliminated.    Erbakan said that the government is compromising regarding  Cyprus. Only we will be able to solve foreign policy problems,  he said.</p>

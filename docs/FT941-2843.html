			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Fund income boosts Swiss lift group Schindler, the world's second largest elevator and escalator group after Otis of the US, has reported a 52.3 per cent jump in consolidated net profit for 1993 to SFr168.6m (Dollars 117.6m), thanks entirely to earnings from liquid funds. The Lucerne-based group said revenues were flat at SFr4.5bn and trading profits were near 1992 levels in spite of the difficult economic environment and negative foreign currency effects. New orders were up 5 per cent to SFr4.4bn but orders on hand slid 6.7 per cent to SFr2.67bn.</p>

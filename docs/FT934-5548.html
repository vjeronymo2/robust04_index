			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Inventor scorns worries about cost of Euro-plug An inventor campaigning for a harmonised European plug and socket system has hit back at claims from UK manufacturers that replacing the UK's three-pin system could cost Pounds 20bn and raise serious safety issues. Mr Simon Hossack, a Hertfordshire-based inventor, says the adoption in the UK of a proposed new two-pin plug would stimulate the contracting and cable industries, be of great benefit to appliance manufacturers and save consumers hundreds of millions of pounds a year. Mr Hossack's attack is the latest salvo in an increasingly bitter debate in the electrical industry over the future of the UK's 13-amp plug with its three rectangular pins, introduced in 1947. Last month Mr David Dossett, director of the Electrical Installation Equipment Manufacturers Association, said the two-pin system: Could cost about Pounds 1,000 to introduce for each of 20m UK households. Would make redundant about half of the Pounds 1.3bn capital employed by the UK's 20 plug and socket manufacturers. Could raise an issue of 'dangerous compatibility', because the present two-pin Euro-plug could be pushed into a three-pin socket with potentially lethal consequences. But Mr Hossack, who in the late 1980s invented Le Plug, an adaptor that allows the Euro-plug to run on the British system, described the association's arguments as 'absolute tosh' and deliberate misrepresentation. He said the proposed new harmonised plug, which has thicker pins than the existing Euro-plug, cannot be fitted into a UK socket, and even the Euro-plug could only be inserted through deliberate misuse. The Pounds 20bn figure, he said, was a worst-case scenario that would never become reality. With an adaptor such as Le Plug there would be no need to replace plugs and sockets, and new houses could be fitted with the new sockets. He said it was inconceivable that the costs for manufacturers of replacing equipment with lathes to produce round pins would amount to Pounds 650m. The association says it does not oppose harmonisation but is trying to kill the new plug, which has been proposed by Cenelec, the European standards setting body, and could eventually become the world standard. Mr Hossack wants an investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and the European Commission's competition directorate into the issue and its handling by the British Standards Institution. He claims UK manufacturers are over-represented on the institution's plugs and sockets committee, which meets today to discuss the issue. The institution rejects the charge, and says the committee includes manufacturers, consumers, safety experts and academics.</p>

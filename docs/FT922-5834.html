			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / The Cadbury Report: Labour attacks voluntary approach THE REPORT was greeted with some disappointment by Ms Marjorie Mowlam, who speaks for Labour on corporate affairs, but it was welcomed by ministers. Ms Mowlam questioned the efficacy of peer group pressure as a way of enforcing the code of practice and warned that the use of a voluntary code might amount to a 'recipe for inactivity'. She said: 'We have had best-practice codes before - from the Association of British Insurers and from the Institutional Shareholders Committee. I am not sure they ever go far enough.' She highlighted areas where she believed the report should have gone further, commenting on its 'rather vague' reference to companies finding new ways of working with shareholders. She said that it could have proposed simplified annual reports or training for shareholders. A further weakness was the report's comments on the role of non-executive directors because they did not address where they might be found and whether they should be trained. Ms Mowlam also commented that, if the report were serious in addressing the issue of boardroom pay, it would have recommended that annual meetings should be able to vote on directors' salaries. She was disappointed the report did not offer fundamental change, and warned that as business activity recovered in the 1990s, the same drawbacks would re-emerge. 'Practical guidelines should have been laid down,' she said. She welcomed some elements in the document, such as the proposed extension of statutory protection for auditors reporting reasonable suspicion of fraud. Mr Neil Hamilton, the corporate affairs minister, said the report was a valuable contribution to the debate on improving corporate governance. In particular, he applauded the idea of a voluntary code of practice, hailing it as 'an important step forward in improving corporate governance'. The Department of Trade and Industry emphasised that the report was a draft. The government would look again at it in the light of the comments it attracted.</p>

			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / People: Hoare Govett The latest move in the on-going shuffle of City economists is that of Mark Brown from UBS Securities. Brown, 30, has been appointed head of strategy and economics at Hoare Govett where he will be responsible for the macro-economic research department covering the UK and Europe. Brown (above) started his working life as an economist at the Confederation of British Industry, before moving on to the Treasury in 1984. There, under the eye of Rachel Lomax, now deputy secretary in charge of financial institutions, he helped develop a method for working out the number of individual shareholders in the wake of the privatisations of the early 1980s. An occasional rock-climber, but now more devoted to his 18-month old son than to outdoor pursuits, Brown worked at UBS for seven years. He takes up his post at Hoare Govett sometime towards the end of the year. In another move, Mark Brett, director of bond and currency strategy at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, has announced that he is leaving in September to join investment advisory firm, Capital International.</p>

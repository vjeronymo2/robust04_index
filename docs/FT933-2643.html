			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: RJB set to bid for large part of British Coal RJB Mining, the recently-floated mining group, said yesterday it expected to bid for a large section of British Coal in the forthcoming privatisation, as it declared interim profits up 25 per cent to Pounds 5.55m which were at the top end of expectations. Mr Richard Budge, chairman, said he was delighted by government indications that it planned to break up the corporation into five parts. He expected to be a bidder for at least one of the main sections. RJB has already submitted tenders to mine under licence five pits which are no longer wanted by British Coal, although one - for Easington in the north-east of England - has been withdrawn. It plans to bid for up to seven more if British Coal starts to effect closures among 12 pits reprieved by the government in March. The City approved of RJB's performance for the half year to June 30, lifting the shares by 10p to 269p. RJB's profits, which compared with Pounds 4.45m last time, were achieved on turnover of Pounds 37.74m (Pounds 37.3m). The result enabled RJB to declare an interim dividend of 5p, covered 1.83 times.</p>

			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO;  </P> <P> INJURED WOMAN FOUND BESIDE ROAD  </P> <P> A 34-year-old woman with severe head injuries was found on the side of a road  near a Camarillo neighborhood early Friday.  </P> <P> Rita Calloway, a transient from the Oxnard area, was listed in serious  condition with a skull fracture at St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard  on Friday evening, a hospital spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Detectives believe that Calloway either was pushed from a moving car or struck  with an object on Santa Rosa Road near Morongo Drive, said Lt. Gary Backman of  the Ventura County Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> A real estate agent taking down signs in the area about 1 a.m. found the woman,  who was semiconscious and bleeding profusely from a head wound, Backman said.  </P> <P> The agent called the Sheriff's Department and showed deputies where she had  found the woman, a site about 80 yards from the back yard of a large house,  said Sgt. Paul Oechsle of the Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> The woman was taken to Pleasant Valley Hospital in Camarillo and later  transferred to St. John's Regional Medical Center, Backman said.  </P> <P> No one heard or saw any vehicles or disturbances, Oechsle said.  </P> <P> Detectives investigating the case are not releasing information about possible  motives or specifics of the attack, Backman said.  </P> <P> But they have not ruled out the possibility that the attack might be linked to  the beating of Michelle Green in Ventura on May 5, said Cmdr. Raymond Abbott of  the Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> Green was found unconscious behind a large dumpster in the 800 block of  Poinsettia Place.  </P> <P> "I don't think we can ignore any possibilities," Abbott said.  </P> <P> The Ventura Police Department has investigated many leads in the Green case but  is not close to finding a suspect, Lt. Jay Wilson of the Police Department  said.  </P> <P> Green remains in guarded condition at the Ventura County Medical Center, where  she occasionally opens her eyes but is unable to communicate, a hospital  spokeswoman said.

Prices of spiral steel, sheet steel, and channel  iron have increased by 150 yuan per tonne. The demand on wire  rods is the greatest and some steel works have raised their  producer prices by 300 yuan at one go. The price of wire rods  in some futures markets for for transactions to be completed in  June this year has risen to 3,960 yuan per tonne, and has even  exceeded 4,000 yuan per tonne. Compared with the price of 3,000  yuan per tonne at the beginning of this year, this sharp  increase is over 30 percent.    This reporter has been "running round" iron and steel  enterprises for some time and has recently been asked frequently  by people: Is it normal or abnormal for prices of construction  steels to soar at present?    My answer can only be regarded as my personal view: Viewed  from the law of value and from the supply and demand  relationship, there is no reason for prices of construction  steels to soar at present or this year.    Are soaring prices caused by short supply on the  market, demand being greater than supply, or a drastic fall in  stocks? Evidently not.    According to an analysis by Wu Xichun, vice minister and  information spokesman of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry,  this year, forecasted according to the scale of social  investment in fixed assets and the scale of credit arranged to  meet the target of an increase in GNP of 9-10 percent compared  with last year, the increase in the total volume of steel  consumed for the whole year will be 5.4 to 7.5 percent over the  actual volume consumed last year. The estimated total volume of  steel resources for the whole year is: 81 million tonnes  produced in China, 9 million tonnes of stocks in society, and  some steels which are in short supply will be imported. This  means that so long as domestic steel production remains normal  and the use of 9 million tonnes in stock in society is ensured,  the supply-demand relationship in the steel market this year  will be more or less in balance and price rises caused by a  shortage of supply will not occur.    Some people may ask: Will the 9 million tonnes of steels in  stock in society become the plums one "thinks of in an attempt  to quench a thirst" or the cake "drawn to allay hunger?" It  seems quite certain that the answer is also no. Last year,  China imported a total of 30.26 million tonnes of steel, and  more than half of that arrived after the State Council  strengthened macro regulation and control over the economy in  July, and 4.45 million tonnes arrived in December. According to  calculations based on the rate of steel consumption during that  period, it was totally impossible for China's construction,  machine-building, and electrical industries to have consumed  more than 20 million tonnes of steel in less than half a year.  According to statistics from the State Statistics Bureau, steel  stored by state-owned enterprises at the end of last year was  about 19 percent more than at the beginning of last year.  Besides, stocks at various iron and steel works at the end of  last year were over 150 percent more than at the beginning of  last year. The above shows that there is a big margin of safety  in the plan to use 9 million tons of steel stocks in society  this year.    Is will be difficult to turn out 81 million tonnes of steel  this year since the internal and external conditions for the  production of iron and steel are not good? They are not. As  early as the first half of last year, average daily steel output  for three months was 220,000 tonnes, equivalent to an annual  output of 80.3 million tonnes. Moreover, in the second half of  last year and this year, a number of new, renovated, or expanded  projects were put into operation. The production situation  since January this year is even better: Compared with the same  period of 1993, iron output has increased by 369,000 tonnes, or  5.66 percent; steel output by 558,000 tonnes, or 8.15 percent;  and output of special steels by 729,800 tonnes or 13.08 percent.  The range of increase for special steels was wider than that  for basic steel, which was wider than for iron. This is  precisely what people engaged in the metallurgical industry want.    Is this a chain reaction in the domestic market caused  by a rise in the price of steel on the international market? It  is not.    The price of steel on the international market inevitably  becomes an objective standard for the rise and fall of the price  of steels in the domestic market following the institution of  the socialist market economy structure. However, the relevant  data show that the $15 rise for each tonne of hot-rolled sheet  steel and coated sheet steel on the U.S. market at the beginning  of this year was caused by anti-dumping policies against steel  imports implemented by the United States last year, which held  back imports, and by rising labor costs in domestic steel works,  whose output could not meet market demand. In Europe, on the  one hand, low-price Russian steel are being sold on the market,  and, on the other hand, each country's steel works are finding  it difficult to realize their wish to raise prices because of a  slow economic recovery. In Japan, the six major iron and steel  corporations are suffering losses. They of course want to raise  prices to some extent, but in the first half of this year, since  the economic recession had not yet ended and steel exports to  China had dropped by a big margin, the objective environment did  not permit rising prices. Viewed then from the major  steel-producing countries round the world, no considerable rise  in the price of steel has occurred. Therefore, there are no  grounds for a big rise in the price of steel in China.    Has seasonal demand for steel led to a rise in the  price of steels? Evidently not!    It was extremely cold in January and February, and many  capital construction projects north of the Chang Jiang had to be  suspended or slow down their construction progress because of  the climate. On construction sites south of the Chang Jiang,  most workers come from other localities, and they made use of  the New Year-Spring Festival period to go home and see their  relatives. This objectively led to a "lax season" in the use of  steel. This can be seen from steel prices in some futures  markets: prices were not high for January and February, and the  highest prices are found in June and July.    Have readjustments in coal, electricity, and  transportation prices raised producer price of steel leading to  a rise in futures prices? Much less is the case!    On the whole, producer prices of wire rods from various  steel  works at present have recovered slightly compared with the  fourth quarter, and it should be said that the shadow of an  abrupt fall in prices last year has just gone. At present,  various steel works are, in accordance with the demands of the  Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and through the Metallurgical  Product Price Coordination Committee, seriously summing up  experiences and lessons of the major fluctuations in prices in  1993. They have formed a preliminary view: Steel works hope  the price of steels will not go out of control. This is because  letting things drift leads to abrupt rises and falls in the  price of steel, which will not be conducive to the readjustment  of the structure of the metallurgical industry, the formation of  a competitive mechanism for the survival of the fittest among  enterprises, the normal production and operational activities of  enterprises, the healthy development of other sectors of the  national economy, and the stability of the entire society. Last  year, many small unlicensed workshops were set up to produce  steel and large quantities of poor quality steel were found.  Over 30 million tonnes of steel was unnecessarily imported, of  which construction steel accounted for half the total. An  important reason was that the price of steel was too high and  immense profits could be reaped. All large and medium sized  iron and steel works expressed their determination to seriously  make good use of their rights to set product prices and to  adhere to four principles in setting prices: ensuring  reasonable profits for enterprises under normal production  conditions, giving full consideration to market demand, using  international market prices as reference, and paying attention  to maintaining cooperation with major users and long-term users.    "How should we look at the rise in construction steel prices  at present after so much has been said?"    In fact, my view is quite clear: There is no shortage of  steel on the market, demand for steel is not excessive, the  amount of steel in stock is not small, steel production is  normal, and increases in the price of steel abroad are not big.  If the price of steel is artificially raised by means of  "speculation," such activities can only be called "blind  activities." As Wu Xichun, vice minister and information  spokesman of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, put it:  The emergence of so-called "short supply and soaring prices" in  the steel market is an abnormal phenomenon and a false market  signal.</p>

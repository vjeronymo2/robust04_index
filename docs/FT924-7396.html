			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Bar backs late sittings for small-claims courts THE BAR called on the government yesterday to set up a limited pilot scheme to extend the opening hours of magistrates' courts and small-claims courts from 5.30pm until 8.30pm. A working party set up last year to look at the need for extended court hours said in its report that people running small businesses might not be able to afford to take time off work to pursue claims. The frequency of night sittings would depend on demand but at the outset would be three times a week every second week. Ms Anesta Weekes, head of working party, said the court system had to be run more with the interests of the consumer in mind. Extended hours would also encourage defendants involved in minor cases to attend court rather than plead guilty by post, she said. Defendants arrested late in the day could be bailed by magistrates instead of being remanded in custody overnight. In magistrates' courts evening sessions would be limited to certain types of case, including bail applications; minor motoring offences; non-payment of fines; and guilty pleas where there was no risk of a custodial penalty. Using court buildings for longer periods would reduce delays and cut the backlog of cases, Ms Weekes said. The working party studied the experience of courts in New York, which have been opening in the evenings and throughout the night for more than 20 years, and an experiment of evening sessions at Uxbridge magistrates' court, west London, last year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The vice chairman of the Presidential Council,  Brother 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Ali al-Jifri, said that what had been  reported in the media as a statement by him to the French news  agency, AFP -- that the Democratic Republic of Yemen would ask  for military assistance from the brotherly Kingdom of Saudi  Arabia -- had never happened.    In a statement to the Yemeni NEWS AGENCY, Aden, al-Jifri  said  that the Democratic Republic of Yemen had made no decision to  ask for military intervention from any side. He stated that  what had happened was that he had replied to a question by AFP  on whether the Democratic Republic of Yemen would seek military  assistance from any quarter by saying that such a decision had  not yet been made, but that anything was possible, and that if  we decided to demand anything, we would ask the United Nations  to act on Resolution No. 924.    The vice chairman added that there was no mention in his  reply concerning any country which held our trust and pride,  such as our brothers in the Gulf Cooperation Council -- the  Republic of Egypt, Syria, and the rest of Arab countries.    The vice chairman said that when questioned on this matter,  the AFP correspondent denied that he had filed this statement,  or that his agency had published this version of the story.</p>

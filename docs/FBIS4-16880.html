			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Apr 18, BNS -- Latvian Saeima (parliament)  Deputy Speaker Andrejs Krastins met on Monday [18 April] with  U.S. State Department's political experts Julie Cohen, Martin  Schwartz and U.S. Embassy in Latvia Secretary Scott Dean.    The group discussed relations between Latvia and Russia and  problems related to Latvia's draft citizenship law.    Krastins also pointed to shortcomings in the initialed  Latvian- Russian agreements on troop withdrawal.    The package fails to demand compensation for Russian damages  to Latvia, allows Russian forces to retain ownership rights on  real estate and tolerates foundation of Latvian-Russian joint  ventures on the basis of former military installations, said  Krastins.    Krastins reiterated that Latvia is interested to receive  international guarantees for the process of the signature of the  troop withdrawal package and the control of its implementation.    Dean voiced his country's support for the conclusion of an  interstate agreement that would fully resolve the issue of  Russian troop withdrawal from Latvia.</p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Savimbi willing to seek peace, says Botha MR PIK BOTHA, South African foreign minister, said yesterday Mr Jonas Savimbi, Angola's rebel Unita leader, was willing to seek peace in the country, Reuter reports from Pretoria. He told a news conference he had spoken to Mr Savimbi on Wednesday following fighting between Unita forces and Angolan government troops that killed some 1,200. 'He indicated firmly and clearly his willingness, despite tremendous emotional stress, to continue with the democratic process. . .and play a constructive role,' Mr Botha said. There was no immediate response from the government in Luanda, which South Africa informed about the conversation. But Angolan diplomats in Lisbon said government and Unita officials had held talks to end fighting in the towns of Lobito and Benguela. The last pockets of fighting in the capital Luanda appeared to have died down. The European Community, meanwhile, said it would hold any party that blocked the peace process responsible for its actions. A statement issued in London called on all parties to abide by a ceasefire negotiated by the United Nations on Monday. The ex-Marxist MPLA won United Nations-supervised elections which Mr Savimbi later denounced as a fraud.</p>

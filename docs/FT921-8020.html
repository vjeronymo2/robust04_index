			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Another sterling day for dollar THE dollar powered ahead on the foreign exchanges yesterday, reaching its highest level in three months against the D-Mark, writes Peggy Hollinger. The US unit closed 2.5 pfennigs stronger at DM1.6480 in London, after having enjoyed an early morning surge that carried it as high as DM1.6515. Although the dollar fell back slightly, dealers said they expected it to trade in a new range, which could see the US currency as high as DM1.70 in the near term. In New York the dollar eased to DM1.6440. Although the dollar's recent rallies had been rumoured to be the result of speculative buying out of the Middle East, there was evidence that yesterday's rise was due to long-term players, such as investment trusts. Economists expected the dollar to continue its rise this week, albeit at a much slower pace than recently. Tomorrow's Humphrey Hawkins address to Congress from Federal Reserve chairman Mr Alan Greenspan is expected to add further fuel to the dollar's rise. The US currency was trading on the alleged brink of intervention against the yen, bumping up against the Y128 level for most of the day. It closed in London at Y128.00, compared with Y126.95 on Monday. By the afternoon in New York, the dollar was trading higher still, but it finished back at Y127.93. Rumours were rife that the US Fed had been checking prices, sparking fears of intervention. Fears of Bundesbank intervention, and rumours that the German central bank had also been checking prices, kept the D-Mark from weakening even further against the dollar. However, market sentiment now appears to be firmly set against the D-Mark. Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, reinforced this view with comments which implied that even if money supply figures out this week were far worse than expected, the German central bank would not change monetary policy. The German unit weakened against the yen, falling to Y77.54. Dealers said they expected the next D-Mark/yen resistance level to focus on Y77.30. Sterling crept up slightly against the D-Mark, and just edged into the narrow band of the European exchange rate mechanism against the D-Mark. However, sterling's rise was more the result of a weaker German unit, rather than any inherent strength. The pound finished at DM2.8850, compared with DM2.88 on Monday. Speculation of a UK interest rate cut before the general election appeared to have little effect on sterling. The tension within the ERM grid increased last night, as the peseta reached its uppermost limit against sterling. The Spanish currency closed at Pta 180.61 to the pound. The D-Mark turned in the weakest performance in the European Monetary System, although it was cushioned against the lira by intervention from the Bank of Italy. The German unit ended at L750.55, against L750.12 on Monday.</p>

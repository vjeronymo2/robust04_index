			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Nato agreement on joint peacekeeping THE NATO Co-operation Council, grouping 37 Nato members and former Soviet and east European associated states, agreed yesterday to joint preparations for peacekeeping activities, including joint planning and training sessions. However, there was still a question mark over the extent to which France, which is not a member of Nato's integrated military command, is prepared to participate in such co-operative activities. The final communique said the countries of the North Atlantic Co-operation Council were ready to support and contribute on a case-by-case basis to peacekeeping operations under United Nations authority or the responsibility of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. Earlier in the meeting, Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the US secretary of state, had indicated that France was still reserving its position on any joint preparations by the members states and their associates for peacekeeping missions. But Mr Manfred Worner, the Nato secretary-general, maintained at a press conference that this problem had been overcome. What is certain is that, while France is fully prepared to participate in any Nato peacekeeping activities at the request of the UN, it wants to avoid giving the impression that it is rejoining the alliance's integrated military command.</p>

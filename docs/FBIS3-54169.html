			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Second Friday prayers sermon by Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati in </F> Tehran on 21 January -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The reappearance of the hidden  imam [12th Shiite imam, believed to have gone into occultation  in AD 874] requires certain preparatory stages. It will not  happen without preliminaries and miraculously. The groundwork  must be laid. That is probably why the period of absence [of  the Hidden Imam] lasts so long. The groundwork must be laid.  Some of the preliminaries are voluntary and some non-voluntary.    The non-voluntary parts relate to the fact that human beings  keep moving in certain directions and running into obstacles.  Human beings who are against cruelty, against war, against  poverty, against ignorance keep falling into this or that  person's trap. They keep being misled by politicians and power  holders; they keep being pulled in different directions and keep  running into dead- ends. They must experience many dead-ends  and reach a point where divine leaders and the protectors of  revelation are the only ones who can save and guide humanity.  They must reach a stage where they are prepared for the  acceptance of the hidden imam and God's caliphate. In other  words, things must reach such a pass that humanity despairs of  saving itself. Things must reach that stage and they are  reaching that stage. We are moving in that direction. That is  one part of the groundwork: the non-voluntary preparations.    The voluntary preparations: justice-seekers, worshippers of  God and those who believe in this hidden imam must prepare  themselves decisively. Certain movements must come into  existence. Movements which oppose oppression, revolutions which  oppose bullying must come into existence; revolutions which  quest for God, revolutions which quest for Islam, revolutions  which can make themselves heard throughout the world and declare  their demands, saying: we do not want territory, we do not want  water, we do not want money or power; we want justice and  fairness. Revolutions must come into existence on the basis of  right and justice. And they must break bullying powers, stand  up to them, and make their own aims and ideals known to the  world. They must lay the groundwork. These are the voluntary  parts. These are the parts which impose duties. These are the  parts which mean one must discard the mistaken idea that one  should sit about until the hidden imam comes and sorts things  out. No! The groundwork must be laid before his holiness  reappears. [passage omitted]</p>

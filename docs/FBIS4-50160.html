			<p>BFN     [Text] Zhengzhou, May 14 (XINHUA) -- The inauguration  ceremony for a memorial hall to Jiao Yulu and the unveiling of a  bronze statue to him were held today in Lankao City, in central  China's Henan Province.    Jiao Yulu, who died 30 years ago, was the secretary of the  party committee of Lankao County in the early 1960s. He  dedicated himself to the improvement of the local people's lives  and production. His deeds are regarded as fine examples for  county officials and officials across China at large to follow.    Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Central Committee of  the Communist Party of China (CPC), inscribed the nameplate for  the memorial hall.    Hu Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the Political  Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, cut the ribbon for the  opening of the hall.    He also unveiled Jiao's statue, which is 1.5 m in height and  1.2 m in width.    In the hall are displayed scrolls with inscriptions by party  and state leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan and  Liu Huaqing.    Jiang Zemin's inscription reads: "learn from comrade Jiao  Yulu and serve the people with heart and soul".    Premier Li Peng's inscription reads: "uphold and carry  forward Jiao Yulu's spirit".    After the ceremony Hu and his party went to Jiao's tomb to  pay tributes. He laid a wreath there on behalf of the CPC  Central Committee.    Beside the tomb he met Jiao's wife, Xu Junya, and Jiao's  children and grandchildren.    Li Changchun, secretary of the Henan Provincial Party  Committee, and other leading officials from central and local  departments attended the ceremony.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The United States has erected many non-tariff  barriers on its imports although it has put pressure on foreign  nations to rectify their unfair practices, the Korea Trade  Promotion Corporation (KOTRA) said, quoting a report of a U.S.  civilian body.    In a report on U.S. unfair trade practices, the Citizens for  a Sound Economy Foundation said that there are many unfair  practices in the United States and certain barriers are higher  than those in foreign countries.    The report pointed out that the United States has set up  complicated guidelines on automobile fuel efficiency which have  become non-tariff import barriers on European deluxe cars.    The body claimed that the United States has limited imports  of dairy products to 2 percent of total U.S. production and  tariffs are high at 10-20 percent although it puts pressure on  foreign countries to open their farm markets.    It also pinpointed non-tariff barriers in services, claiming  that foreigners are strictly banned from engaging in TV and  radio broadcasting business in the United States although U.S.  operators have pressurized foreign governments to open their  markets.    In the public construction works, foreigners are obligated  to  use U.S. made construction equipment and material under the Buy  American Act.    The body pointed out that the Bill Clinton administration  plans to increase subsidies to industries and agriculture  despite Uruguay Round accord on reduction of subsidies.</p>

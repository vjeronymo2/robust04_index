			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The U.S. Government May Report About Paraguay, </F> But..."]    [Text] The periodic U.S. State Department human rights  reports on Paraguay are part of an analysis of the situation in  all of Latin America. Only First World countries are exempt  from this report because the United States surely lacks moral  authority and reasons to pass judgment on them.    Undoubtedly, no one feels comfortable with such reports;  they  constitute U.S. Government interference in the domestic affairs  of sovereign countries. Moreover, their use is not always  restricted to moral sanctions. Sometimes they become the basis  for economic restrictions and other kinds of pressures that  indirectly undermine universal principles of noninterference.  In sum, they are detestable documents.    Unfortunately, however, these reports have been shown to be  effective against the evils they attack. In Paraguay's case, it  must be noted that, more than any other, these reports helped  weaken the image of Alfredo Stroessner's dictatorship. It is  also worthwhile to mention that when the U.S. State Department  reports exposed to the world the infamous human rights situation  under the repression we were subjected to, the tyrant was forced  to yield while defense mechanisms against him were strengthened.  At the time, we appreciated these reports, and in an indirect  manner, we even helped draft them by supplying reliable  information. Consequently, for ethical reasons it is impossible  for us to reject the U.S. Government practice of issuing reports  on Paraguay's domestic situation.    Moreover, it must be stressed that these reports were never  biased regarding Paraguay's situation. They are limited to  revealing the information obtained from reliable sources. The  only objection to the latest report that was issued is that  although the human rights violation cases mentioned are possibly  all true and the comments on the justice system's faults are  true, the overall human rights situation in Paraguay is far from  being what it was more than five years ago.    To be coherent with the aforementioned reasons, we must  accept the criticisms and charges made in these foreign reports.  For our international image, however, it would be useful if  these reports made comparisons showing a foreign reader how much  progress Paraguay has achieved in this regard, and that our  political regime is much closer to the ideals of civilization  than during the dictatorship we were able to defeat.    In its next report, the U.S. State Department should be  careful to continue noting the errors that have been made and  the faults affecting our institutions because, although it may  annoy us, it compels us to correct them. But it also would be  encouraging for these reports to point out the progress that has  been achieved since the enforcement of the libertarian process.  This would give a real picture of the situation and reduce the  risks of hurting any feelings.</p>

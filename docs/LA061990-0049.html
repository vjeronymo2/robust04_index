			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> STORES MAY DEMAND PRINTS ON CHECKS  </P> <P> A quickly scrawled signature and flash of a driver's license may no longer be  enough to cash a check in Oxnard. Beginning in August, some Oxnard  check-cashing outlets and retail stores will begin demanding thumbprints on the  front of checks.  </P> <P> The fraud/forgery unit of the Oxnard Police Department hopes that the city's  most vulnerable merchants will sign up with Operation Chek-Print, a new program  to prevent forged, stolen and counterfeit checks.  </P> <P> Using new stain-free ink pads, police are targeting check-cashing companies,  small liquor stores and family-owned markets -- those most susceptible to  fraudulent checks, said Detective Peter Nicolle of the fraud/forgery unit.  </P> <P> "It's generally at the retail level that we're aiming this," Nicolle said.  "Crooks will get out of the business of being forgers in Oxnard."  </P> <P> Oxnard is the latest city to begin using a new technology to capture  thumbprints without offending customers with stained thumbs and discolored  clothing. The chemical dye used in the special ink pads reacts only with paper,  leaving no trace on human skin.  </P> <P> "You're not making a mess," said Steve Gordon, vice president of Signature  Security of Omaha, which began making the dye about two years ago.  </P> <P> Oxnard police said they will be able to match suspect thumbprints with those  gathered by CAL-ID, a statewide computer program that holds the prints of most  adults arrested since 1970.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] In Rwanda the rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic  Front [RPF] today took control first of the airport in Kigali  and then of the Kanombe barracks, where the government army was  holed up. [passage omitted]    Our correspondent Nicolas Poincare has been accompanying the  RPF troops for several days as they advance on Kigali. He sends  his first report this evening on the particularly tragic  situation in Rwanda:    [Poincare] [passage omitted] The RPF, scenting victory, will  not hear of a cease-fire, nor of the arrival of fresh UN troops.  Dr Emile Roua Massirabo, deputy chairman of the RPF, explains  that the arrival of UN troops would mean the preservation of the  status quo, and hence continuing massacres in the areas held by  the regular army. He said so yesterday in his headquarters in  Kibungo:    [Begin Massirabo recording] When they ask for such an  intervention force, we have the feeling that on the one hand,  they are telling us to stop pursuing the killers, and on the  other, they (?will not) be able to stop the massacres, and they  will be given a free hand to continue their vile work. [end  recording]    [Poincare] The UN troops can only look on impotently at this  success. They cannot even use the airport any more. Nicolas  Poincare, France Inter, Kibungo, Rwanda.</p>

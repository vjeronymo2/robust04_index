			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / International Company News: DM600m operating loss at Lufthansa LUFTHANSA, the German national airline, made an operating loss of DM600m (Dollars 375m) in the first five months of this year and is talking with trade unions about increases in working hours and delays in pay increases. 'We have to move a big mountain,' said Hans-Helmut Ebersbach, personnel director, about the need to reduce labour costs. Because of higher living expenses, pay reductions were out of the question. 'So we have to be more efficient with fewer employees at the same income levels,' he said in an internal publication. The airline, in which just over half the shares are owned by the state, incurred a pre-tax loss of DM386m during the first quarter of 1992. It said yesterday that it did not expect to end this year in the black. The public sector workers' strike in May, which led to airport disruptions, cost the group a further DM60m in lost profits. Under its new chief executive, Jurgen Weber, Lufthansa has emphasised the need to lift productivity and reduce costs at a time of intense competition. Like other airlines, it has suffered from price competition across the Atlantic and wants agreement with a US airline to increase its penetration of North America. Mr Weber has also inveighed against what he regards as the restrictive attitude of the US government towards allowing greater access to European airlines. Last year, Lufthansa made a loss of DM301m before tax against a profit in 1990 of DM142m.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Tehran IRIB Television Second Program  Network in Persian at 1441 GMT on 8 April carries the second  Friday prayer from Qom by Ayatollah Haj Ebrahim Amini, lecturer  at theological school and member of the Assembly of Experts. The  sermon lasts 17 minutes.    In the second sermon he speaks, in part, about the severing  of relations with the United States in 1980, which he says is  now Muslim's number one enemy, and that Tehran will not  reestablish relations with Washington.    He says: "One of the great events of the week is the 1980  severing of relations with the United States. This severing of  relations is a source of pride for Islamic Iran. Islamic Iran  is proud to have such independence of spirit as to be able to  put the United States aside. It is very happy about this and it  is not prepared to return to American servitude. Although U.S.  officials sometimes show courtesy here and there, such  courtesies are to no avail as long as the United States does not  end its wicked ways in the world [crowd noise] and as long as it  does not end its enmity with Islam. The United States has  really become the biggest enemy of Islam today. Those  courtesies will bear no fruit and as long as the United States  is a world Satan, Iranian people are determined not to establish  any relations with it."</p>

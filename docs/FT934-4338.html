			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / In peace as in war Israel outplays the Arabs: As Arafat's supporters lose confidence, Rabin has the upper hand Middle East peace talks at an impasse, violence in the occupied territories, Jewish settlers on the rampage, and Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, damping hopes for his visit to the region which began last night. It all strikes a depressingly familiar note, coming so soon after the euphoria created by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation when they signed their declaration of principles in Washington on September 13. But although the danger is growing that the two sides will fail to meet their first deadline, a week on Monday, for implementing the initial stage of the outline peace accord, the appearances are probably worse than the reality. By December 13, Israel and the PLO are supposed to have agreed a range of issues which would permit the start of an Israeli troop withdrawal from much of the Gaza Strip and an area around the West Bank town of Jericho. 'It is a sacred date. They must respect it, or the whole peace process will be affected,' Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, said in Copenhagen this week. From his headquarters in Tunis came the warning that negotiations over the extent of the Israel withdrawal had reached an impasse, and US help was needed to rescue the process. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, appears less concerned, probably because he understands Mr Arafat's negotiating techniques and realises how little room the PLO leader has for manoeuvre. In London on Thursday, Mr Rabin said he would like to meet the deadline, but preferred to let it slip by a few weeks if that meant they would achieve a precisely defined deal. Israel, he said, would stick by its commitment to complete the first stage of withdrawal by the next target date of April 13. Time, however, has always been a luxury for peacemakers in the Middle East. Fifteen Israelis and 31 Palestinians have died violently since Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat shook hands on the south lawn of the White House, and many more have been wounded. Opponents of the agreement will be encouraged by the latest difficulties, and suspicions among Palestinians in the territories about Israel's true intentions are bound to increase if the troop withdrawal does not begin on schedule. The danger was clear from the outset. Mr Arafat and Mr Rabin both gambled on being able to carry with them the biggest part of their domestic constituencies. The Israeli leader's calculations were the more finely honed. He wrong-footed his right-wing opponents, achieved swift parliamentary endorsement for his actions, and retains public credibility for his determination to stand firm on security issues. Even so, the latest poll in Israel shows support for the peace process down to 43 per cent, a fall of over 20 per cent since September, and opposition rising at 47 per cent. Mr Arafat was meanwhile busy embellishing his already well-practised impersonation of Houdini by not only escaping from the consultative chains with which fellow Palestinians sought to bind him, but also simultaneously ignoring the agreement with the Syrians, Jordanians and Lebanese that no one Arab partner would do a separate deal with the Israelis. For several months before September 13, Palestinian discontent with Mr Arafat had been approaching a crescendo, not least among those representing the PLO at the Washington negotiations. Resignations were in the air and the accusations were myriad. Mr Arafat was said, not for the first time, to be alternately autocratic and indecisive, and unwilling to consult with any but his closest colleagues. He stood accused of bringing the PLO to the verge of financial ruin, and of coming close to wrecking the entire organisation. Those accusations are still rife today. But just as his leadership looked to be tottering, he made his dramatic deal with Israel, appeared in Washington, was praised by President Clinton, welcomed on Capitol Hill, and promised Palestinians a future state with Arab east Jerusalem as its eternal capital. It was gripping theatre, but the plot had only a beginning, followed by an ill-defined series of subsequent acts, and an ending on which the authors, not to mention the other actors, profoundly disagreed. Getting from the starting point to the conclusion of an interim five-year period of Palestinian self-rule, during which the final status of the territories would be agreed, was always going to be a Herculean task. Mr Yossi Beilin, Israel's deputy foreign minister and a central figure in the process, speculated last month that it might have been easier to have started with an agreement on how the drama would end, and then work backwards to the White House lawn. There is weight to his argument, more so from the Palestinian perspective. Rifts within the wider Palestinian community have been widened by the long wait for tangible results of the peace accord to be seen in the territories, and by the still uncertain conclusion of the process. While the peripatetic Mr Arafat continues to be feted in world capitals (yesterday it was Gabon), the skilled negotiators needed to do the difficult, detailed work have tended to be ill-prepared and poorly briefed. The assumption of PLO headquarters in Tunis that it knows best is causing increasing resentment among those in the territories whose leadership role grew during the five-year uprising against Israeli occupation. Those concerns have been exacerbated by fears Israel is seeking to dominate the economic future of the Palestinians. In the short term there is resentment at Israel's efforts to play a key role in the disbursement of the Dollars 2bn in aid pledged by the international community towards rebuilding the infrastructure of the occupied territories, and in the longer term by its statements on the inevitability of a dependent Palestinian role. Palestinian commentators, an increasing number of whom have turned against Mr Arafat, delight in mocking his dilemma. 'Can a warrior negotiate as he surrenders?' wrote one this week, suggesting that Mr Arafat can only meet the December 13 deadline by giving way to Israeli demands. Mr Rabin has to decide in the next few days how much of a lifeline, if any, he needs to throw Mr Arafat to prevent a further erosion of Palestinian and, ultimately, Israeli support for their joint initiative.</p>

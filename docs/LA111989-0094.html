			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NEW DIRECTOR OF HOUSING COUNCIL TO DRAW ON PAST;  </P> <P> DISCRIMINATION FIGHTER: FORMER URBAN LEAGUE EXECUTIVE MARY MILLER IS THE FOURTH  HEAD OF THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY FAIR HOUSING COUNCIL IN THREE YEARS.  </P> <P> The scrutiny Mary Miller endured 10 years ago as the first black person to move  into a Los Feliz condominium building was disquieting. It seemed to her that  every move she made, every word she spoke, was examined by residents made  uneasy by her presence.  </P> <P> Today, she said, her neighbors acknowledge their past wariness. But Miller, the  fourth executive director of the San Fernando Valley Fair Housing Council in  three years, said they now value her as a neighbor. She said that turnaround --  from reluctance to acceptance -- is what comes of challenging preconceptions.  </P> <P> The other residents of her complex "didn't escape from the building . . . and  sell their condos," said Miller, 61, who assumed her new position two weeks  ago.  </P> <P> "Once they are in close proximity to . . . people other than their own ethnic  group, they say, 'Hey, that wasn't so bad,' " said Miller, who worked for the  Los Angeles regional office of the Urban League, the influential civil rights  organization, for 23 years.  </P> <P> Miller said she expects to draw on that experience as head of the troubled  nonprofit fair housing council, which uses government grants to uncover and  battle housing discrimination against minorities as well as families with young  children.  </P> <P> She was the only candidate seriously considered during a six-month search by  the council board of directors. Dozens of others who applied for the job, which  pays between $27,000 and $33,000, lacked the proper credentials, board members  said.  </P> <P> Miller's move to the Los Feliz condominium was not the first time she had been  a pioneer. Her family was one of the first black families to live in the nearly  all-white northern Chicago suburb of Glencoe. She was the first black woman to  attend the National College of Education in Evanston, Ill.  </P> <P> Her professional experience and education will serve her well. As the assistant  director of the Los Angeles regional office of the Urban League, she was  responsible for education, training and management development for local  affiliates of the organization. She holds a master's degree in management from  the University of Redlands.  </P> <P> Enthusiastic board members, who voted unanimously to hire her, say they are  confident that she will end a turbulent period in the council's 30-year  history.  </P> <P> The council fired its last executive director, who had been in the job seven  months, for incompetence last March. The Fair Housing Congress of Southern  California, the umbrella organization that distributes city and county grants  to the six housing councils in Los Angeles County, put the council on probation  in August, 1988, when the council fired its previous executive director.  </P> <P> That director was fired after only five months on the job for making an  allegedly anti-Semitic remark. The fair housing congress became worried that  the rapid turnover was causing a drop-off in housing discrimination  investigations. Before that, the job had been vacant nine months after the  departure of a director who had held the job less than a year.  </P> <P> The congress was concerned about overly ambitious fund-raising goals and rumors  of a power struggle on the council's board of directors.  </P> <P> Marcella Brown, executive director of the congress, said the Valley council  will remain on probation indefinitely. Brown said she was encouraged by  Miller's extensive background.  </P> <P> Said Holly Azzari, president of the Valley council's board of directors, "She  has everything we wanted and more." Azzari said Miller's long involvement in  civil rights issues, extensive experience as a fund-raiser, budget expertise  and management background make her highly qualified for the position.  </P> <P> Rafer Johnson, the well-known Olympic athlete who was on the search committee  for the executive director's position, said the council's previous directors  lacked the necessary qualifications.  </P> <P> "What has happened in the past was . . . we hired some people that just  couldn't do the job," Johnson said. "The fair housing history in the San  Fernando Valley has been exemplary, and we haven't had it in our executive  directors in recent years to continue that excellence. I think we have found it  in Mary Miller."  </P> <P> Miller said she knows about the council's problems but is optimistic about its  future. "I'm going to approach this . . . in a positive vein because there is  so much work that has to be done," she said.  </P></p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Government Bonds: Heavy selling after German rate comments European government bonds fell sharply on wire reports of comments made by Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer, which were taken to mean that there would be no more official German interest rate cuts in the near future. Although most continental European markets were closed for Whit Monday, London-traded futures contracts fell steeply - albeit on thin volume. Weaker US Treasuries put a further damper on European bond markets. According to one news agency, Tietmeyer told a press conference in Helsinki that 'we are not following a step-by-step cut in interest rates for the time being'. He was also reported as saying that signs are increasing that the western German recession has come to an end and the economic recovery has begun. This triggered heavy London selling across the German yield curve. At the short end, the March three-money interest rate future slid by 0.30 point to 94.51, implying three-month rates of 5.49 per cent by mid-March, well above the current 5.13 per cent three-month D-Mark deposit rate. At the long end, the June Bund future fell by 0.96 point to 94.50. 'The short end has overreacted,' said Mr John Hall, European economist at Swiss Bank Corp. 'Even if official rates are not cut soon, this still leaves room for the repo rate to fall.' That currently stands at 5.23 per cent, still well above the 4.5 per cent discount rate which acts as a floor to money market rates. He still expects another discount rate cut, but even if that does not happen, the Bundesbank 'can still lower the repo rate to around 4.75 per cent' before the end of the cycle. All eyes are now on tomorrow's repo allocation. 'People will watch it for an indication of where German monetary policy is going,' said Mr Torsten Bohler, bond analyst at UBS. A small cut could reinforce fears that the easing cycle is coming to an end, he said. Bad M3 money supply numbers could prompt further selling, he said. Although a figure close to last month's 15.4 per cent rate appears to be discounted, it could reinforce the market's negative sentiment, traders said. Europe's few other active markets also took a blow from the German sell-off. UK government bonds fell sharply, also depressed by concern over the inflationary impact of rising commodity prices. In late trading, the UK long gilt future was down almost one point at 105 3/16 . Analysts said the most important event for gilts this week is likely to be Wednesday's auction by the Bank of England of the new convertible gilt. They said interest for the new bond was growing as investors begin to take up more of a defensive position after the recent rally in gilts, which was particularly marked at the long end, by switching from longer to shorter-dated bonds. Italian bonds posted particularly large losses, with the June bond future on Liffe falling by 1.40 point to 111.22. Spanish bonds outperformed them significantly, with the June contract shedding only 0.64 point on the day to close at 96.77. US Treasury bonds broke into a retreat yesterday as commodity prices showed their sharpest one-day gain in nearly a year and the dollar lost more ground against the D-Mark. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 1 3/8 lower at 85 29/32 , with the yield rising to 7.432 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down  9/32 to 99 1/4 , to yield 5.896 per cent. As the afternoon progressed, traders became unnerved by the steady rise in the Commodity Research Bureau's index. Near the end of the day, the closely-watched measure of inflation was up 4.49 at 238.18, its biggest rise since last July. A second disturbing development was the erosion of the value of the dollar against the D-Mark, following comments by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, suggesting the German recession had ended. With no fresh US economic news released, the market was also looking ahead to the Treasury's sale of Dollars 17bn in new two-year notes this afternoon, followed by the issuance of Dollars 11bn in five-year securities tomorrow. The last auctions of short-term paper had generated disappointing demand, and many traders were seeking to protect themselves against the possibility that the market would not be able to absorb the new supply.</p>

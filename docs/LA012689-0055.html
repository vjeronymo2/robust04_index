			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR COLLECTIBLES: WATCH OUT FOR FAKES WHEN BUYING FOBS  </P> <P> Question: My grandfather left me an old watch fob that has a company trademark  on the back. I believe its origins put its age at almost 100 years. Can you  give me some idea when fobs of this type were popular? -- W.R.  </P> <P> Answer: The heyday for fobs was during the late part of the 19th Century. And,  according to collectors, the fact that your fob has a company marking on it is  a strong indication that it is a genuine collectible and not a fake processed  to look "old."  </P> <P> Fobs became a popular vehicle for union and advertising messages; as a result,  they can command hefty prices from collectors specializing in a particular time  period or accumulating fobs identified with a specific company.  </P> <P> Most 19th-Century fobs were made of metal, although some hard-to-find enamel  fobs have survived.  </P> <P> Prices can range from a few dollars to $100 or more. So, obviously, the  would-be collector should take time to find out whether the fob is a genuine  collectible or is a recently produced fake.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lists  </P> <P> Reader interest has been expressed in the compilation of a list of individuals  or companies producing mail-order auction catalogues.  </P> <P> We'll start with a few mail auction operations that deal in a diverse  assortment of collectibles -- ranging from military to political to  film-related items.  </P> <P> Naturally, we're not going to cover all of the bases in this first attempt; but  we'll add to it in the coming months.

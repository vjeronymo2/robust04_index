			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTES;  </P> <P> 53 MARLIN LANDED IN CONTEST  </P> <P> Plying the waters off Cabo San Lucas last week were 109 sportfishing boats,  each carrying anglers who were hoping to catch the largest black or blue marlin  they could find.  </P> <P> They came from around this country and Canada to participate in Bisbee's ninth  annual Black and Blue Marlin tournament, which has developed into one of the  biggest spectacles on the southern Baja Peninsula.  </P> <P> The townspeople were there in force, more than 400 gathering on the beach each  day, according to Wayne Bisbee of Bisbee's Sportfishing Headquarters on Balboa  Island.  </P> <P> Francois Chevrier of Laguna Niguel set the pace on the first day when he landed  a 465-pound blue marlin, which would end up the event's biggest fish.  </P> <P> Chevrier's fishing partner, Loren Deniger, made it tougher on the competition  when he caught a 345-pounder to seal first place -- and a prize of $79,950 --  for the four aboard the Dorado III in the team category. David Ordway took  individual honors with two blue marlin totaling 480 pounds.  </P> <P> By the time the three-day tournament ended Saturday, 52 blue marlin and one  black marlin had been brought to the scales. Since the rules stated that anyone  keeping fish under 200 pounds would be penalized, more than 70 marlin were  released, Bisbee said.  </P> <P> More than $20,000 was raised for Camino del Estrella elementary school.  </P> <P> "All the fish except two, I think, went to the orphanages and retirement  homes," Bisbee said. "The Department of Welfare was there and was trucking the  fish away as fast as we could bring them up the beach."  </P> <P> Said Darrell Primrose of Tortuga Sportfishing: "It's the biggest deal of the  year. The mayor and everybody comes down."  </P> <P> Blue marlin remain active, and wahoo are starting to appear more frequently off  Cabo San Lucas, but the 90-degree water temperature appears to have slowed the  striped marlin bite, according to Primrose. The most productive area has been  the Gordo Banks, where yellowfin tuna and dorado are also being caught.  </P> <P> Farther north, in the East Cape region of the Baja Peninsula, the marlin bite  is being described as "slower than normal" because of an abundance of giant  squid, many weighing more than 30 pounds.  </P> <P> The squid have been hitting iron lures, however, and have made for an  interesting change of pace.  </P> <P> One blue marlin that apparently hadn't had its fill of squid hit two trolled  marlin lures over the weekend and was fought by La Mirada's Fred Cotrell and  Don Robertson, who after 1 1/4 hours landed a 561-pounder.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, dorado fishing doesn't seem to be affected by the squid, and  Castaneda said light-tackle fishermen "are catching all the dorado they want."  Most boats are averaging about eight a day, between 15 and 45 pounds.  </P> <P> Briefly  </P> <P> Bald Eagle tours narrated by naturalist Neal Taylor begin Saturday at Santa  Barbara County's Lake Cachuma. Reservations: (805) 568-2460. . . .California's  fall turkey-hunting season opens Nov. 11 in all but San Diego County.

There is  concern that historical winter runs of more than 100,000 spawning salmon to the  upper Sacramento dwindled to a record low of fewer than 600 fish this year.  </P> <P> The Lives of Ducks and Geese will be the subject of the Department of Fish and  Game's weekly 9 a.m. tour of the Upper Newport Bay Ecological Reserve in  Newport Beach.

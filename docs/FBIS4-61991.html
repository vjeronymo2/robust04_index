			<p>BFN     [Text] The Georgian and Abkhazian delegations to the  settlement talks held in Moscow today signed a document on  setting up a joint coordinating commission responsible for  issues of mutual interest in power engineering, transportation,  communications, environmental protection, etc. This statement  was made by a member of the Abkhazian delegation, representative  of Abkhazia in Moscow Igor Akhba, in an interview with INTERFAX  Wednesday [11 May].    Akhba said the commission which would be composed of four  members from each side will start its work in Sochi on 1 June.    Akhba said he was confident the talks would produce an  agreement to establish a cease-fire and troop separation on 12  May. The final variant of the agreement had already been  prepared, he said. The document provides for the deployment of  peacekeeping forces along the river Inguri, the line of  confrontation between Georgian and Abkhazian troops. Before the  deployment, the two sides are to separate their troops each by  12 km from the river.    According to Akhba, it was decided that the CIS peacekeeping  forces would be deployed in the area. "It is more likely that it  will be a Russian contingent," he said. U.N. officials will  act as observers.    Akhba pointed out that the decision to deploy CIS  peacekeepers in Abkhazia should be taken by CIS states in  response to an appeal by the participants of the talks. If the  agreement is signed, such an appeal may be sent as early as  Thursday. Akhba did not preclude that in this case the decision  to deploy the peacekeepers in the conflict area might be made  within the next five days.</p>

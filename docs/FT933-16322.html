			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Scarman calls for inquiry LORD SCARMAN, the former law lord, yesterday called for an independent inquiry into the Nadir affair as a fresh row surfaced over allegations of a Pounds 3.5m conspiracy to bribe the Old Bailey judge handling Mr Nadir's fraud trial. Lord Scarman said: 'Nothing that has been revealed so far gives any guidance to the truth. The only thing that has emerged is the necessity for a public inquiry. The matters which have been raised are much too serious.' A majority of MPs share the government's view that parliament should not interfere in the running of criminal justice. However, responding to the attorney-general's public refusal last week to order an inquiry, Lord Scarman said the government had yet to produce 'irresistible answers to a number of questions', including questions about the conduct of the inquiry by the Serious Fraud Office and the allegations concerning Mr Nadir himself. 'Unless the government comes forward with an an absolutely transparent reason why the matter should be taken no further . . . the public should know the truth,' he said. Mr Nadir yesterday renewed his public onslaught against the SFO and the police, accusing them of conducting a campaign of 'disinformation' designed to discredit him. In a statement issued to the Press Association from northern Cyprus, where he is a fugitive from British justice, Mr Nadir said: 'At no time whatsoever have I been involved in a plot to bribe Mr Justice Tucker.' His solicitors, Pannone and Partners of Manchester, broke with the normal legal practice of not commenting publicly on a criminal case subject to trial, claiming that the latest bribery allegations 'hit directly at the criminal judicial system'. They added: 'Media speculation should not be allowed to continue. The government should immediately set up an independent judicial inquiry to establish the true facts.' The Sunday Times yesterday reported on the alleged plot to bribe Judge Tucker, based on what the newspaper called 'confidential transcripts of Nadir's pre-trial hearings earlier this year; a Serious Fraud Office legal document; and notes of an interview between Nadir and Scotland Yard officers'. Lord Scarman argued that while an inquiry might prejudice Mr Nadir's trial, it might still be considered 'to be in the overriding public interest to hold one'. The former chairman of Nissan UK, Mr Octav Botnar, yesterday pledged to return to the UK to face trial over allegations of tax fraud 'as soon as I can'. Mr Botnar, recovering from cancer at his home in Lausanne, Switzerland, told BBC TV's Breakfast with Frost programme: 'If I would not do it, I would lose my self-respect.' He insisted he was innocent and also claimed he had donated only Pounds 90,000 to the Tories, not Pounds 1m as some newspapers have claimed.</p>

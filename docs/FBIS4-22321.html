			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Shchekochikhin, member of the Public </F> Chamber under the Russian Federation President, by DELOVOY MIR  columnist Valentin Khalin: "`I See Russia Without Poor People in  Place of a Country Without Rich People'"]    [Text] Some 60 lines of text would be needed to list  all of Viktor Shchekochikhin's titles: member of the Public  Chamber under the Russian Federation President, owner of  farmsteads and the "Zemlyane" Association, president of the  Russian Union of Private Proprietors--he performs these and many  other roles... DELOVOY MIR columnist Valentin Khalin talks with  him.    I did not ask him how he has the time to cope with his  roles.  I did not ask because at the very beginning Viktor Vladimirovich  noted casually: "I work 12 to 14 hours a day." A person of  bubbling energy, he literally compresses time even further in  the process. We met together on a Sunday and spent about 4  hours, including a trip to the VDNKh (VVTs) [Exhibition of  Achievements of the National Economy], where we viewed the  farmstead exhibit, ate a quick cold lunch--bread, sausage, and  coffee.    Though most of the business people I have had occasion to  meet have roughly the same mentality and do not take the trouble  to separate day from night. I was struck by something else. We  had arranged to discuss problems in the development of free  enterprise, but my interlocutor began speaking about... space.    "A national strategic objective can help Russia out of the  chaos into which it has been plunged," he said. "Let us recall  how the instigators of World War II were revitalized after the  war. Germany counted on foreign loans and advanced  technologies, Italy did practically the same thing, and Japan  went into the fields of electronics and automotive  manufacturing. The USSR lost "the cold war" and collapsed. For  the world of today, this geopolitical cataclysm is like the fall  of the Roman Empire was for the ancient world. Then the people  were plunged into the dismal Middle Ages for a long time. But  today, Russia has retained a powerful reserve for a rapid  revival. It has been and remains a great space power. And this  invaluable potential must be utilized for all it is worth, as  they say. Because it is the way to the future. Sooner or later  harmful products and radioactive waste will be carried outside  the limits of the atmosphere and energy will have to be obtained  from new sources in the space near earth. Is it a coincidence  that not only the United States, Russia, and the European  countries, but China, India, and Japan have turned their  attention to space? In this rush by all of mankind, Russia is  among the first, and it has produced a valuable commodity. So  why shouldn't we take advantage of it? We can and must receive  sizable investments to go into space. Then the most advanced  technologies will be required, the flywheel of the former VPK  [military industrial complex] will begin rotating in the  direction needed, plans will be revitalized, young persons will  once again exert themselves in fiztekh, the Bauman, and the MGU  [physicotechnical and Bauman educational institutions and the  Moscow State University], and the brain drain will cease.    "Back in July 1988, some persons who shared my ideas and I  formed the `Zemlyane' Business Cooperation Association, whose  members are associations with a nonstate form of ownership. The  economic development of space is a priority for us. We are  looking for promising aerospace projects for capital investment.  Twice a year--in April and October--we hold international  conferences in which scientists take part and we publish  collections of materials. These are still just the first steps,  of course. Many generations of our descendants will be faced  with tasks that are colossal in scope. But this is an objective,  tangible strategic purpose, clear and attractive to each and  every person, not some kind of mythical communism and sausage  for everyone. Although you will see the people rallying together  in the right way on the way into space, loving each other, and  providing themselves with their daily bread in a friendly  manner."    [Khalin] You speak about private capital investment in space  programs, Viktor Vladimirovich. But what about state and other  forms of ownership? Is there really no place for them under the  sun?    [Shchekochikhin] Of course, why not? But they are very  sluggish. The past 70 years of our history have clearly  demonstrated that you will not overtake civilization by the  roadside. There is no reason to invent the bicycle. I am  convinced that the future lies with private ownership. What is  good about 30 members of a cooperative, for example, arguing  until they are hoarse and laboring in vain to determine the best  way for them to enter the market? But a competent decision will  have to be made in a short amount of time concerning the  investment or transfer of capital, let us say. So it turns out  that the private entrepreneur is always ahead, and pays his  employees--and pays them well!--for a business gain instead of a  dispute about words. I was trained as an accountant and I worked  as an auditor in different sectors. I often traveled throughout  the former Soviet Union and realized long ago that only personal  interest within a legal framework is capable of moving the  economy, science, and culture ahead on progressive paths. My  path in business began when I opened one of Moscow's first  consultation bureaus in the field of economic law and finance.  Two weeks after the law on cooperatives was approved I  registered a cooperative--actually with the functions of a bank,  which began providing insurance, clearing and credit, and  financial services. I opened training classes for accountants  and cooperative chairmen. When I began accumulating capital, I  saw for myself that it is impossible to realize economic plans  outside of the market infrastructure, without reliable partners,  a strong legal foundation, and a calm if not respectful attitude  toward free enterprise and private property in the mass  consciousness. I do not intend to take capital abroad; on the  contrary, I am actively trying to create an environment as  favorable as possible for free enterprise, for foreign  investments in domestic programs, and for the enlightenment of  minds. I am attending the Diplomatic Academy myself, gnawing on  the granite of post-Marxist science about the society we were  guarded against for decades, and it has moved farther and  farther ahead. Now this is what I have come up with. I think I  have been on the right path. The letters also convince me of  this. Once I received a letter from 15-year-olds in the Far  East: teach us the right way to make money competently, they  said, so that we can become rich people and compete with the  Americans. I received a similar request from mature persons in  Western Ukraine who wondered why they spent the best years of  their lives working hard on the century's construction projects.  They think they have enough strength to scrape together some  capital over the next 10 years or so and pass it on to their  grandchildren to give them starting opportunities.    Do you sense the mood? People are fed up with living in a  country without rich people. And I agree with them. I want to  see Russia without poor people. I am sometimnes called a private  property fanatic. This is not the case at all. State  enterprises, sovkhozes, or kolkhozes do not have to be broken  up. Under conditions of market relationships, private capital  should simply occupy its proper place in the economy. But for a  start, taking into account our traditions of leveling and  parasitism, it must be provided for, including through  legislation, by giving priority to opportunities for its  buildup. Only then will there be a truly competitive  environment--the ferment of a country's progressive development.  Only then will there be genuine democracy. The owner (it does  not matter what he owns--capital, a creative gift, or a  profession) is economically free. He will never be suited by a  ration, unlike those whose payment depends entirely on the  arbitrariness of the state and its officials. An energetic  person will always find an energetic employer. And they will not  be serving an abstract state interest, but shaping a state which  is capable of looking out for the interests of its  citizen-owners. In my view, this is what democracy is all about.    [Khalin] As I understand it, you are building a bridge from  the national idea of space development to the creation of a  state with a market economy and prosperous owners. How can this  be achieved and in what period of time, in your view?    [Shchekochikhin] Not in 30 or 40 years, as the skeptics are  promising, but much sooner. In order to consolidate market  relationships we need two things--private ownership and a  competitive environment. There is only one way to achieve  this--through parliament. As owners, we want and should be  represented in a legislative organ. We are prepared to join a  bloc with parties which really stand up for the rights of  entrepreneurs and common human values. I think we will find  understanding both in the State Duma and among the people, and  together we will work out and adopt a normative foundation for a  legal democratic state. The people are tired of the shocks and  the futile political brawling, and they yearn for clarity and  stability. I am convinced that the healthy, productive forces of  our society are capable of offering a clear-cut program to get  out of the crisis and awaken Russians' creative spirit. We were  not born yesterday! If other states have been able to raise  themselves from the ruins to the heights of prosperity, God  himself has told us to dare. Our resources--both natural and  human resources--are inexhaustible. We need only to get  organized, unfetter initiative, and move from populist games to  actual reform of the economy.    [Khalin] But what do you mean by "a clear-cut program?"    [Shchekochikhin] First of all, we need a package of laws on  private property: it is sacred and inviolable. Only then will it  be possible to stop official arbitrariness and all kinds of  social experiments--first given, then taken away, either  forgotten or lost. Separately, laws on the priority of domestic  private enterprise and the right to own, buy and sell land...    [Khalin] Excuse me, but the mass media from government  circles are advertising the successes of privatization. At the  end of last year, the president's edict "On Regulating Land  Relationships and the Development of Agrarian Reform in Russia"  was published. Isn't this really a solution of the problem?    [Shchekochikhin] I will answer the question with another  question. Simply put, for ordinary people to understand. Vanya  is lying on a sofa with a share of stock in his pocket. He has  not tasted the competitive struggle, and he has not burned his  fingers in bankruptcy. He will be receiving dividends without  risking anything except his voucher. Well, what kind of owner is  he? As before, he is relying on the collective reasoning of some  other person. And that person is a member of the  nomenklatura--he has not raised a finger, either. Both of them  seem to be relying on each other, but both of them would not  object to cheating each other. Vanya has been working  listlessly, and he is counting on this in the future as well;  the bureaucrat could not care less--as before, he is closer to  the feeding trough. It does not smell of reform here, either.  There is still no owner of capital, no person with work  skills--no competition, no ownership, and hence, no market.    As far as the land edict is concerned, it does not have  direct action; it only declares private ownership of land and  contains references to the legislation in force, which does not  reflect the questions of buying and selling. In the meantime,  land is not being put into private ownership, but leased or  inherited for use during one's lifetime. It may be terminated  not with the death of an owner, but much sooner: under the new  edict the land becomes the object of auction bidding. The farmer  who has invested millions of rubles and years of work in his  plot risks being deprived of it right away. It may be taken away  by the heads of administrations under the pretext that it has  been utilized poorly. That is, a wide sluice has been opened for  official arbitrariness.    This is a deeply personal question for me: I invested a  great  deal of money in land. I have several thousand hectares in the  suburban Moscow area and near Ryazan. Last fall I harvested a  good barley crop. With what I received from its sale I bought  two tractors and two combines, thereby providing new equipment  for future agricultural operations. I recently acquired deserted  farms on a sovkhoz--I will be raising bulls. There is an  arrangement with a Spanish firm to form an SP [joint venture] to  process livestock products.    [Khalin] Do you consider yourself a rich man?    [Shchekochikhin] There are different kinds of wealth. I want  to enjoy all the advantages of land, of course. But for me this  is not an end in itself. I do not store up money in a box or go  on a spree. I am fascinated by the process of enterprise itself,  and I want my money to work for me. Those who formerly were  engaged in illegal economic activity, those who grabbed state  property in the course of privatization, and those who receive  superprofits without any preparation boast about their wealth.  These people have not smelled the market or earned every kopeck  through bitter experience. They obtained their wealth easily and  they lose it easily--on binges, possessions, and in the casino.  They corrupt society and their environment, mistreat less  fortunate citizens, and disparage the importance of true  entrepreneurs, who are increasing capital not for the sake of  luxury, but by vocation as production organizers and those who  create what is new and advanced. There have been forerunners of  the latter in Russian history--Tretyakov, Mamontov, Morozov, and  Sytin.    Generally speaking, I distinguish between three varieties in  enterprise: the nomenklatura variety, that is, the enterprise  that is "seized for privatization," the state enterprise,  personified by the corps of directors; and finally, our private  enterprise, when a person has struggled through all the  obstacles with his own brain and has achieved his status by hard  work. To us, the first two groups exist as partners which have  to be forced out in the course of the competitive struggle.  There are few of us at present. As an example, the "Goryachev"  Concern in St. Petersburg, which manufactures and repairs  pianos. At Ramenskoye, in the suburbs of Moscow, the builder  Guskov is well-known... In a word, there are about 5,000 legal  entities in our union. In general, the entrepreneurial class in  every nation under market conditions makes up no more than 3 to  5 percent of the population. We are far removed from this  indicator, of course. But there is a time for everyone. And we  will reach our heights, too.    [Khalin] Well, all right, one way or another, but you are  wealthy and I am not. How does this correlate with your thesis  on a Russia without poor people?    [Shchekochikhin] The number of poor will be reduced in  proportion to the increase in the number of wealthy persons.  Well-to-do persons will need hundreds and thousands of skilled  workers, engineers, lawyers, and so forth, including artists and  journalists. Each one of them salaried in accordance with his  services. If you do not want to stand in need, demonstrate the  quality of your work. After all, everything is competitive here  as well. Perhaps to a certain extent it is accidental or good  luck. But this is life. This is what the West is based on. And  it does not seem to be especially poor. As far as the sick and  the aged are concerned, the state will take care of them if we  are meticulous about paying our taxes. And every state is rich  with the wealth of its citizens. The more wealthy people there  are, the wealthier the budget. Charity cannot be disregarded,  either.    [Khalin] So we are standing at the gates of paradise?    [Shchekochikhin] Paradise will never come if we wait  passively for manna from Heaven. If you want to live, know how  to spin around. This probably sounds a little crude, but it is  100-percent true about everything. We ourselves are the only  ones who will protect our interests.</p>

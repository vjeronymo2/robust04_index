			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses wary ahead of FOMC meeting Preoccupied with currency and interest rate considerations, bourses were not disposed to react to the mid-morning bounce on Wall Street, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT tried for another rise in the pre-bourse, where the Dax index hit a day's high of 2,068.36. However, professionals were conscious that it was only two weeks ago that the index was testing 1,950; and that there will be a number of events to test it over the next few days. The Dax subsided on the session to close 21.71 lower at 2,032.69, understandable, said Ms Barbara Altmann at B Metzler in Frankfurt, in view of the scope for profit-taking, the sense that a short consolidation would make, and the prospect of high level economic meetings: the FOMC, in Washington, yesterday afternoon and today; the Bundesbank, tomorrow; and G7, on Friday. In the post-bourse, the Ibis indicated Dax stood relatively still, although the September bund future fell by a full percentage point from its day's high of 92.42 before it recovered late to 91.60. Ms Altmann thought that the equity market had already discounted a rate rise in the US. Turnover rose from DM4.4bn to DM5.7bn. There was little acknowledgement of the Chinese high level mission to Germany, and the billion-D-Mark industrial contracts for German companies expected to result. Siemens, which rose DM7.50 on Monday, dropped DM9 to DM653.50, although it seemed likely to be the biggest single beneficiary. PARIS saw a hefty rebound in Alcatel Alsthom, although Mr Pierre Suard, its chairman, was placed under investigation formally just after midnight on Tuesday for corruption and misuse of public funds for work carried out at his home. Traders said the feared US sales of Alcatel shares had not materialised. The stock rose FFr31, or 5.7 per cent, to FFr572 in 1.27m shares traded, the heaviest volume of the day, as the CAC-40 index recovered 12.55 to 1,878.73. Overall, turnover was still thin at FFr2.89bn. Generale des Eaux, caught in the Alcatel backlash on Monday, recovered FFr16 to FFr531. Meanwhile, Schneider, the electrical group whose chairman was arrested in Belgium at the end of May, continued its slow return to engineering favour, rising FFr11.30 to FFr363.30 after a 1994 low towards the end of June. MILAN picked up amid renewed domestic demand for blue chip stocks, although many investors remained hesitant, awaiting the broad outline of government measures to cut the budget deficit which will be released tomorrow. The Comit index added 4.40 at 691.24, news of a pay deal affecting 1.7m metalworkers helping the mood. The agreement, which traditionally sets the trend for other sectors, provides for staggered wage rises over the next two years in line with expected inflation. Among the blue chips, Fiat rose L190, or 2.9 per cent, to L6,640, Olivetti put on L60, or 2.5 per cent, at L2,470 and Pirelli added L70 at L2,575. Ciga, the luxury hotels group in which ITT Sheraton, of the US, is expected to try to gain effective control, strengthened L20 to L1,125 ahead of today's shareholders meeting. ZURICH was unable to maintain Monday's momentum and the SMI index gave back 26.7 to 2,609 in thin volume, with the market taking its direction from easier bond futures. Roche certificates fell SFr85 to SFr6,330 and UBS bearers SFr8 to SFr1,169. Against the trend, Georg Fischer picked up SFr20 to SFr1,470, still benefiting from its chief financial officer's upbeat forecast of profits for this year. MADRID built on the uncertainties elsewhere, the general index falling 5.65, or 1.9 per cent, to 295.11 in Pta28bn turnover. Bankinter reversed a recently positive response to brokers' recommendations, leading banks down with a fall of Pta470, or 4.2 per cent, to Pta10,600. HELSINKI continued to show up well in spite of a 2.5 per cent drop in the Finnish banking and finance house index. The Hex index climbed 6.5 per cent to 1,704.8, driven up again by gains in Nokia, which capped a long period of outperformance; the electronics and industrial conglomerate closed another FM9 higher at FM460 after a FM24 gain on Monday, following its admission to quotation in the US. AMSTERDAM received a late fillip from Wall Street's early strength and the AEX index finished 1.70 higher at 389.70. KNP BT, the paper and packaging company, put on 20 cents at Fl 43.50 as it said it was studying various options to finance the growth of its office products group, including a US listing. Begemann, the troubled engineering group, dropped Fl 3, or 10 per cent, to Fl 29.50, a new low for the year, although analysts said they knew of no new development to account for the decline. TEL AVIV rebounded from Monday's low in heavy trading, the Mishtanim index rising 5.02, or 3.4 per cent, to 153.03 in turnover of Shk179m. Traders were unable to determine if this was a recovery, or simply a reaction after two weeks of heavy declines.

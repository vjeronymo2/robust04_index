			<p>BFN     [Text] The first and only technological promotion center  was dedicated today in Los Tinajones in Camaguey. For those  companies, organizations, or institutions that are interested in  promoting changes, in transforming the management of their  scientific activities in the quest for more efficient service,  the first technological promotion center was dedicated in  Camaguey.    This scientific and technical institution is headed by  experts, who since 1987 have been working in the management and  organization of the territory. They offer qualified and reliable  services. This is a center which groups a small team of  researchers and consultants, who must systematically work in the  companies promoting technological development and new  experience. It is a center that must fight to establish a style  of work which is totally new, a dynamic and agile style to solve  problems which are closely related to the companies' main  activities.    This center is based on a continuous exchange of  technologies  and experience with similar organizations, both in Cuba and  abroad. It has modern equipment for processing, storing, and  transmitting information. It will also work as a consulting firm  and a supplier of technological and commercial information, and  in personnel training programs.    In a first test program, it has offered services to several  companies, such as a cement factory, the Camaguey tourism  company, and the production scientific institute. The opening of  this technological promotion center will meet the basic demands  for organizational changes and will strengthen the institutions.</p>

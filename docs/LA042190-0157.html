			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ON THE WATERFRONT: WISE BOAT PURCHASE CAN HINGE ON A SURVEYOR  </P> <P> Whether you are thinking of spending $20,000 for a weekend trailer boat,  $100,000 for a family cruiser or a cool million for an oceangoing yacht, how do  you make sure the vessel is worth its price tag?  </P> <P> One way is to hire a marine surveyor to inspect and appraise the boat before  you buy it. Most banks and insurance companies require a professional survey  before they will finance or insure a used vessel. Some even require surveys of  new boats.  </P> <P> Smart buyers hire a surveyor before plopping down their life savings to buy a  trim beauty that may turn out to be a floating lemon in disguise. Surveyors can  help dampen the ardor of such misplaced love, saving you thousands of dollars  and years of heartache.  </P> <P> "I remember a man who was paying $20,000 for a steel boat," says one marine  surveyor, who asked not to be identified. "I took one look at the boat and it  looked like trouble. I tapped it with my hammer and knocked a hole right  through the hull. I told the man the boat was worthless. But he was already in  love with the boat and he kept saying, 'But is anything really wrong with it?'  It took me 30 minutes to explain to him all the things that were wrong with the  boat. In the end, he decided not to buy it."  </P> <P> Marine surveyors -- professionals who crawl through boats, tapping on hulls,  inspecting hoses, poking fingers into bilges -- are a misunderstood lot,  according to Newport Beach surveyor Mike Ramey. "Most people think a marine  survey means going out and measuring the depth of the ocean. That is not what  it is at all."  </P> <P> Marine surveyors spend hours inspecting boats to make sure they are safe and  sound. "A survey is pretty comprehensive," says Ron Tyson, who has been  inspecting vessels for 10 years. "We look at it from stem to stern and look at  every system from machinery to electronics to heads. A survey is a safety  inspection of the vessel. We are looking at the boat to make sure it complies  with National Fire Protection Agency standards and to American Boat and  Yachting Council standards."  </P> <P> Most surveyors have a few safety horror stories to tell. For example, Ramey  remembers walking on a live-aboard boat in Newport Beach and looking in the  bilges. "The bilges were filled with gasoline," he says. "The fuel tanks had  leaks in them and the people had been living on this boat and had not noticed.  Why it never caught on fire is still a mystery to me."  </P> <P> Looking for leaky fuel lines is top priority for most surveyors. A recent  change in Coast Guard rules requires all boat owners to replace old neoprene  fuel lines with new approved fuel lines, according to Tyson. The change was  required because the additives in the new, unleaded gasolines can permeate the  old hoses, resulting in dangerous fuel leaks.  </P> <P> "Still, three years after the change, we are finding boats with these old  lines," he says. "I just surveyed an old gasoline-powered boat that had the  neoprene-type lines."  </P> <P> Tyson's survey report included the requirement that the boat's fuel lines be  replaced to prevent a potential gas leak. "Gasoline in the bilge is the  equivalent of throwing a lighted stick of dynamite down there," he says.  </P> <P> Other common problems encountered by surveyors include deteriorated hose clamps  that could cause a boat to take on water and sink; improperly installed bilge  pumps; running lights that don't work, and leaks in the exhaust system.  </P> <P> "My theory is that if you don't find something wrong with the boat, then you  are not doing your job as a surveyor," says Roby Bessent, a Long Beach surveyor  who conducts surveying seminars for Orange Coast College.  </P> <P> In addition to the safety aspect of the survey, another important part is the  appraisal. "We go through and establish a replacement and market value," Tyson  says. "Banks and insurance companies are interested in these before they will  make a loan or place an insurance value on a boat."  </P> <P> Surveyor Ramey says: "We arrive at an appraisal so that boats are not sold for  way more than they are worth."  </P> <P> Marine surveyors are not licensed, but most do belong to professional  organizations such as the National Assn. of Marine Surveyors. And many, such as  Roby Bessent, who has been surveying boats in California for 27 years, are  licensed skippers.  </P> <P> Others such as Gary Worobec of G.T.W. Marine Surveys are former boat builders.  "A surveyor needs a good, basic, general boating background," says Worobec, who  also worked as a diesel mechanic. "And you have to be able to write, because a  survey is actually a story about the boat. We go through the different aspects  of the boat and inspect it. There are a lot of people who can inspect a vessel,  but if you can't put it down on paper, it is not of use to anyone."  </P> <P> Worobec suggests that, if you are looking for a reputable surveyor, you ask a  bank or an insurance company who they use. "This is like any other professional  business," he says. "If your phone does not ring, you are just another guy on  the street. Good surveyors have experience and a professional clientele that  relies on them for services."  </P> <P> In the surveying profession, reputation is everything, Ramey says. "Banks,  lending institutions and so forth do not deal with firms that are not  reputable," he says. "Surveyors are usually people who have been in the marine  field for a long time."  </P> <P> Most surveyors charge according to the length of the boat; prices range from $8  to $11 a foot.  </P></p>

			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Clinton denies shake-up plan President Bill Clinton has denied that he plans imminent changes to his much criticised foreign policy team. In a weekend interview with the Los Angeles Times, Mr Clinton conceded he had problems communicating his foreign policy goals to the public at large. But that deficiency, he said, should not be laid at the door of either Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, or Mr Anthony Lake, the national security adviser. The president said he had talked to 'a huge number of people' about foreign policy in recent weeks, mostly because it had been subject to what he called 'relentless criticism.' He could well imagine that an impression had been left that he was planning to reshuffle his team but he suggested that his secretary of state, in particular, was involved in delicate and indispensable negotiations in the Middle East and over China. Mr Clinton's decision last week to renew China's most favoured nation trading status without reference to its human rights record has again produced a wave of political and media criticism for his lack of foreign policy constancy. This, in turn, has given new impetus to the rumours that have periodically swept over Washington for months about the fate of Mr Christopher and Mr Lake, old colleagues from the Carter administration. Popular variations have had both replaced by their deputies, Mr Strobe Talbott and Mr Sandy Berger, respectively. An alternative version has had Mr Talbott, a friend of the president dating back to their Oxford days, move to take over the national security council from Mr Lake. This post does not require approval by the Senate, where earlier this year over 30 members voted not to confirm Mr Talbott as deputy secretary of state. Another widely canvassed option had Mr Clinton appointing a generally respected heavy hitter as the new secretary of state. This might be even a Republican or, in a total coup de theatre, retired General Colin Powell, until last year head of the joint chiefs of staff. Matched against all this speculation have been two serious factors. First, there is no hard evidence that Mr Clinton, having already ditched his first secretary of defence, Mr Les Aspin, has lost confidence in Mr Christopher or Mr Lake in the face of the critical battery. Second, a change at the foreign policy helm now would be freely interpreted as a sign of weakness and a distraction from domestic policy priorities in the run-up to mid-term congressional elections that already have the White House and the Democratic party nervous. It would seem more appropriate for Mr Clinton to entertain a reshuffle some time well into next year. Candidates then for the State Department might include Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader who is retiring at the end of this year, or a party heavyweight such as Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, whom Mr Clinton approached during the transition about becoming secretary of state.</p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Brussels probes plan for Italy steel takeover The European Commission has raised 'serious doubts' about the competition implications of a German-Italian bid for the special steels division of Ilva, Italy's state-owned steel producer. The German-Italian consortium won the bid for the division, Acciai Speciali Terni (AST), in June, outbidding Franco-Italian competitors with an offer of almost L600bn (Pounds 240m). Yesterday, however, Brussels opened an in-depth investigation into the offer, on the grounds that the merged group could dominate the European stainless steel market. The inquiry, which follows a one-month preliminary examination of the bid, could last up to four months, casting further doubt over the Italian state's attempts to privatise the steel sector. Usinor Sacilor, the French steelmaker involved in the rival consortium, warned in June that it would complain to the Commission if the German-Italian offer was approved by Iri, the Italian state holding company. The winning consortium is led by Krupp Hoesch, Germany's second biggest steelmaker, which would control 50 per cent of AST. The rest would go to three Italian steelmakers, Riva, Agarini and Falck. After acquiring AST, Krupp Hoesch's share of the European stainless steel market would rise from 27 to 43 per cent. The German company's 50 per cent stake in AST was to have become part of a joint venture between Krupp Hoesch and Thyssen, Germany's largest steelmaker, which came into being on October 1. There are suggestions that Krupp's offer of a joint venture to take over AST also encouraged Riva to withdraw its offer for Eko Stahl, the ailing eastern German steel mill in which it had an interest earlier this year.

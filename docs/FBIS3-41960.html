			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Phaisan Phutbongkhon: "Are Thai Workers in Libya </F> in Danger?"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The question which  causes concern is whether the 10,000 Thai workers in Libya will  have to leave. And if they have to leave, will they return home  or will they find work in other countries beforehand. It is  certain that this problem will cause difficulties for Thai  workers and their families at home and perhaps even for the  government.    This is another big problem which might affect international  business, the labor business and the market for Thai labor.  [passage omitted]    This time America learned that Mr. Qadhdhafi was developing  the most dangerous chemical weapons people could devise which  could cause more suffering for those poisoned than nuclear  weapons.    America could not allow Libya to continue to develop such  chemical weapons because they would present a serious danger to  American allies including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait as well as  some other Arab states. Even Europe and America itself were  threatened. Therefore America developed the plan to bomb the  chemical weapons plant.    One must believe that America was concerned about Thailand  and the Thai workers and so called for a withdrawal from the  area beforehand. America feared that with the bombing many Thai  workers would be injured and killed, and this might affect  relations with the Thai government. As one Thai person I would  like to thank America for the relatives of those Thai workers.    We Thai are the most peculiar people on earth. We get  involved in various situations in various countries throughout  the world. In many cases even the Thai government does not know  about them. In almost every Arab country there are Thai people  working at many different jobs from the lowest level to  positions close to the leadership.    The "Saudi Diamond Case," which is so famous there is no  telling how it will end, came about because we Thai went to work  at the highest levels of the palace in Saudi Arabia. And the  person who made it possible for Thailand and Thai people to be  disgraced throughout the world turned out to be a Thai policeman.    In Libya it seems that there are Thai people working close  to  the leader, Mr. Qadhdhafi, who even peel fruit for him. At the  factory which is to be bombed there are many Thai construction  workers.    In fact if America had asked for good intelligence or at  least had asked for cooperation from the Minister of Interior or  asked my associates, then America's intelligence would have been  better because Mr. Chiu or my associates could not be considered  weak in intelligence.    It would appear that General Chawalit Yongchaiyut even had  good information about who led the military leadership to  believe that General Chawalit or Mr. Den Tomina was behind the  burning of the school in the South and supported the  partitioning of the land. It was a just a question of solving  the political puzzle.    Many intelligence sources agreed that the target factory was  under construction. But it was not clear whether it was a  factory for chemical weapons or not. The construction this time  was in an underground foundation, and a company from England, an  American ally, was the contractor. By the time this was  finished, it would have required at least two years to build the  building, and it would have required a long time to assemble the  machinery etc. Altogether it would have taken at least four  years. By that time we would have been in the second or third  Chuan government, or my Prime Minister Chuan, might not be in  power any more.    The engineers for this factory were not just anybody. They  were German engineers, and it was a company from Germany, an  American ally. In a situation like this America should have  known about this just as my Mr. Chiu knew. Why were they so  concerned now? And it does not appear that Germany and England  were warned to stop assisting the construction.    I feel that if America were genuinely concerned about the  Thai workers, then it should have been no less concerned about  the well-being and lives of the Germans and English. And if one  considers the length of time [until completion] then the time to  bomb would be when the factory is completed in two years because  then an enormous investment could be destroyed at one time. In  addition it would help America's allies to get the income from  the project. Or the allies might be able to gain additional  intelligence. It would appear that England feels the same.    Now I feel that the message to remove the Thai workers from  Libya is strange somehow.    When one thinks about it, if the Thai workers are removed  and  the timing of the bombing is changed to two years in the future,  where does the labor come from to do the work?    If one looks around, one can see three possible sources:  South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. I think Vietnam would do the  physical work while South Korea or Taiwan might supervise the  construction.    If one thinks like this, one comes to the realization that  this would be similar to economic assistance to Vietnam and  setting up lines of communication with Vietnam. And the gaining  of this experience by Vietnam could be important for opposition  to China in the future.    We Thai might have to pay the price for stupidity.    We must call on the Thai government to consider this  carefully. It should quickly withdraw the Thai workers for whom  there is concern before it is necessary.    The homework for the Minister of Labor in this matter is  very  heavy because if America does not listen and bombs now then I  feel we will lose some people.</p>

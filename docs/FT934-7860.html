			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Economic Viewpoint: New light on 'trust versus law' In the course of preparing some essays for publication, I had to look at a chapter I had written for a book which appeared in 1989, to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Thatcher government. The point was to see what, if anything, should be added by way of postscript. The answer was: Surprisingly little. That government made a start in removing some of the impediments to economic success. During the post-Thatcher years the ground seemed to have been lost again, first because of the resurgence of inflation and the high interest rates needed to combat it; and afterwards by the recession which proved longer, more drawn out and more debilitating than almost anyone expected. Recently, however, international comparisons have moved in favour of the UK again. Recovery, if patchy and uncertain, has arrived earlier than in continental Europe, while Japan is stuck in a deep recession; and the economic debate has moved to the labour market rigidities which the UK has taken a lead in removing. But the statistical dust of at least another business cycle will have to settle down - and the last one went on for over a decade - before any quantitative conclusions can be drawn. Thus I was glad to come across a book which moves away from inconclusive numerical comparisons and sheds some light on why even someone who welcomed the 1980s emphasis on competition and deregulation should still feel uneasy about some of the cultural aspects of the Thatcher revolution, including those that live on under the Major government. The book in question is The Economics of Business Culture by Mark Casson (published by the Clarendon Press in 199l). It may be a surprising one for a advocate of market competition to cite. For the author seems to hanker after something like the 'business plan for Britain' with which John Smith wooed gullible CBI members at Harrogate this week. And Casson does not devote nearly enough attention to the role of competition in providing new products and new processes, and putting downward pressure on prices. Yet the best way to approach such a book is to see what can be learned from it rather than where it is open to question. Professor Casson's object is to develop a rigorous economic theory which retains the central position of rationality in traditional economics and of the individual as the unit of decision, but which drops the postulates of materialism and selfishness. Without having worked through all the detailed chapters, it is difficult to say how far he has succeeded - the book deserves more attention than it has received. Most of the analysis relates to the internal relations of organisations. The pupil who shared my first year economics supervision at Cambridge, and who worried about the selfish motives of the textbook businessman who tried to equate marginal cost with marginal revenue, might still not have known how to react, even if he had been able to foresee this book. Nor is it clear how the advice of top Treasury officials such as Sir Terence Burns or Professor Alan Budd about the forthcoming UK Budget would be different if they had absorbed Casson's message. Yet the basic thought behind it is sound. This is that the largest costs in a modern economy are transaction costs, and that these are minimised in an atmosphere of trust - in contrast to an atmosphere where everyone tries to take advantage of everyone else, and no-one moves without a lawyer. An example of what can go wrong has just been given by a so-called rightwing member of the British cabinet, John Redwood, when he spoke of the growth in the number of distant Health Service 'managers in grey suits' all too ready to solve their problems by closing down hospital wards. What Casson does not explain is how to combine co-operation and trust within organisations without this extending to anti-competitive collusion between them. I still think the best solution is the one outlined in my 1985 Wincott Lecture: an honest explanation of the benefits of competition and the profit motive as a means to the general welfare, without making this part of the 'devil take the hindmost' view of life, so bitterly satirised in J B Priestley's play An Inspector Calls, now enjoying such a successful revival in London. Competition as a system of economic relations need not be based on personal hatred or mutual hostility. Rival small entrepreneurs linked by electronic cable to their main customers or suppliers need hardly be more aware of each other's existence than the small farmers of Thomas Jefferson's ideal republic. Market economics comes in many shapes and sizes. Casson puts his finger on the mark when he writes that that the supply side package imported from the US 'comes laden with certain cultural presuppositions - amongst them the view that because people cannot be trusted, formal methods of enforcing competition between them are essential in all areas of activity . . . The US emphasis on the law as an enforcement mechanism is a related cultural attitude which may not 'travel' well.' He also describes the way in which these attitudes have been borrowed from the US when many successful private enterprise organisations are making their management styles more human and informal, supposedly under Japanese influence. Thus his unease extends beyond British admirers of US economic and management styles and extends to the tenor of the advice that the mainstream international organisations are giving the former communist and developing countries. How does this analysis apply to current contentious issues, such as the (now stalling) initiative to reform the civil service through devolution to smaller agencies and through market testing of services to ascertain whether they should stay the public sector? Casson seems to see such initiatives as characteristic of an authoritarian leader who not only does not trust other people in general but 'cannot even trust a few people to do his monitoring for him. The leader will also favour strong interpersonal competition, sustained by making people rivals for one another's jobs. The intensity of competition may be further raised by creating a pool of unemployed or marginal members who are ready to step into other people's jobs at short notice.' These words may be a good description of how cabinets are reshuffled in Britain. But if one wants a more co-operative style in government in general, smaller units are the first essential. Loyalty and non-material satisfactions are likely to be more important in an independent hospital or in a hived-off administrative unit than in a vast organisation like the National Health Service. Nor, indeed, did proposals to hive off units originate with the Thatcher administration. They date back further. I first came across them in a 1960s Fabian pamphlet. Permanent secretaries who are obstructing the hiving-off drive, or proposals to advertise senior Whitehall appointments, are behaving more like male baboons fighting for territory than crusaders for higher values. Many people have described the paradox that market liberalisation has gone hand-in-hand with a shift of power from intermediate sources of authority to central government. Casson is right to detect incipient authoritarianism behind free market rhetoric. But another factor has surely been an excess of caution. Governments have not had the courage to undertake the drastic reforms which would make, for instance, local authorities or universities responsible for the bulk of their own financing. This is why Whitehall centralisers have acquired their hold. Perhaps the answer to the paradoxes generated by the Thatcher attempt to get the state off the people's back is to carry it further and really mean it.</p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / International Company News: Top Japanese brokers face downgrading MOODY'S Investment Service, the US credit rating agency, has placed the credit ratings of Japan's Big Four brokerage houses - Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities - under review for possible downgrades. Moody's said it would focus on the long-term earnings outlook and cost-control measures of the securities houses. While the recent rise in the Tokyo stock market has encouraged hopes among investors of an earnings recovery, Japanese brokers still face high operating costs due to the over-expansion of the 1980s. The brokers have not been able to produce effective cost cutting measures, due to the Japanese practice of life-time employment. Financial deregulation, where the barrier between the securities and banking industries is expected to be eased next year, will also affect brokers' profitability. Nomura currently has a long-term debt rating of Aa2, Daiwa A1, Nikko A2, and Yamaichi A3.</p>

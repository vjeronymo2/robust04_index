It is not known for how long this situation will  last; it depends on the resumption of normal coal production in  the Kolubara complex, Miodrag Simic, the technical operations  manager of the Belgrade Electricity board said at a news  conference today. [passage omitted]    According to information available to the Belgrade  Electricity Board it is not certain that the miners will go back  to work and resume coal deliveries. According to Simic, if the  power plant in Obrenovac does not resume work, half the Belgrade  population will have only candles for light during New Year's  Eve. [passage omitted]</p>

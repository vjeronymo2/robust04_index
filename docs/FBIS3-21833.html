He stressed that there are very strong interests behind the  clashes.    Governor Ruffo said at a news conference in Mexicali, the  state capital, that his administration will continue  investigations even though the PGR has declared the case closed.    In Tijuana, Jorge Alvarez Barrieri, commander of the second  sector of the State Judicial Police, said there are political  motives behind the detentions and arrest warrants issued against  members of the state judicial police as charges were fabricated  against Deputy Prosecutor Sergio Ortiz Lara and PGR Agent Juan  Carlos Guerrero Cermeno, both of whom have been accused of  releasing three suspects.    Victor Clark Alfaro, director of the Binational Human Rights  Center, said the judicial agents who are under arrest and those  whose arrests have been ordered are only scapegoats and the real  culprits have not even been mentioned. Clark Alfaro has  demanded an investigation of State Prosecutor Juan Franciso  Franco Rios as nobody can lift a finger without Franco Rios'  authorization.    The 3 March shoot-out left four people dead, including two  members of the Federal Judicial Police and one member of the  State Judicial Police.    Deputy Attorney General Alfonso Cabrera Morales held a news  conference on 7 March and said State Judicial Police agents were  responsible for the shoot-out as they were protecting Ismael  Higuera Guerrero, an assistant of the Arellano Felix brothers.</p>

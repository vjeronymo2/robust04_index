			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / French business confidence sinks FRENCH business confidence has plunged over the past month, providing further evidence that the economy could be drifting into recession, writes William Dawkins. A poll of 3,300 company directors by the Insee statistics institute shows universal worry about the outlook for all sectors. It comes in the wake of a series of depressing economic indicators, including stubbornly high unemployment, and falls in retail sales and industrial production over the past quarter. September jobless figures are expected to show a slight rise on the current 10.2 per cent rate.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary signed GeWe: "A Question of Direction"] </F>   [Text] In spite of a few milestones such as the signatures  beneath the partnership agreement with Russia, and the accession  treaties with Austria, Norway, Finland, and Sweden, there is a  great shadow over the summit meeting in Corfu which was  completed on Saturday [25 June]. The Twelve were unable to  agree on a new president of the European Commission. Once  again, it was the fault of John Major, for whom the 11:1  grouping is becoming a habit, just as it was for his predecessor  Margaret Thatcher. On the surface it is a poker game with  people, but there is much more to it than that: It is a  question of what kind of Europe is to come out of the Twelve, or  the Sixteen.    John Major and his Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd twisted and  turned like eels, first denouncing the disputed Franco-German  approach for Dehaene's nomination, then criticizing his belated  official candidature. They were unable to hide the fact that  the real issue is something quite different: The development of  the European Union into a federalist structure, which is what  most of the member states want, or a Europe of nation states  with all the risks and inadequacies that an excessively  nationalistic orientation entail.    Many things become clear both from statements by Major  himself and by the British delegation: "Dehaene -- an  interventionist," "It's a matter of a particular conception of  Europe," and from their behaviour. Initially, Major supported  his fellow countryman Sir Leon Brittan. Although this was  legitimate, it suggested that London hoped for a British Europe.  When Brittan's candidature was not supported by any other  member, the Prime Minister switched to Lubbers' side. After the  "Atlanticists" from The Hague eventually threw in the towel,  Major became stubborn and used his veto. Dehaene was not  acceptable, and it was a matter of principle. In other words,  London was afraid of excessive interference by Brussels in  national affairs, a continuation of the Delors course and the  creation of a Europe on Maastricht lines.    Maastricht Europe is not a negative concept. After all, it  was drafted in 1991 under the Luxembourg presidency with  constructive assistance mainly from the founding members of the  EU. For the British, however, the term means the same as it  does for the anti-Europeans here: Brussels centralism,  federalism, industrial policy, in short, "socialism by the back  door" which scares the British Tories stiff.    Obviously, the nomination of the president of the Commission  is connected with a certain direction. For this reason,  Mitterrand and Kohl, both convinced Europeans, committed  themselves to their much-criticized initiative for Dehaene and  not for Lubbers who, as Council President, had already made too  many concessions to Major in Maastricht in their opinion. This  legitimate game has now been thwarted. Ought the British to  have joined the initiative earlier? No, because there is nothing  to suggest that there would have been agreement on a compromise  candidate prior to the summit.    Where do we go from here? The Twelve have an obligation to  the citizens of Europe and their mouthpiece, the European  Parliament. Any unfinished business will have to be completed on  15 July. Countries such as Luxembourg are still sticking to  Dehaene's nomination. Major, however, is once again so far off  course that any backing down on his part would probably put him  out of 10 Downing Street for good this time. He has said he  will never ever change his mind. These are the words of someone  whose political fate is at stake if he makes a U-turn.    As it is a matter of urgency that the European Parliament  ratify the new Commission on time, the telephone lines between  the capital cities will become hot in the next few days. There  is probably little point if several candidates line up again at  the special summit in Brussels, since Corfu has shown that even  the very mother of parliaments can sweep away democratic  conventions (respecting the principle of the majority) because  its own requirements were not satisfied.    The Eleven have no reason to go too far to meet the wishes  of  the British. The crisis would be the lesser of two evils.  Ultimately, it is actually a question of what direction the  European Union will take to overcome the division of our  continent.</p>

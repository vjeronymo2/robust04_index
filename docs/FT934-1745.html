			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / BR to sell track maintenance units British Rail is to sell its track maintenance and renewals operations, which employ 33,500 people and have an annual turnover of Pounds 1bn, the government announced yesterday. The aim of the sale is to give Railtrack, the company which will manage BR's track and signalling, a choice of contractors, Mr Roger Freeman, minister for public transport, said yesterday. It is not clear how profitable these activities are for BR but the government hopes for bids from civil engineering companies, electrical engineers and construction companies. It does not expect management buy-outs to emerge. Maintenance contracts typically run for between three and five years while track renewal programmes last two to three years. BR currently operates these businesses from 14 profit centres but plans to separate the maintenance operation from track re-newal. The intention is to create a new division - British Rail Infrastructure Services - in April and to separate the two sides of the business a year later. They will be offered for sale in 1995 and the transfer to the private sector will take place by April 1996. The Department of Transport yesterday announced the signing of a 13-year contract for BR to carry mail for the Post Office. The Post Office is to build a distribution centre linking road and rail connections in Willesden, north-west London. The Post Office will also buy 16 new mail trains for Pounds 40m. They will be built at the Derby workshops of ABB, the rolling-stock manufac-turer. BR runs 62 trains a day for the Royal Mail, of which 24 are travelling post offices on which mail is sorted in transit. A quarter of all mail is carried by rail. Responsibility for the Ashford International railway station on the Channel tunnel link has been handed over to the John Laing construction company. Laing will build the station and car parks at its own cost and risk in return for a fee related to the number of passengers who use the station. The Pounds 30m project is due to be completed at the end of 1995. More than 2m people are expected to be using the station by the end of the decade.</p>

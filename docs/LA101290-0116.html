			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CENSUS STAFF TO INVESTIGATE UNDERCOUNT COMPLAINTS  </P> <P> The U.S. Census Bureau has agreed to investigate the claims of 17% of the  nation's cities, counties and towns -- including the city of Los Angeles --  that the 1990 preliminary census missed thousands of housing units across the  country.  </P> <P> In all, the bureau has accepted for review the challenges of 6,602 communities,  including 128 in Southern California, while rejecting 983 challenges  nationwide. Over the next week or so, census workers are expected to recanvass  homes in many of these communities and will add inhabitants of houses they  missed to the census roll.  </P> <P> The claims of inaccuracies surfaced last month when local governments across  the country took issue with the Census Bureau's preliminary population count.  </P> <P> Subsequently, cities and counties were given the opportunity to analyze the  bureau's preliminary tally -- comparing the bureau's list of households with  local inventories.  </P> <P> Twenty of the nation's largest cities reported discrepancies of more than  570,000 housing units. Los Angeles city officials reported that the census  missed nearly 49,000 dwellings, or almost 6%.  </P> <P> Among the cities challenging the census in California are both slow- and  fast-growing communities. Oakland, according to the latest census figures, grew  6% to 360,000 people, but officials there believe the count missed 500 houses  and apartments. Cathedral City was the state's fastest-growing city, jumping by  600% over the last decade. Local officials contend the Census Bureau may have  missed 4,000 people, or 12% of the city's population.  </P> <P> Of the 39,198 local governments nationwide, only one in four communities  officially responded to the preliminary census figures and as many as a quarter  of those said they accepted the bureau's preliminary counts.  </P> <P> In Washington, census officials interpreted this as a sign that despite  vociferous complaints from a number of large cities, including New York and Los  Angeles, the vast majority of the nation's towns and cities were satisfied with  the census. Many legislators, however, have taken a different view.  </P> <P> "Barbara Bryant (director of the Census Bureau) argues that it's a sign the  census is going well because 80% of the jurisdictions did not complain," said  an aide to Rep. Thomas Sawyer, an Ohio Democrat who heads the congressional  subcommittee on population and census. "Far from indicating that 80% were  satisfied with the results, we believe that most jurisdictions lacked the time  or the resources to mount a challenge."  </P> <P> The Census Bureau's preliminary population count was 245.8 million, short of  the 250 million mark the bureau had estimated before the 1990 census began.  </P> <P> In both the House of Representatives and Senate, legislation has been  introduced that would prohibit the Census Bureau from releasing official  population figures until officials decide whether to revise the traditional  head count by using a controversial statistical method. The technique,  generally supported by big-city Democrats and opposed by suburban and  small-town Republicans, would give relative weight to areas of the country that  are thought to be routinely undercounted, such as inner cities with large black  and other minority populations and rural communities.  </P> <P> A number of cities challenging the preliminary census results have decided to  join New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Dade County (Miami) in a lawsuit,  originally filed in 1988, designed to force the bureau to use the so-called  post-enumeration survey.  </P></p>

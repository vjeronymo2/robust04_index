			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Go-ahead for ASH scrip plan AUTOMATED Security (Holdings), the alarm leasing group, has gone ahead with its enhanced scrip dividend despite a sharp fall in its share price since it fixed the reference price a week ago, as a result of a profit warning last Friday. The Stock Exchange still has to announce whether it is admitting the new shares to the Official List, although admission is normally a formality. The group said the scheme was approved at a board meeting yesterday. Going ahead with the scrip saves ASH Pounds 4m through a Pounds 3.1m cash saving on the dividend payment and a Pounds 900,000 reduction in advance corporation tax payable. ASH said it was in the interests of the company and its shareholders to proceed. Under the terms of the scheme, shareholders were offered an interim dividend of 3.03p in cash or 4.58p payable in new shares. Its share price fell 30p to 102p on Friday and yesterday closed at 97p, down 6p on the day. At this level, tax-paying shareholders would almost have been better off taking the cash dividend rather than the enhanced scrip. A reference price of 142p a share was set by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, parent of de Zoete &amp; Bevan, then one of ASH's joint brokers, at the market close on Tuesday last week, relating to the share price over the previous two hours. At this price, 3.21m shares needed to be issued to satisfy the 87.5 per cent take up of the enhanced scrip. The broker then auctioned 892,000 of the new shares which investors had elected to sell at a strike price of 136p, 95.8 per cent of the reference price. On Friday last week, ASH warned that its third quarter profits would be hit by Pounds 3m of exceptional costs. De Zoete &amp; Bevan resigned as joint broker to ASH on Friday when the company refused to either cancel or amend the terms of the scrip offer. As foreshadowed by last Friday's warning, ASH's pre-tax profits for the nine months ending August 31, announced yesterday after the market closed, were sharply down, falling by 75 per cent to Pounds 9.17m. Total operating profit fell from Pounds 22.8m to Pounds 15.2m. However, this time there was a charge on discontinued operations of Pounds 2.1m incurred through the closure of the fire systems division. Previously discontinued operations contributed Pounds 5.5m. The latest pre-tax figure included restructuring costs of Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 3.7m) and interest payments of Pounds 4.9m (Pounds 12.6m). The comparable figure also included a profit of Pounds 30.3m on the sale of the group's loss prevention subsidiary. Total group turnover fell from Pounds 135m to Pounds 118m, although the previous figure included Pounds 46.4m from discontinued operations compared with Pounds 9.1m this time. Earnings fell from 21.5p to 2p. The tax charge was down from Pounds 7.56m to Pounds 1.5m, reflecting the saving on ACT through the enhanced scrip dividend scheme.</p>

			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / France (6): Support falters for main parties - Politicians' fortunes are being buffeted by wild swings in public opinion IN 18 short months, the mood of the French government has swung wildly from triumph to despair and half way back again. As battle raged in the Gulf War, President Mitterrand and his then prime minister, Mr Michel Rocard, were both at the peak of their popularity. But by last autumn the President and his new prime minister, Mrs Edith Cresson, were both sinking to record depths in the popularity polls. At that moment the regime seemed in a state of terminal depression and even disintegration. The Socialist Party was apparently doomed to suffer a crushing defeat at the next general elections; the party was almost openly at war with the President; it even seemed uncertain whether he could survive to the end of his term. Today the mood has swung round again. Mrs Cresson has been replaced by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, and the change of cast is working wonders for the image of the government and the popularity of the President; the polls are once more giving a little buoyancy, the President is back in battling form, and no-one now suggests that he might be forced into early retirement. These contrasts of mood are so volatile that one might be tempted to discount them as manifestations of a Latin addiction to melodrama. Yet the dispassionate facts are equally volatile. In the first round of the 1988 general elections, the Socialist Party scored nearly 35 per cent of the popular vote. This was not quite enough to lead to an absolute majority in the National Assembly, but it was enough to make the PS the largest single party in France by a wide margin. Less than four years on, in the regional elections of March this year, the Socialist vote had dropped by almost half to a shrivelled 18.3 per cent. However, this stunning collapse in the Socialist vote in March did not do the traditional conservative parties any good. In the first round of the general election in 1988, the Gaullists and the centre-right UDF umbrella grouping together scored just over 38 per cent; in March this year their combined vote fell to 33 per cent. In other words, the three main-line parties of government did so badly that they could only score just over 51 per cent of the vote between them. Their collective set-back was reflected in a mushrooming of voter support for a wide gamut of protest parties: the big break-through was made by the two ecological parties which scored 13.9 per cent between them; but the extreme right-wing National Front also moved ahead with 13.9 per cent. Polling evidence suggests several reasons why the mainstream political parties lost support in the March elections. To many Frenchmen the political class appears remote, elitist and indifferent to the concerns of ordinary people. In addition there is a strong whiff of corruption hanging over the political parties, especially but not only the Socialist Party, as a result of repeated revelations of illicit party financing. But perhaps the strongest common reason for popular alienation is that the Socialist Party and the conservative opposition parties all present a wearying spectacle of constant jockeying for position between rival contenders for leadership. The right wing has long been disfigured by the feuding between former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing of the UDF and former prime minister Jacques Chirac of the Gaullists, both of whom are determined to stand for the Presidency in 1995. But the image of the Socialist Party was also seriously damaged at its Congress in Rennes in 1990, by the open power battle which broke out between warring factions. This Socialist power battle, which was waged between three main factions, was this year fought to a realignment which effectively transfers control of the Party to Mr Laurent Fabius, leader of a breakaway faction mustering around 30 per cent of the party activists. In the past Mr Fabius had made several previous attempts to take over the party leadership, but each time he was blocked by a tacit alliance between the factions of Mr Lionel Jospin, representing the traditional party leadership, and Mr Michel Rocard, the former prime minister. In January this year, however, Mr Rocard switched sides and Mr Fabius won the nomination as first secretary of the Socialist Party. As his side of the bargain, Mr Fabius tacitly endorsed Mr Rocard as the Socialist Party's 'virtual' candidate in the next Presidential elections. Such an endorsement is a gesture, not a commitment; but it should lead to a formal adoption of Mr Rocard's candidacy by the Party, which would then be almost irreversible. The full extent of Mr Fabius' victory only gradually became obvious. When President Mitterrand dismissed Mrs Cresson as prime minister in April, he replaced her by Mr Beregovoy, a leading member of the Fabius faction, while Mr Jospin was excluded from the government altogether. By the time of the next general elections in March next year, therefore, the Socialist Party should look a good deal more disciplined, if not united, than it has in the past couple of years. The conservative parties have in the past been seriously weakened by their divisions, and Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Mr Jacques Chirac have both paid lip service to the necessity of uniting their forces. In principle they are now committed to the idea of holding a primary selection process, to decide which of them should be the conservative candidate in the next Presidential election. But their solemn assurances have never sounded fully reliable and will be severely tested by their profound policy disagreements over the Maastricht Treaty in the debate looming ahead. In the wake of the March regional elections, Le Monde ran an ironic cartoon which showed a ceremonial major-domo addressing the crowd on the steps of the presidential palace: 'Attention] Stand aside]', he was saying. 'The President will now bounce back]' At the time, the fortunes of the government and the Socialist Party had sunk so low that it seemed inconceivable that the President could ever 'bounce back'. Today, the balance of forces between government and opposition is again more evenly matched. The odds remain that the Socialists will be defeated in the general elections of March 1993, possibly by a wide margin; but it is also conceivable that the political struggle over Maastricht will so divide the conservative parties as to weaken their electoral chances. The one thing we know for certain is that President Mitterrand is never beaten until the battle is over, and the battle is not over yet.</p>

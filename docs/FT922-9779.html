			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / International Company News: DSM tumbles 43% as margins tighten DSM, the Dutch chemicals group, said net profit tumbled 43.8 per cent in the 1992 first quarter, reflecting lower profit margins in hydrocarbons and polymers, its biggest division. Net profit fell sharply to Fl 100m (Dollars 54m) from Fl 178m a year earlier, when business was already weak because of the Gulf war. The first-quarter result was, however, up 12 per cent from the second half of 1991. Turnover declined 6 per cent to Fl 2.43bn, with a 9 per cent increase in volume sales only partially compensating for the average 15 per cent drop in selling prices. Acquisitions accounted for about half the increase in volume sales. The first-quarter downturn, in line with company's expectations, was due to narrowing profit margins, particularly in hydrocarbons and polymers. DSM said it could not predict full-year profits because of uncertainty in worldwide economic recovery and currency movements. Group operating profit mirrored the development in net profit, falling 43 per cent to Fl 140m from Fl 245m. DSM's financial charges almost trebled to Fl 32m from Fl 11m a year earlier, due to an unspecified increase in borrowing. However, the company's tax bill fell to just Fl 11m from Fl 61m, reflecting a higher percentage of tax-exempt income in the total result.</p>

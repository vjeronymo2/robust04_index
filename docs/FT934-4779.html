			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Arts: 'Celestina', the bygone blockbuster - Theatre 'Arguably Europe's first blockbuster' is how the advance blurb describes Fernando de Rojas's La Celestina (1499, with over 60 re-prints before 1600). The story it tells is all about love - in particular, carnal love overwhelming courtly love. Its title character is a bawd who makes profit by using sorcery. She helps one man, Calisto, turn his unreciprocated courtly love for Melibea into reciprocated passion. The tale is satirical, and it ends bitterly. Passion leads to date rape, while the financial greed involved in Celestina's schemes leads to her death and that of her envious assistants. Calisto's heartless enjoyment of Melibea backfires on him, and leads to his accidental death: whereupon Melibea, still ardent for him but still sore that he ever deflowered her, takes her own life. Love] Love the sweet poison, love the dear wound - 'Love, thou has the power to kill thy subjects.' I adore all this kind of stuff. But, never fear, Jilly Cooper and Co: this ex-blockbuster is not likely to knock you off the best-seller lists these days. Certainly not in this Actors Touring Company version, translated by James Mabbe and co-adapted by Max Hafler and Nick Philippou. (Philippou directs.) As performed here, the story simply becomes mildly camp. The noble characters speak in 'thees' and 'thous', whereas the vulgar people's talk is decidedly modern ('I'd rather neck with a leper'). This alternation becomes far-fetched, and the switch between 'thou' and 'you' occurs once in mid-sentence: 'Thou makest me believe you.' Each of the six actors has to represent at least two characters. The role-swapping is fun, and the performance is energetic, but nothing much stirs beneath the lively surface. Each character is simply an obvious 'type'. As the play proceeded, I grew interested by Mia Soteriou's vivid but unexaggerated account of two opposite roles, the virtuous maid Lucretia and Celestina's scheming daughter Elicia; and Lucy Whybrow as a shrill, plaintive Melibea and the gutsy good-time girl Areusa. But Ann Firbank plays Celestina as just an obvious crone. Sebastian Harcombe overdoes all Calisto's external features - glassy smile, pretty gestures, tremulous declamation - while never exposing any real erotic drive. The more serious the tale grows, the more enjoyable the performance becomes. You want to know what will happen next. But love? It was never in evidence for a moment. At the Lyric Studio, Hammersmith, W6, 081-741-2311, until December 11</p>

			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Renewed worries on inflation and disappointment at the outcome of the UK gilts auction sent stock index futures falling through 3,100, a recent support level, writes Joel Kibazo. The first trade in the September FT-SE 100 futures contract was struck at 3,121. It moved ahead as a leading UK house executed a 'roll over' trade from September into the December contract. However, the contract's advance was cut short mid-morning by the market's disappointment at the out come of the UK gilts auction. September drifted lower there after for the next few hours, only steadying around the lunch time period. The release of US durable goods figures brought another bout of active selling as dealers reflected on the possibility of an increase in interest rates. With the retreat on Wall Street increasing the downward pressure, September fell to the day's low of 3,082. Having briefly dipped to a discount during the afternoon slide, the contract finished at 3,087, at a 3 point premium to cash, with volume improving to 15,723 lots. The expiry of the July stock options was the main feature in the traded options sector. Total volume at the close was 30,948, with 11,863 dealt in the FT-SE 100 option British Steel was the busiest stock option at 1,349 lots.</p>

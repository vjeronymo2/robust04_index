			<p>BFN     [Text] We are presenting information supplied by CS agency  [as heard].    A CS information agency correspondent has been told by  Deputy  Security Minister Avtandil Ioseliani that a report broadcast in  an Alioni TV program alleging that quadripartite talks in Sochi  have failed does not correspond to the facts.    A meeting of the quadripartite commission on Abkhazia took  place in Sochi on 29 and 30 May. The meeting had to create a  foundation for the return of forcefully displaced people to  Abkhazia. During the meeting, the Abkhaz side demanded that a  paragraph be included in an application form according to which  Georgian refugees would promise to abide by Abkhazian laws. The  Georgian and Russian parties at the meeting unequivocally  rejected the demand because it was absurd to have a formulation  like this before an Abkhazian status had been established.    The meeting discussed an issue of registering refugees and  possibilities of information exchange in this connection. A  joint statement has been adopted.    According to Mr. Avtandil Ioseliani, the next meeting of the  quadripartite commission is to be held in Sochi on 20-21 June.</p>

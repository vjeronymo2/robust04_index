			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Rudkowski] </F>   [Excerpt] The first session of the Economic Council  established at the office of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet  chairman was held today. As everybody knows, there has never  been such a council in the Belarusian Supreme Soviet. Opening  the session, [Supreme Soviet Chairman] Mechyslaw Ivanavich Hryb  noted that the Supreme Soviet has not paid enough attention to  economic issues, saying that this has been a sort of negligence.    [Begin Hryb recording] The three years of reforms have not  brought about the desired results. I would rather the contrary:  The Belarusian economy is currently in a deep crisis. Although  the strategy of conducting market reforms in Belarus depends, to  a certain degree, not only on internal, but also external  factors, responsibility falls on the government as well as the  Supreme Soviet. Time has shown that the Legislative Branch can  do nothing but deal with this extremely important problem.  Legislative acts concerning the economy, which have been  adopted by the Supreme Soviet, require the most amount of  independent study. Also needed are broad consultations on these  problems. We should reexamine the course of socioeconomic  reforms and the social situation in Belarus. It is vital to find  a way out of the current situation. Examining and resolving  current problems should become the main goal of our Economic  Council. It is essential for the Supreme Soviet to know the  opinions of highly qualified specialists on prospects for the  development of our economy. We understand that it is virtually  impossible to alleviate the predicament without concentrating on  our intellectual potential. Therefore, it has been decided to  establish the Economic Council.    We have managed...[Hryb pauses] We should also create a more  operative body which would examine the issues of economic  development, present to the legislative, and possibly executive  authorities, specific proposals on ways of resolving economic  issues, predicting results of various phenomena, etc. Such a  structure, however, is more adequate for the presidential  office. Nevertheless, I believe that we cannot, and we do not  need to do this until the first president deals with this issue.  We must not waste our time. We have already wasted a lot of it.    Our first request to you is to present your opinion on  existing legislation of the Republic of Belarus, which concerns  economic issues. [end recording]    The Economic Council comprises scientists, economists, and  managers of industrial enterprises, joint ventures, and joint  stock companies, as well as firms and banks. Thus, the council  has united professionals who are supposed to work out a concept  for overcoming the economic crisis in Belarus. [passage omitted]</p>

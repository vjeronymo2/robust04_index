			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOORPARK;  </P> <P> COUNCIL SEAT TO BE FILLED BY ELECTION  </P> <P> The Moorpark City Council has decided to wait until a special election in March  to fill a seat on the governing panel left open when Councilman Paul Lawrason  was elected mayor earlier this month.  </P> <P> "I think it's a good idea to let the public decide who is going to sit in that  seat," Lawrason said after being sworn in as mayor Wednesday night.  </P> <P> "I don't see any value of appointing a short-term council member between now  and March and risking unbalancing the election process."  </P> <P> Lawrason, who has served on the council since 1988, beat fellow council member  Clint Harper in the mayor's race Nov. 6. Lawrason's council position expires in  two years.  </P> <P> Former Planning Commissioner John Wozniak, who defeated Councilwoman Eloise  Brown, was also sworn in Wednesday.  </P> <P> The council then voted to reappoint Planning Commissioners Roy Talley and Glen  Schmidt, and named new member Michael Wesner. The council decided to wait until  its next meeting Dec. 5 to make the remaining two appointments to the  commission.  </P> <P> The council also named three new members to the Parks and Recreation  Commission. They are John Hall, Sandy Thompson and Lynn Crockett. Ronald  Corzine and John Torres retained their posts. CARLOS V. LOZANO  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRUDEAU, DICKERSON SPUR THE COLTS, 42-13  </P> <P> It was a new Jack Trudeau and the old Eric Dickerson with a slightly different  twist.  </P> <P> Trudeau, pounded by opposing defenses and stung by the taunts and boos of  Indianapolis fans all season, passed for a career-high four touchdowns Sunday,  leading the Colts over the Miami Dolphins, 42-13.  </P> <P> His top receiver was Dickerson, who had nine catches and also ran for 107 yards  and two touchdowns.  </P> <P> "The key was Eric running his routes on the back side of our formations," said  Trudeau, who was knocked unconscious and hospitalized with a concussion only a  week earlier.  </P> <P> "He did a great job, and when I saw he was really attuned to what we were  doing, I was pretty sure we were going to have a great day. I don't know if  they really knew what we were going to do."  </P> <P> The victory lifted the Colts (8-7) into a three-way tie for first place in the  AFC East with Miami and Buffalo.  </P> <P> Miami Coach Don Shula called the loss "a major disappointment."  </P> <P> "It was a poor performance when everything is so meaningful in the game and the  season is on the line," the coach said.  </P> <P> "In the second half we couldn't generate anything. Our running game struggled.  Their offense was patient and did a good job. Dickerson is a great back. They  threw to him underneath, giving him running room, and he turned it loose."  </P> <P> Dickerson, bothered most of the season by a hamstring injury and frustrated to  the point that he has dropped hints about retirement, scored his first rushing  touchdowns in a month and tied Jim Brown for second place in NFL history with  the 58th 100-yard rushing game of his career. Trudeau completed 23 of 35 passes  for 195 yards.  </P> <P> Indianapolis led, 14-13, at halftime, then put the game out of reach with  third-quarter touchdowns by Dickerson on a one-yard run and James Pruitt on a  five-yard reception.  </P> <P> "As much as the offensive point production was encouraging, I still have to  (praise) the defense," Colt Coach Ron Meyer said.  </P> <P> The Dolphins rushed for only 41 yards and had three turnovers.  </P> <P> Fredd Young intercepted a pass by Miami's Dan Marino at the Dolphins' 28 on the  first series of the fourth quarter and seven plays later Trudeau passed six  yards to Albert Bentley for another touchdown, making it 35-13.  </P> <P> The Colts got the ball back 16 seconds later when Marino was sacked by Jon Hand  and fumbled at the Miami 18. Dickerson then ran four times, scoring from the  three to give the Colts their highest point production of the season.  </P></p>

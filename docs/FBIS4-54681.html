			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] An article in the 29 March issue of the  Warsaw daily ZYCIE WARSZAWY takes issue with U.S. criticism of  Polish arms sales to Burma because of that country's  human-rights practices. Journalist Marek Meissner writes that  Polish Government officials privately complain that Poland is  being singled out because it is more susceptible to U.S.  pressure than other arms-exporting countries and that a cutoff  of Polish military exports to Burma would only benefit the  Polish defense industry's foreign competitors. Meissner notes  that German, Portuguese, Korean, Chinese, and Indonesian  companies are currently exporting military hardware to Burma. He  alleges that even U.S. firms have sold "obsolescent" equipment  to Burma.    Meissner compares the current situation to an incident in  1991, when, as a result of U.S. pressure, Poland withdrew from  negotiations with Burma for a contract to supply several dozen  armed Mi-2 helicopters. The order subsequently went to China.  Meissner adds that, since then, U.S.-made Bell Model 212  helicopters have been sold to Burma.    Meissner also notes that the Polish Defense Ministry denies  that any large-scale transfer of weapons to Burma is taking  place. He quotes ministry spokesman Colonel Wieslaw Rozbicki as  saying that "none of the large companies such as Cenzin [a  state-owned arms-trading company] deliver materiel to Burma."  According to Rozbicki, what is at issue is "merely a small  amount of military equipment sold by a small firm."</p>

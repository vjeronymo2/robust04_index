			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / BT freezes managers' pay British Telecommunications will from April impose a pay freeze on 90 per cent of its 26,000 managerial staff. This follows the breakdown of negotiations with the managers' union, the Society of Telecom Executives. An estimated 1,000 BT managerial staff protested at the decision outside the company's headquarters in London yesterday. The union has called a delegate conference for March 10 to decide how to react. Mr Peter Archer, BT's employee relations director, said: 'We regret there has been no agreement. There was no meeting of minds. This is the first time we have ever gone ahead (in imposing pay) without making a deal.' The best-performing 10 per cent of managers will receive pay rises averaging 3 per cent with a maximum improvement of 6 per cent. BT estimates that 85 per cent (including the best performers) will next month receive one-off payments averaging 2.5 per cent or Pounds 800 - within a range of Pounds 300 to Pounds 1,940. Their pay levels will be frozen after April. About 4,000 managers - 15 per cent of the total - will not receive pay rises or one-off payments. The total cost will add an estimated 2.5 per cent to BT's annual pay bill. Mr Archer said the two sides had earlier come close to agreeing a deal. He said that was not possible because the union had insisted that all managers receive an increase consolidated into basic rates if possible. Last month BT decided to suspend a performance-pay scheme that started last year, on the grounds that it was paying managers too much. Mr Simon Petch, the union's general secretary, said: 'BT has shot itself in both feet. We have tried to rescue the company from its difficulties. It is true our members are well paid but they have played a big part in adding value to BT.' The union said it wanted whichever proved to be the greater of a 2.5 per cent rise or a percentage greater than the size of March's inflation figure. The company insists that it must bring the pay of its managerial and professional grades more into line with what it sees as market realities. BT executives argue that their managers are paid 11 per cent to 15 per cent more than others in similar jobs in comparable companies. BT said yesterday that 85 per cent of managers in the largest grade earned an average of Pounds 24,000 a year compared with Pounds 22,000 for their counterparts elsewhere. The company said its most detailed pay comparison showed that no other part of its 160,000 workforce was as well placed as its managers. Mr Petch said the union did not accept the findings of the survey and questioned the basis on which they were compiled.</p>

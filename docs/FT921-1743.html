			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Economics Notebook: Delicate art of balancing tax reforms IF THE past two weeks have demonstrated anything, it is that general elections in Britain are a poor breeding ground for sensible tax reform. Mr Norman Lamont's budget offended the tax reform lobby with its proposal for a 20p tax band for the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income. Mr John Smith's shadow budget for the opposition Labour Party last week was a mixture of good and bad. The three classic aims of tax reformers are to promote: economic efficiency fairness and administrative practicality. Labour's plans for a sharp increase in higher tax rates also raise the separate issue of how far they might affect the UK's economic performance. But first to Mr Lamont's budget. It was to be expected the 20p lower tax band would be badly received by enthusiastic reformers. The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, in particular, has campaigned for higher allowances rather than a reduced rate band on the grounds that the least well off are helped far more by being taken out of tax than by reducing the tax they pay. The lower tax band poses other problems. Low-income taxpayers who only pay the 20p tax rate but have savings in banks and building societies will have to claim back part of the 25 per cent basic rate of tax now deducted at source from their interest earnings. To cope with the change the Inland Revenue will have to hire an extra 800 staff. Mr Smith plans to increase the personal allowance by 10 per cent instead of the statutory 4.5 per cent in Mr Lamont's budget. His shadow budget would take 740,000 people out of tax at a cost of Pounds 920m against the Pounds 1.77bn cost of the government's lower tax band in 1992-93. Among other good ideas in the Labour package, the proposed removal of the 2 per cent employees' national insurance contribution (NIC) on earnings under Pounds 54 a week would remove one of the more crazy anomalies in the British tax and benefits system. At present, a person earning Pounds 54 a week pays no contribution, whereas someone earning Pounds 55 a week pays 2 per cent on his or her income, resulting in a marginal tax rate of 110 per cent. But Mr Smith's plans to extend the 9 per cent employees' NIC to all employees earning more than Pounds 405 a week and introduce a top 50 per cent tax band would almost certainly give new life to the tax avoidance industry, especially as Labour has no plans as yet to alter capital gains tax. Labour's plans to remove the upper-earnings limit for employees' NICs can be expected to boost payments in kind rather than cash, even though the shadow budget promises to extend employers' NICs to such perks. So long as Labour has no plans to add new capital gains tax rates to the present 25 per cent and 40 per cent rates - and a party official confirmed that this was the case last Friday - pressure would grow among middle managers to take income in the form of share options. Any capital gains from these would attract top tax rates of 40 per cent against the top 59 per cent levy to be placed on top incomes. Another curious effect of Mr Smith's plans, given Labour's history as the workers' party, would be that unearned income will be treated more favourably than earned income if Labour wins the election. Mr Smith dropped his original plan to extend the 9 per cent employee's NICs to interest and dividend income above Pounds 3,000 after a wave of protest from people who had recently been made redundant. Under Labour, the Duke of Westminster would therefore pay a marginal tax rate of 50 per cent on his unearned income while a not-so-affluent manager would lose 59 per cent in income tax and NICs from every pound earned above a taxable income of Pounds 36,375. Such developments would fly against the principle of tax neutrality, which has become the generally accepted goal of finance ministries in the big industrial countries over the past decade. Neutrality has as its objective a system that does not distort the workings of market forces or discriminate against specific groups. But would Labour's plans do more, and actually damage the UK economy? The Conservative Party says yes. It claims that by sharply increasing the effective top rate of tax from 40 per cent to 59 per cent at relatively low income levels, Labour would reduce incentives. The Tory manifesto reflects this view, declaring: 'Lower taxes have encouraged more people to work harder - not to spend their time working out how to avoid penal taxes.' This is an issue over which economists cannot agree. While supply-siders support the Conservative view, others argue that changes in tax rates can have little effect on how hard most people work because employees have little direct influence over their levels of output or their hours at work. There is more evidence that marginal tax rates have incentive or disincentive effects on so-called 'secondary workers', who are frequently married women doing part-time jobs. In so far as Mr Smith's Budget would hit the net income of heads of households, it might encourage their hitherto unemployed partners to seek work. On the other hand, there are likely to be some highly paid secondary workers - notably in the South East of England - for whom Labour's plans would act as a disincentive. The fact that Labour's planned 59 per cent top tax rate would bite at a relatively low income level makes any forecast of its effects difficult. The UK had a top rate of 60 per cent as recently as 1988. But when parliament approved that rate - in Mr Nigel Lawson's 1987 budget - it applied to taxable incomes worth more than Pounds 56,000 in today's money against Pounds 36,375 in Mr Smith's plan. By the standards of other industrialised democracies, Mr Smith's draft budget proposes tax increases of unusual severity for a significant minority of people. It is open to doubt whether such a radical tax change would be possible under forms of democracy other than Britain's first-past-the post, winner-take-all electoral system.</p>

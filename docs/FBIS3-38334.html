There was "apparently a problem because he is the fourth  general who has been `worn out' in former Yugoslavia by the  United Nations system," he said. "This system must be going  wrong somewhere."    Cot's withdrawal, at Butrus-Ghali's request, follows that of  French general Philippe Morillon and Belgian Francis Briquemont,  who in various ways criticized the UN's apparent impotence in  former Yugoslavia.    Juppe's comments were echoed by Defence Minister Francois  Leotard who said there was "a crisis" at the UN, adding that  France was planning to send the world body a memorandum  demanding to "determine the conditions of employment of French  forces" in Bosnia.    "If there is not a crisis between France and the UN, there  is  a crisis within the UN itself."    UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali arrived here late  Friday for a two-day private visit but diplomatic sources said  he could meet government officials during his stay.    Shortly after arriving from Amsterdam he met Georgian  President Eduard Shevardnadze who was ending an official visit  to France and who delayed his departure to meet the UN head.</p>

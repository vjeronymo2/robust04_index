			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg June 11 SAPA -- There could be  countrywide unrest in mines, after the accusation by black  mineworkers that white workers were hoisted to the surface  before them after a shift, the white Mineworkers' Union said on  Friday [10 June].    The union's general secretary, Mr Peet Ungerer, said that at  several mines, white workers had been threatened, assaulted and  prevented from going to work. He said the union rejected the  allegations of racism.    It had been the custom for many years for workers with  higher  grades to be hoisted to the surface first because they had to  discuss production reports with senior officials, he said.</p>

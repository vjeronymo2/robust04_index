			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Philippe Bernard: "French Nationality -- A New </F> User's Guide"]    [Text] The implementing decree of the 22 July law reforming  the law governing French nationality was published in the  JOURNAL OFFICIEL on Friday 31 December. It stipulates the  conditions under which the desire to become French will have to  be expressed in the future by some children of immigrants.  Another decree lays down the principle of the county courts and  district courts specializing in the issue of nationality.  Despite government promises, no national information campaign on  this sensitive subject has been planned.    How can somebody become French? Starting from 1 January  1994, the question will acquire a new angle for the tens of  thousands of young people born in France of foreign parents.  The start of the new year will also see the entry into force of  the entire reform of the nationality laws adopted in June 1993  after bitter debates. One part of this text has been in force  since last July. The decree, which has just been published  following an opinion by the Council of State, was signed by the  prime minister and the five other ministers concerned: the  ministers of justice, of the interior, of social affairs,  defense, and overseas territories and departments [DOM-TOM]. It  provides for specific new channels of access to French  nationality for the children of immigrants, which are decisive  for their integration.    What follows is the new user's guide to gaining French  nationality, as laid down by the new decree.  <H5>  Four Places to Express One's Desire To Be French </H5>   Young people born in France of two foreign parents born  abroad must henceforth show their desire to acquire French  nationality. This requirement only affects persons who will be  18 years old after 1 January 1994.    The new procedure applies between 16 and 21 years of age.  However, it is highly recommended to set things in motion  between the ages of 16 and 18, the period during which no  obstacle can be placed in the path of a young offender, whereas  after the age of 18 certain criminal convictions will prevent  the future acquisition of nationality. The procedure in  question is carried out simply and without any authorization  being required from the parents.    The decree empowers four authorities to receive the  expression of the desire to gain French nationality: civil  servants in all city halls (regardless of the place of residence  of the interested party); prefectorial departments (prefectures  and sub-prefectures); county judges; and the commanders of  gendarmerie brigades. The expression of this desire may be made  freely in writing, but pre-printed application forms will be  distributed in the relevant places and in schools. Educational  establishments, as well as police stations, may not process  applications themselves.    In the event, the four types of institution designated by  the  decree act merely as mailboxes. Whatever the circumstances,  they are bound to receive the young persons involved and give  them a dated official document attesting to their application.  The institutions must then pass on the document to the county  judge within three days. In the event of a rejection, summary  proceedings may be launched for faulty processing.    Although four authorities are competent to receive  expressions of the desire for French nationality, only one may  rule on the matter: the specialized county court judge (of whom  there are between two and four per department). This individual  does not have to rule on the appropriateness of the request, but  must merely verify that the conditions laid down by the law have  all been met. To this end, the judge involved asks the  applicants to provide the following official documents: their  birth certificate as proof of their birth in France; a  certificate of nonpunishment or of penalties incurred [issued by  the Ministry of Justice] (only for majors), and proof of their  habitual residence in France during the five years preceding the  request.    The latter proof may be provided in writing in any form:  school certificates, receipts for rent or electricity payments,  for example. The submission of these documents will be  officially acknowledged by the county court judge, who will then  have six months in which to submit his decision. Should the  judge fail to respond within this period, then the registration  of the nationality is considered to have been accepted. Once  the desire for French nationality has been recorded, the young  person in question may immediately obtain a certificate of  nationality and have an identity card issued.    In the event of a negative decision on the part of the  judge, the interested party may summon the attorney general  before the district court to have their French status  recognized. The same party may also launch a hierarchical  appeal against the judge's ruling before the minister of  justice. The decree states, exceptionally, that any minor aged  16 may institute these proceedings without receiving any  authorization from their parents.  <H5>  Limited Dual Nationality for Algerians </H5>   The new law abolishes the benefit of dual nationality for  the  children of persons born in former French colonies. By virtue  of this principle, which continued to apply until 31 December  1993, any child born in France of parents who were born in  former French territories (excluding Algeria) were born French.    The principle still applies if the parents were born in  Algeria before that country gained its independence. However, a  contested government amendment has introduced the requirement of  five years of regular residence in France by the parents as at  the time of the birth of their child. This provision -- which  breaks politically with the theory according to which Algeria  was a French department just like any other prior to 1962 --  will be the source of extreme administrative complications. In  effect, it will come down to requiring all the parents concerned  to provide documentary proof of five years of regular residence  in France.    The danger is that proof of this kind, though relatively  simple to provide at the time the child is born, could be  virtually impossible to verify when most of the parents  concerned are actually led to consider the question of the  nationality of their children at the age of adolescence, if not  when they come of age. Who will be able to prove, 18 years on,  that they previously resided in France on a regular basis? For  this reason, parents will be well advised to initiate  proceedings at the birth [of their child], demanding a  certificate of nationality from the county court judge.  <H5>  Information in Schools and High Schools </H5>   The extremely late publication of the decree has meant that  hardly any serious information could be circulated as yet. Some  rather unclear pamphlets have been distributed to the [relevant]  administrations, but nobody seems to know for sure whether they  have reached the people for whom they were intended.    Whereas the law was adopted six months ago, the decree  providing for an information mechanism is still not ready. When  it is, it will assign educational establishments, state national  insurance offices, welfare centers, and territorial authorities  a "duty to provide information." It would also have to provide  for the designation, in each school and high school of a  "correspondent on matters of nationality" who will serve as  middlemen between pupils of foreign origin and the  administrations concerned. The decree will also provide for the  modification of programs of civic education to include in them  some notions on the acquisition of French nationality. Finally,  a legal reference text should be distributed to the  administrations, associations, and media.    However, the "major national information campaign" promised  to members of parliament by Pierre Mehaignerie and Simone Veil  will doubtless never take place. The fear is that, in the  absence of information, young people will not take the steps  required to gain French nationality, or will allow the deadline  imposed by the law to pass. Radio broadcasts and televised  advertisements should attenuate this risk. So far no financing  has been freed up.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reports by Michael Evans: "Defence Cuts Force Closure of </F> Rosyth and RAF Bases"]    [Text] Ministers are bracing themselves for an announcement  next month that Rosyth naval base will be dosed, the RAF will  withdraw from Germany and the jobs of about 22,000 servicemen  and women will be lost.    The bulk of the job cuts, though not all through redundancy,  will fall on the RAF. RAF chiefs will have to accept wholesale  privatisation of many of its repair and maintenance units.    RAF manpower levels are expected to fall from 70,000 to  60,000 by the end of the decade. The only consolation for  departing RAF engineers and mechanics is that many of them are  expected to be recruited by commercial companies, who are likely  to win contracts to maintain frontline aircraft in place of the  RAF.    The latest round of defence cuts follows completion of the  study Frontline First, commissioned to prune all support  services to meet Treasury demand for a reduction in the budget  of 750 million pounds a year from 1996-97.    The most controversial item in next month's cuts will be the  closure of Rosyth, which employs 4,000 navy and 1,800 civilian  workers.    The RAF withdrawal from Germany may not be announced next  month, although the decision has been taken in principle,  subject to consultations with the Germans and Americans.    Gordon Brown, the shadow Chancellor, whose Dunfermline East  constituency contains Rosyth, said Labour and the unions would  vigorously oppose any attempt to close the naval base.    Malcolm Rifkind, the Defence Secretary, is still negotiating  with the Treasury about some aspects of the cuts package, which  will be announced on July 14. One point of disagreement is over  additional savings Mr Rifkind has managed to find during the  six-month study.    An extra 100 million pounds a year in savings has been  identified, over and above the 750 million pounds sought by the  Treasury, and Mr Rifkind wants to plough some of the money back  into training and increasing RAF pilots' flying time. However,  the Treasury insists that any remaining funds must be passed  back and made available for other government requirements.    Mr Rifkind will be summoned before the Commons Defence  Select  Committee during the summer recess to be questioned about the  cuts (Jill Sherman writes).    Sir Nicholas Bonsor, the committee's chairman, said the  civil  servants responsible for the 33 areas that have been under  scrutiny would also be called to give evidence. Sir Nicholas  said any attempt to cut the defence budget further next year  would be opposed by senior backbenchers.    Downing Street sources said Whitehall was "leaking left,  right and centre" and insisted that no decisions had been taken  about the defence cuts.</p>

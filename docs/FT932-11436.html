			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / UK Gilts: Most investors continue to take bearish view IT SEEMS a neat conclusion to pin the blame for last week's dive in the UK gilt market on a painful hangover after the Bank of England's Pounds 3bn auction of five-year stock. But two nagging doubts get in the way of this view. The first is the auction was not as bad as all that. The second is there were plenty of other much more serious reasons for the fall. The auction of 7 1/4 per cent bonds due 1998 was covered 1.77 times, which only looks weak in the light of some highly-optimistic estimates that it would be at least three times covered. More sober commentators stayed in the 1.5 to 2 range. A background of tight institutional cash-flow raises the question of where this hypothetical Pounds 9bn of cash would have come from for three times cover, especially as there was little reason to switch from UK equities to gilts. The answer was supposed to be: from overseas. But the evidence suggests foreign investors had come into the market ahead of the auction, benefiting from the strengthening of the pound from a low of DM2.32 in February. By Wednesday, the attraction of UK gilts had diminished. The pound had risen to about DM2.50 and a growing raft of upbeat economic news had doused hopes of further interest rate cuts and reawakened fears of inflation. This leads into the more serious concerns which increasingly undermined the market throughout April. At the beginning of the month, the June gilt futures contract hit a high level of 107.16. But by Thursday it had shed four points, reflecting general unease about the outlook for gilts. The market is refocusing on the sheer size and duration of the debt financing exercise. 'The age-old question is: who will buy Pounds 50bn of gilts?' said Mr John Shepperd, an economist at SG Warburg. He pointed out that the amount was roughly twice the estimated Pounds 25bn to Pounds 30bn of domestic institutional cash flow this year. If overseas investors were not active buyers of gilts, fears would be raised of a cash crunch, he said. To lure them in, yields - and yield spreads over the benchmark German bund - will probably have to go up. Mr Ifty Islam, an economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, predicted that the yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt would continue to rise from 8.1 per cent at the end of the week to 8.3 per cent in June. If this provided a gilt-bund yield spread of 150 basis points, it would attract overseas inflows. Currency movements were a crucial factor. 'When sterling was at DM2.32, a gilt-bund spread of 100 basis points would probably have been sufficient given the cheapness of the currency,' Mr Islam said. Apart from the supply headache, two other factors are bugging the market. The first is the string of good news on the economy. Last week, GDP figures showed non-oil growth of 0.6 per cent in the first quarter over the last quarter of 1992. Then the Confederation of British Industry reported a surge in business confidence to its highest level for 10 years. This came on top of previous upbeat headlines about unemployment and retail sales. This is seen as all but ruling out a further cut in the base rate from 6 per cent, although some economists feel this bearish assumption for the gilt market has been overdone. Worse still, it has reawakened fears in the fixed income market of inflation. As one marketmaker said: 'Can the government control the economy so that we can have non-inflationary, sustainable growth? The answer is no.' Not everyone agrees with that answer. But the question 'will it be different this time?' is a universal one. Those with a rosier view of the inflation outlook point to such comfort factors as high unemployment, lower earnings growth and under-used capacity. What emerged last week is that the bears have it for the time being. After the futures contract fell through its key support level at 104.30, a new floor of 102.1 was being suggested.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the disability claim manager will be responsible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the adjudication of an initial claim, the disability claim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manager will call in other staff resources, as necessary. With  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to disability decisionmaking, the disability claim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manager will, in appropriate circumstances, refer claims to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medical consultants to obtain expert advice and opinion. SSA will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> develop guidelines to assist the disability claim manager in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining when expert medical advice is appropriate. Similarly,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other staff resources will be called upon for technical support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in terms of certain claimant contacts and status reports;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of nondisability issues including auxiliary claims or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative payee issues; and payment effectuation. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the disability claim manager will make final decisions on both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the medical and nonmedical aspects of the disability claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Claimant Partnership  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Throughout the disability claim process, SSA will encourage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimants to be full partners in the processing of their claims.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many claimants are able to obtain the documentation necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> develop their record, either on their own or with the assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a third party. Others have substantial difficulty doing so,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and may have no third party to assist them. Given the range of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimant capabilities, SSA will retain ultimate responsibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for development of claims when claimants are not formally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To the extent that they are able, claimants and their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> families and other personal support networks will actively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate in the development of evidence to substantiate their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claim for disability benefits. SSA will provide assistance and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engage third-party resources, when necessary and appropriate. SSA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will keep claimants informed of the status of their claims,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advise claimants regarding what additional evidence may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary, and inform claimants what, if anything, they can do to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilitate the process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the completion of the claim intake interview, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability claim manager will issue a receipt to the claimant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that will identify what to expect from SSA and the anticipated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> timeframes. It will also identify what further evidence or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information the claimant has agreed to obtain. Finally, it will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide the name and telephone number of the disability claim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manager for any questions or comments which the claimant may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have, including any difficulty in obtaining the information the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimant agreed to obtain.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Third Parties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Certain third-party organizations may be willing to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a complete disability application package to SSA. Based on local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s assessment of service area needs and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> availability of qualified organizations, SSA will recognize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party organizations who are capable of providing a complete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application package, including appropriate application forms and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medical evidence necessary to adjudicate a disability claim. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such claims, SSA will permit the third party to identify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential claimants, screen for medical and nonmedical criteria,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and contact SSA to protect the filing date. The third party will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interview the claimant; complete all applications and related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forms; obtain completed treating source statements; and obtain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional medical evaluations, when appropriate. Using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures agreed on with local management, the third party will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submit claims for adjudication by a disability claim manager. SSA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will monitor such third parties to ensure that quality service is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided to claimants and to prevent fraud. SSA may establish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rules, standards, and procedures for third-party interaction with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimants and SSA. Third parties may be required to undergo  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periodic program, procedural or software training, and may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to meet standards for staffing and automation support.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In individual cases, disability claim managers may elect to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contact the claimant for the purpose of verifying identity or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other claim-related issues, as appropriate. SSA will also perform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ongoing document verification on a sample basis to assure the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> integrity of claims submitted by third parties. The automated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claim processing system will facilitate effective monitoring of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the claim-taking and evidence submission practices of third  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parties by permitting random and/or targeted selection of claim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> files involving specific third parties or specific types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Personal Interview With Claimant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When the evidence does not support an allowance, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability claim manager will issue a predecision notice advising  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the claimant of what evidence has been considered and providing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the opportunity to submit further evidence, if any, and/or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity for a personal interview within 10 calendar days. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> predecision notice will further advise the claimant that if he or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> she does not submit evidence or request a personal interview  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the 10 days, the claim will be decided based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence of record. If the claimant requests a personal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interview, the disability claim manager will conduct the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interview in person, by videoconference, or by telephone, as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability claim manager determines is appropriate under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances. In appropriate circumstances, this predecision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interview may be held concurrently with the initial intake  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interview. If the claimant identifies further available evidence,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the disability claim manager will advise the claimant to obtain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the evidence if the claimant is able to do so or, as necessary,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assist the claimant in obtaining it. The claimant will be advised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the specified timeframes for submitting additional evidence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In preparing the predecision notice, the disability claim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manager will rely on existing information available on-line as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part of the automated claim processing and decision support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system. As part of the evidence gathering process, the disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claim manager will have previously analyzed all the medical and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-medical information gathered, and entered the pertinent data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into the electronic claim record. The decision support system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will use the accumulated data in the electronic record to assist  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the disability claim manager in producing the predecision notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> ``Statement of the Claim''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The initial disability determination will use a statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the claim'' approach. The statement of the claim will set forth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the issues in the claim, the relevant facts, the evidence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered, including any evidence or information obtained as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result of the predecision notice, and the rationale in support of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the determination. The statement of the claim not only reflects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SSA <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s commitment to fully explaining the basis for its action but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also recognizes that claimants need clear information about the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis for the determination to make an informed decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding further appeal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As with the predecision notice, much of the information that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will provide the basis for the statement of the claim will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available on-line as part of the automated claim processing and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision support system. Adjudicators will create the statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the claim and whatever supplementary information is necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a legally sufficient notice to the claimant based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information in the decision support system. For allowance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decisions, the statement of the claim will be more abbreviated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than for denial decisions; however, it will contain sufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information to facilitate quality assurance reviews and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuing disability reviews. The statement of the claim will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part of the on-line claim record and will be available to other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjudicators as the basis and rationale for the Agency <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s action,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if the claimant seeks further administrative review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In making initial disability determinations, disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claim managers will rely on standards for decisionmaking that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used at all levels of the process. SSA will develop a single  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presentation of all substantive policies used in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination of eligibility for benefits and all decisionmakers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be bound by these same policies. These policies will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Expert systems will be developed to facilitate the development  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and delivery of disability policy as an integrated part of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> automated claim processing system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Disability Decision Methodology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Promoting Consistent, Equitable, and Timely Decisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

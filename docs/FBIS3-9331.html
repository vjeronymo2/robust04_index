"But we will only be able to make  a definitive assessment after 1995 when the transformation will  be completed," he told CTK after he visited the army's General  Staff.    Defense Minister Antonin Baudys said that the largest amount  of work was awaiting the army this year and in the first half of  1995.    Havel said he was very pleased "to hear now, when the Dutch  queen is visiting the Czech Republic, a report about the very  successful joint exercise with a Dutch unit, the first ever  exercise with a Western army on our soil." The exercise started  in mid-March and is to finish on March 24.</p>

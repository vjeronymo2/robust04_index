			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Buthelezi gets home affairs portfolio Mr Nelson Mandela, South Africa's new president, yesterday named Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, his main black political rival, to an influential post in his government of national unity. The move lends substance to the call for political reconciliation he made at his inauguration on Tuesday. Chief Buthelezi accepted the post of home affairs minister, a portfolio which is likely to give him authority over a large part of the civil service. However, control over the country's police force and other security services has been retained by Mr Mandela's African National Congress, which would also be expected to monitor closely the chief's ministerial decision - making. The appointment of Chief Buthelezi is one of three full ministerial positions allocated to his Inkatha Freedom party, which decided to participate in South Africa's first all-race elections only 10 days before polling started last month. The other two Inaktha portfolios will be arts and sciences, and correctional services. Under the country's interim constitution agreed after multi-party talks last year in which Chief Buthelezi did not participate, all parties which won more than 5 per cent of the vote were entitled to cabinet representation. Cabinet posts yesterday also went to six members of the new parliament from the National party of Mr F W de Klerk, who will serve as second vice-president. As expected, the respected Mr Derek Keys retains the finance ministry, a decision on which local equity and currency markets had been counting. His deputy will be Mr Alec Erwin, an influential white economist in the ANC who has been closely associated with the party's planned reconstruction and development programme. Mr Pik Botha, the veteran foreign minister, moves to mineral and energy affairs following the appointment last Friday of Mr Alfred Nzo to his former post. Mr Roelf Meyer, the National party's chief negotiator in the tortuous constitutional talks, becomes minister for provincial affairs and constitutional development. One surprise appointment was that of Mrs Winnie Mandela, President Mandela's estranged wife who is head of the ANC's Women's League and has a strong following among radical ANC youth. Mrs Mandela becomes deputy minister for the arts and sciences. Another was the choice as deputy environment minister of General Bantu Holomisa, military ruler of the disbanded Transkei 'homeland' where he retains a power base among the rural poor. Although neither portfolio in itself carries much power, the appointments are seen as an attempt to prevent the two from becoming destabilising forces within the party. However, one of Mrs Mandela's allies, Mr Peter Mokaba, former leader of the ANC youth league who had been widely tipped to be given the tourism portfolio, was left out of the cabinet. Instead that job will go to Mr Trevor Manuel in addition to his previously announced responsibilities as trade and industry minister.</p>

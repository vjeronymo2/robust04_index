			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Gonzalez aide held in probe One of the shadowiest episodes of the period in office of Mr Felipe Gonzalez', the Spanish prime minister, is expected to be unravelled following the arrest of a senior member of the governing Socialist party in connection with a right-wing death squad that waged an undercover war against Basque separatists in the 1980s. Ms Margarita Robles, the interior ministry's secretary of state, told the Madrid parliament yesterday that a high court judge had ordered the arrest of Mr Julian Sancristobal, a senior government official in the Basque Country between 1982 and 1984, director general of state security between 1984 and 1986 and subsequently a member of the Socialist party's policy council. Ms Robles said the arrest of Mr Sancristobal, together with three police officers, had been ordered by Judge Baltasar Garzon on charges of attempted murder, kidnapping and misuse of public funds. Mr Mario Conde, the former chairman of Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), who was indicted on fraud charges last month, was interrogated yesterday by a Madrid investigating judge. The questioning, which centres on the collapse a year ago of Banesto, then the fourth-ranked Spanish bank continued late into the night and is expected to continue today.</p>

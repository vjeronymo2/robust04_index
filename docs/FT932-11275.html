			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Arts: AIDS Quilt Songbook in San Francisco - Concert When the American baritone William Parker found his career, as well as his body, ravaged by the Aids virus, he again turned to song and conceived the idea for The AIDS Quilt Songbook. He commissioned from leading composers and poets a still-growing collection of songs that, like the panels in the Names Project quilt, remember individuals who have died of Aids. Like the quilt's panels, the Songbook songs are performed in whatever configuration best suits an occasion. The 16 songs recently performed during the San Francisco Symphony's 'Wet Ink' new-music festival turned out to be, among other things, a memorial for Parker himself, who died in New York on March 29 at the age of 49. The musically exemplary performances by the baritones Kurt Ollmann, David Evitts, and Andrew Solomon-Glover were unified by the deeply sympathetic piano playing of William Huckaby, an associate of the project from its inception. The songs (soon to be published by Boosey and Hawkes) ranged from the sweetly elegiac (Ned Rorem's 'A Dream of Nightingales') to the ragingly defiant (Donald Wheelock's 'Fury'). While each poem and its setting captured an aspect of grief, some inevitably left longer echoes in memory. Solomon-Glover intoned John Harbison's 'The Flute of Interior Time' in a rapt hush. Ollmann, who captured the specific consolation in Thom Gunn's 'The Reassurance' (set by Donald St. Pierre), carefully traced the thread of a Chinese proverb embedded in the Ron Schreiber text of Carl Byron's 'the birds of sorrow.' Evitts masterfully delineated the desultory undertow in William Bolcom's bluesy 'Vaslav's Song' and kept listeners hanging on the heartbreaking narrative of Lee Hoiby's 'Investiture at Cecconi's' Throughout, the powerful texts told, even across difficult musical idioms. Sad lines, like 'Paul Jacobs is playing Busoni on the radio' (from Chris De Blasio's 'An Elegy to Paul Jacobs') were wrenching. Yet the most memorable words were the hard ones, like the rapier word-play of poet Charles Barber's 'Death be nimble - life was quick' in St Pierre's 'Fairy Book Lines.' Even a San Francisco concert audience was pommelled by poet Melvin Dixon's tough talk - 'Night sweats. Dry cough/Loose stools. Weight loss.' rendered with uncomprom- ising force by Evitts. The music was deeply personal. If some of it seemed less than external, it bears remembering that no one wanted to have to write this music, and that the participants would like nothing more than for this music to become unnecessary and obsolete.</p>

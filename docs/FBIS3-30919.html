Zakrzewski added that the president signed Borowski's  resignation "in accordance with the procedures."    "According to the president, what happened is the internal  matter of the coalition and the government; the matter of  observing the agreements and following the procedure of changes  in the cabinet. The president has nothing to do with it, and he  can only accept the changes, and this is what he did,"  Zakrzewski said.    Asked whether he does not think that the president accepted  Borowski's resignation unexpectedly quickly, Zakrzewski replied:  "The president is always quick."</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Ghost of Christmas Past hovers over UK market - Market Report Share traders in London held their fire for much of yesterday as they awaited next week's political developments. As a result, the traditional 'Friday feeling' contained more than its usual quota of torpor. But recovery on Wall Street and some bullish comments from one of the UK's leading securities houses were enough to raise the ghost of Christmas Past. From being 22 points down at one stage the FT-SE 100 closed only 3.1 lower at 3,033.5. However, that still reflected a fall of almost 100 points on the week. In tandem, the second-line stocks represented by the FT-SE mid 250 Index ended the day down 0.9 at 3,480.3. With the US markets closed on Thursday and thus offering no direction, the first part of the day was soggy. The FT-SE 100 opened more than seven points down as few investors were prepared to commit themselves ahead of the Tory vote on the European finance bill scheduled for Monday - a vote of confidence in the government - and the Budget on Tuesday. What many saw as the 'dead cat' bounce of the previous day unwound itself. Much of the early activity reflected so-called bed and breakfast deals. These large tax-related trades have been evident in the run-up to the Budget, fuelled by fears that the Chancellor may end a practice many see as nothing more than a tax loophole. The market hit a low of 3,014 as economists examined the latest survey of economic trends published by the Confederation of British Industry. Although the survey argued that growth would slow because of increased taxes, it recorded an increase in manufacturers expecting domestic price increases and revived rate rise worries. Then, Wall Street opened strongly leading to recovery in the bond markets and dragging the stock market higher. Footsie futures also moved from a small discount to the cash market to a small premium. By the time London closed, Wall Street was showing a 30-point gain. Business also picked up late in the day with turnover reaching 587.6m shares against 577.1m on Thursday. Nevertheless, much of it represented marketmakers tweaking their books and genuine customer or retail business was not expected to be significant. Retail business on Thursday stood at Pounds 1.3bn. Another element nudging equities forward was a bullish economic forecast from SG Warburg. The securities house raised its estimate for growth in 1995 to 4.5 per cent from 3.8 per cent previously. The figure is at the top of the range of economic forecasts and, while it might appear to herald interest rate palpitations, it was combined with an argument that inflation will remain comparatively low. Coming on the heels of a change of heart from UBS earlier in the week the review suggested that pre-Christmas cheer for the London market might be making an appearance. Mr Ian Harnett, economist with Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, commented: 'Just before the Budget last year the market stood at 3,067 and our forecast of 3,250 looked demanding. But by the end of Christmas the Footsie had rallied to 3,418.' A great deal will depend on the government's Public Sector Borrowing Requirement which will be revealed during the Budget. If that is substantially reduced it could prompt an investment rush. And if growth is the buzz word then equities could benefit at the expense of government bonds. Market features were scarce although the acknowledgment by the Halifax Building Society that it was in talks with Leeds Permanent shook up the banking sector. And expectation continued that GEC would make an increased bid for the submarine maker VSEL.</p>

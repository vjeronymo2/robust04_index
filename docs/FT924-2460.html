			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Housing cut plan angers associations HOUSING associations reacted with fury last night to a leaked paper that proposes a steep reduction in the number of associations receiving government grants to build homes for rent. The paper, leaked to Housing Associations Weekly, was drawn up by the Housing Corporation, the quango that distributes the grants. It recommends cutting the number of associations receiving grants from more than 560 to 87, with another 46 included if their finances improved sufficiently. The Housing Corporation acknowledged yesterday that it was examining a range of policy options to ensure 'the efficient and effective delivery of social housing'. Even so, Mr Anthony Mayer, chief executive of the corporation, said that did not 'imply that a particular policy has been determined or adopted'. The Housing Corporation paper was drawn up after the chancellor announced cuts in funding for housing associations in the Autumn Statement last month. The grant paid to associations for building inexpensive housing will fall from 75 per cent of costs this year to 67 per cent next year and to 55 per cent by 1995. That will force housing associations to borrow more of the cost of new homes on the capital markets. The number of lenders in the market is described by the paper as 'disappointingly low', with enthusiasm in the City for housing association bond issues having 'quickly evaporated'. The Housing Corporation paper says that government grants should be restricted to high-performing associations that can borrow on the 'finest terms'. It also says that such a move would protect public funds invested in associations, which will face increasing financial pressure after the reduction in grant. Financial ratios developed in consultation with Hambros Bank put 87 associations in division one, fully eligible for funding. Another 46 fall into division two, needing to improve to continue receiving grant. Mr Jim Coulter, director of the National Federation of Housing Associations, immediately called for the paper to be withdrawn. Ms Sheila Button, who chairs the Metropolitan Housing Trust, said the government appeared to be second-guessing the capital markets. 'The market is developing and we haven't had any trouble raising money,' she said.</p>

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Attack pressed on Bihac Moslem rebel forces backed by Serbs yesterday pressed forward in the northwestern Bosnian enclave around the town of Bihac, with the United Nations threatening to call in air strikes if the town itself was attacked. Forces loyal to renegade leader Fikret Abdic were reported to be closing in on the UN-designated safe area, as Bosnian Serb forces came within 2km of the town. Meanwhile, two people were wounded in a missile attack on Sarajevo, prompting the UN to call in Nato fighters to buzz the capital. 'Any attack on the safe area of Bihac would inevitably result in the use of Nato air power,' said Mr Paul Risley, UN spokesman. But a defiant Bosnian Serb commander General Manojlo Milovanovic promised to attack if the Bosnian fifth corps withdrew into the town. Mr Abdic's forces crossed into the Bihac pocket on Wednesday from Serb-held territory in Croatia in a push bolstered by Serb troops and heavy artillery from Krajina, their self-styled state in Croatia.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Australia has said it has no intention of  replacing the United States in providing military assistance to  Indonesia.    The Australian ambassador to Indonesia, Allan Taylor, said  the recent visit to Australia by Indonesia's Army Chief General  Wismoyo Arismunandar had nothing to do with the so-called effort  on Australia's part to replace the U.S. as a military aid donor  to Indonesia.    Last year, the U.S. cut its military aid program to  Indonesia  following allegations that Jakarta had committed violations of  human rights in East Timor. [passage omitted]    Mr. Taylor said that, as far as Australia was concerned, the  U.S. military involvement in Asia was important mainly because  it could help generate economic growth in the region.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The leader of PANPRA [National, Progressive  Revolutionary Party of Haiti] Serge Gilles reiterated his  opposition to the worsening of the sanctions against Haiti.    Serge Gilles today expressed opposition to the sanctions on  Haiti in the form of a total embargo, said that he considered it  an erroneous approach by the international community that will  only aggravate the sufferings of the people. In a statement to  the Agence France-Presse, Gilles pointed out that based on what  he saw within the country, the suffering of the people was  increasing dramatically.    The embargo did not create the structural misery in Haiti,  he  said, but it has multiplied this misery six or seven times. The  increase in the rate of child mortality and the destruction of  production capacity are palpable facts, Serge Gilles pointed  out, adding that those who are motivated by those sanctions are  doing well at the expense of the people. Mr. Gilles advocated  the search for a consensus through a national conference,  excluding no one, with a view toward forming first a government  of national concord.    It should be recalled, according to some independent  humanitarian religious sources, that the embargo against Haiti,  imposed in October 1991, has caused the deaths of more than  10,000 people in vulnerable groups, mostly children and the  elderly.</p>

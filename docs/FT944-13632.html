			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Hamilton linked to companies probed by SFO Mr Neil Hamilton, who resigned as corporate affairs minister on Tuesday, was a director of a company linked to a group of companies investigated by the Serious Fraud Office. A colleague of Mr Hamilton said yesterday that Downing Street was likely to have been made aware of the SFO probe and that this may have contributed to Mr John Major's decision to ask him to resign. There is no suggestion that Mr Hamilton himself has been investigated. 'The disclosure would have been particularly embarrassing to him, given that he is corporate affairs minister at the DTI,' said a Conservative colleague. From January 17 to September 30 1990, Mr Hamilton was a director of Plateau Mining, a gold mining company. Plateau had previously been owned by Robertson Group, the mining consultancy, whose activities have been examined by the SFO as part of its probe into natural resource companies connected to Midlands entrepreneur Mr Clive Smith. Mr Hamilton joined Plateau's board when Robertson floated the company on the Stock Exchange. He resigned when he joined the government as a whip. Plateau's shares came to market at a price of 90p, valuing the group at Pounds 16.8m. In August 1992, Plateau's shares were suspended at 3p and eight months later it was taken over at 6p a share. The SFO is investigating the flotations of Butte Mining and Richmond Oil and Gas. When Butte bought properties in 1988, Robertson appraised the assets and after the acquisition had a 14.9 per cent holding in Butte. On Tuesday, Mr Hamilton was told at a meeting with Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary, and Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, that allegations had been sent to Downing Street relating to Plateau. Mr Heseltine and Mr Ryder told him they felt his ability to carry out his duties would be impaired by the need to answer these allegations and others.</p>

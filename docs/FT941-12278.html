			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / The Markets: The last picture show, perhaps - Global Investor A grim-faced, bearded soothsayer tramps through the streets of New York holding aloft a placard declaring that 'the end of the sale of Paramount is near.' The cartoon, published in New Yorker magazine, sums up both Wall Street's weariness with the five-month-old battle for entertainment group Paramount Communications, and the gloomy expectation that whichever bidder wins the contest will turn out to be the loser - at least in the short run. Over the past few months the market has hammered the shares of each of the two bidders - Viacom and QVC Network - when they appeared to be the likely victor, and analysts expect this movement to be accentuated when the contest is finally settled. That could be as early as this week. The Paramount board has set tomorrow as the deadline for best and final offers, and it issued a stern warning last week that bids beyond February 1 would violate the ground rules it has laid down for the contest. Shareholders will have until the middle of the month to make their choice. However, since the board has a duty to get the best value for stockholders - and may face investor suits if it does not - it could find it hard to ignore a higher offer made after the auction gavel has supposedly dropped for the third time. The winner's shares are expected to drop in part because much of Paramount's stock is now in the hands of Wall Street arbitrageurs, rather than long-term investors, and they will be keen to liquidate quickly the holdings in the victor's stock which they receive in part-payment for their Paramount shares. At the same time, whichever company wins Paramount will be leveraging itself up with debt in order to pay a very high price - more than 17.5 times operating cash flow in the year to April and a price/earnings multiple of over 40 - for a business with a lacklustre profits record, forecast to produce flat earnings this year. Viacom says Wall Street is 'grossly underestimating' the growth potential of its merger with Paramount, and the simultaneous takeover it is planning of video retailer Blockbuster Entertainment. The company certainly has an impressive record in the creation of branded television programming. But Paramount's core business is its film studio, and the track record of QVC's Barry Diller, one of the most creative Hollywood figures of the past two decades, suggests he is more likely to make this asset hum - eventually. Disney Whatever the outcome, the Paramount bidders are gambling that entertainment software assets - film and television shows - will have a high scarcity value in the brave new world of inter-active, multi-media communications, which promises to bring a host of new television-based services into the home, ranging from shopping to video telephony. No one really knows how much of this consumers will be willing to pay for, or when, and fortunes are going to be won and lost finding out. But it is a fair bet that movies and TV shows which can be summoned on demand, by the flick of a remote control button, will be among the most popular offerings. With Paramount about to lose its independence, the only remaining large, quoted and fairly 'pure' film business is Walt Disney, which last week produced a remarkably strong set of first quarter figures, with net income rising 34 per cent to Dollars 368.6m. Disney shares have been held back by the crisis at its 49 per cent-owned associate, Euro Disney, which is crippled with debt and is about to start negotiations with its banks over an emergency refinancing. Last week's figures excluded Euro Disney losses because Walt Disney has written its investment down to zero. But the Euro Disney crisis will eventually pass, be it through a debt restructuring or closure, and the recent emergence of a secondary market in Euro Disney debt is one positive straw in the wind. Euro Disney aside, the basic business fundamentals at Walt Disney look strong, a fact which may have escaped European investors, perhaps enjoying a touch of schadenfreude at America's most powerful purveyor of popular culture fouling up in the old world. Walt Disney's American theme park business may be growing only modestly, but its film division produced a 45 per cent surge in first quarter operating profits to Dollars 340m, thanks largely to two animated films: Aladdin, which was released in video form in the US market and in cinemas internationally; and the Jungle Book, an older Disney title which was released internationally in video. There is plenty more in the cartoon pipeline, with the release in the US next summer of Lion King, an African wildlife tale with music by Elton John, followed next Christmas by Pocahontas, an American Indian saga. Jessica Reif, of Oppenheimer &amp; Co, who has been one of the most bullish Wall Street analysts on Disney and thinks the stock could rise 30 per cent over the next 12 months, says the success of the Jungle Book underlines a unique feature about the company. Disney can 're-release each animated film every seven to ten years and do as well or better than the original release.' That is not true for live action films, and makes its library the most valuable in Hollywood on a per-title basis. The Fed's dilemma The US Federal Reserve's policy-making Open Market Committee will meet on Thursday and Friday of this week to address the question uppermost in the mind of the global financial community: when will the Fed tighten monetary policy, implementing the first US interest rate increase in five years? Most Wall Street analysts expect the central bank to nudge rates higher  - possibly taking the Fed funds rate from 3 per cent to 3.25 per cent - over the next few months, to nip incipient inflation in the bud and reassure the bond market as the US economy's growth accelerates . Yet at the moment inflation does not seem a problem. Last Friday's figures for fourth quarter GDP - showing the economy growing at an annual rate of 5.9 per cent - also contained good inflation news. The implicit GDP deflator, a broad measure of price changes and shifts in buying patterns, rose just 1.3 per cent in the quarter, compared to the 3 per cent forecast by some analysts. The fourth quarter growth rate was boosted by special factors and Wall Street is expecting a sharp drop in the first three months of this year, particularly in view of severe winter storms in the East and the earthquake in Los Angeles (though some economists argue that the quake could be a net plus for growth, given the construction spending it will trigger). The Wall Street concensus for 1994 as a whole is growth of a little over 3 per cent. The FOMC, in this week's first meeting of the year, will form its own view on the outlook for 1994, as well as setting monetary growth targets. As it considers tightening it will have one more piece of statistical evidence to weigh - January's employment report, due out on Friday morning, which is expected to show a gradually expanding labour market, though the picture may be distorted by seasonal factors and changes in reporting methodology. The committee faces a dilemma. It needs to firm before inflation becomes an evident problem, because by then a price spiral will be embedded in the system and the harsh medicine necessary to stop it would severely unsettle the markets. On the other hand, last week's bond market rally indicates that Wall Street remains relaxed about inflation, while an early rise in rates would be politically unpopular (particularly against a background of natural disasters) at a time when Congress is threatening to curb the Fed's freedom. In a week when the US is basking in the best of all possible Panglossian worlds - solid growth and low inflation - the Fed would be brave indeed to break the spell.  ----------------------------------------------------------------         TOTAL RETURN IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO  27/1/94  ----------------------------------------------------------------                    per cent change over period             US   Japan   Germany   France   Italy     UK  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Cash  ----------------------------------------------------------------  Week     0.06    0.04      0.12     0.13    0.16   0.10  Month    0.27    0.20      0.55     0.56    0.71   0.45  Year     3.69    3.34      7.50     9.69   11.94   5.88  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year  ----------------------------------------------------------------  Week     0.07   -0.12     -0.04    -0.07    0.06  -0.18  Month    0.74   -1.63      0.16     0.24    0.73   0.18  Year     8.09    8.38     11.98    17.12   25.30  11.37  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year  ----------------------------------------------------------------  Week     0.12   -0.99     -0.26    -0.41   -0.18  -0.74  Month    0.77   -3.21     -0.31     0.11    0.49  -0.29  Year    11.90   10.13     15.13    21.96   35.88  19.25  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Equities  ----------------------------------------------------------------  Week    -0.3    -0.9       0.1      1.0     3.8   -0.9  Month    0.7     8.9      -5.3      1.8     2.9    2.2  Year    10.4    23.2      36.6     37.8    39.7   28.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------       BEST PERFORMING STOCKS FROM FT-A WORLD INDICES            IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO  27/1/94  -------------------------------------------------------------------                                  per cent change                            Close   Week   Month   Year  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Jennings Group (Aus)        0.39   45.5   45.5   300.0 Ferruzzi Fin.

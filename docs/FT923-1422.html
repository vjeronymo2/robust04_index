			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Accountant admits BCCI paper leak AN ACCOUNTANT working on the Serious Fraud Office's investigation into the collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International leaked a highly confidential document to make money by insider dealing, an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday. Mr Mark Braley, who had been seconded from Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte for the BCCI probe, admitted supplying a paper relating to Control Securities, a company central to the SFO's investigation, to his co-defendant Mr Bernard Lynch, a freelance accountant. Mr Braley agreed this had been 'thoroughly wrong', but denied that he had ever intended to undermine the SFO's investigation by leaking the document. He and Mr Lynch both deny conspiring to pervert the course of justice by interfering with SFO files and passing on information relating to the inquiry. The paper, which outlined the SFO's lines of inquiry into the company, was the most sensitive material available to him and he was prepared to leak it for financial gain, Mr Braley told his counsel, Mr Vivien Robinson QC. However, he was unaware Mr Lynch would make the paper available to The Times newspaper. When, subsequently, Mr Braley took part in the raid on the offices of Control Securities, he felt 'absolutely sick', he said. He had not intended to prejudice the SFO investigation, he told Mr Robinson. When he made an offer to Mr Michael Barrett, a solicitor acting for Mr Syed Akbar, a former BCCI official arrested in connection with the SFO inquiry, to 'contaminate' and 'deface' evidence, that had not been his intention but part of a bluff, he said. He had thought Mr Lynch, who had made contact with Mr Barrett, was working for the SFO on a 'sting' operation to catch the solicitor. Mr Braley was questioned by Mr Timothy Langdale QC, prosecuting, as to why, in discussing BCCI at all with Mr Lynch, he had broken specific orders from his SFO superiors not to discuss the inquiry with anyone outside the inquiry team. He had thought that was part of his job as an investigator, Mr Braley replied. Mrs Barbara Mills QC, then the SFO director, had asked staff to carry out more informal interviews, since too many had been carried out using the SFO's Section 2 powers, which compel interviewees to give evidence. He had thought from that that talking to Mr Lynch was acceptable, but now agreed he had been 'very wrong', he told the court. The trial continues today.</p>

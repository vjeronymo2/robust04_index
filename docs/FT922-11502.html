			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Government Bonds: Surge in money supply casts cloud over German bonds A SURPRISE leap in the German money supply hit German government bond prices yesterday and sent reverberations around other European bond markets. The message from March's 9.7 per cent leap in German M3 was simple: any hopes for interest rate cuts in Europe will have to be put on hold for some while yet. The growth rate was well up on the 8.6 per cent of the previous month, and far outside the Bundesbank's stated target range. The news may have killed hopes of an early German rate cut, but failed to arouse fears that the Bundesbank would move to raise rates in the near future. A further slight tightening of German monetary policy had been signalled on Wednesday, when at its weekly repurchase auction the Bundesbank had set a minimum rate of 9.6 per cent, up five basis points from last week. But yesterday's Bundesbank meeting passed without any change in the official stance. Coming after a quiet day's trading, the news led to a flurry of activity on the futures market, with the Liffe contract falling from its opening of 87.89 to 87.34 by the end of the day. The benchmark unity bond maturing in 2002 fell from 100.49 at lunchtime to 100.1 in late trading, pushing the yield up to 8 per cent. THE French government bond market, which had been looking for a cut in interest rates, reacted worse than most to the news from Germany, with the move to shorter-dated securities of recent days being partially reversed. The yield on 10-year OATs jumped five basis points to 8.71 per cent, keeping the spread between French and German markets at over 70 basis points. THE UK government bond market, which in recent days has come to believe that an interest rate cut is still some way off, reacted less sharply to the German monetary position. Shorter-dated paper moved less than in other markets, with the benchmark 10 per cent bonds due 1994 losing only  5/32 to 100 27/32 , for a yield of 9.53 per cent. Meanwhile, longer-dated paper suffered losses of around half a point. The 9 per cent bonds due 2011 fell to 99 5/32 , a yield of 9.09 per cent, while the yield on ten-year bonds rose to 9.22 per cent. US Treasury prices were narrowly mixed yesterday afternoon after moving lower in the morning following a drop in initial jobless claims and a bigger than expected increase in March durable goods orders. Treasuries moved off their lows of the day following the five-year note auction and the afternoon release of an unexpected drop in domestic car sales for mid-April. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was 7/32 lower at 99 13/32 , yielding 8.05 per cent after falling about 5/8 point earlier in the day. The two-year note was  1/32 higher to yield 5.39 per cent. The Federal Reserve refrained from operating in the open market during the morning. Fed funds, the rate at which banks lend to each other, were trading at 3 5/8 per cent during the Fed's usual intervention period. Selling started earlier in the day on the back of a report that initial jobless claims had fallen 12,000 in the week ended April 11. The decline was the third in a row and sparked fears that April's employment report might show an improvement. In addition, March durable goods orders rose by 1.6 per cent, slightly above the 1 per cent increase the market had expected. The market was also concerned about supply ahead of the afternoon's auction of Dollars 10.25bn of five-year notes. The auction went reasonably well, with an average yield of 6.93 per cent. SWEDEN'S government bond market saw a sharp rise in yields yesterday morning on fears of an unexpectedly high budget deficit for 1992. According to Swedish press reports, the government will forecast a budget deficit of SKr111bn for 1992 when it presents its supplementary budget today, well above analysts' expectations and nearly double the 1991 figure of SKr61.6bn. Traders said there was a marked sell-off when the bond market opened. The five-year benchmark bond, the 10.75 per cent bond due January 23 1997, moved to a closing yield of 9.97 per cent, compared with 9.85 per cent on Wednesday. However, bond prices picked up slightly in after-hours trading on unconfirmed reports that the Swedish central bank wants the Swedish krona to fluctuate by no more than 2.25 per cent against the currencies in the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European monetary system. The Swedish krona is already tied to the Ecu, but there has been speculation in recent months about closer links. Traders said the news was seen as positive for the Swedish government bond market as it would mean more stability for the currency and would help to reduce the large swings in capital movement in and out of Sweden.</p>

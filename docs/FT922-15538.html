			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / World Trade News: Renault keeps faith with its plans in Slovenia WARS do not sell cars, as Mr Bernard Coursat, the general director of Revoz, in which Renault holds the majority stake, is realising. Nevertheless, the large, modern plant in Novo Mesto, an hour's drive from Ljubljana, the Slovene capital, continues to increase production with the expectation that exports to France, which account for 65 per cent of total sales, will remain steady, and exports to the former Yugoslavia will pick up. The figures for the latter market are far from encouraging. Since last October, when the civil war in neighbouring Croatia was at its worst, a total of 2,500 cars were told to Serbia, the biggest of the Yugoslav republics. Renault sold 200 cars, and Volkswagen, which has a plant in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina, sold 1,000 vehicles to a republic which has a population of over 8.5m. 'This is serious,' said Mr Coursat. Transport and communications difficulties in Yugoslavia have also affected sales. Despite this, Renault will assemble the Clio, successor to the Renault 5, at its plant in Novo Mesto. Having already invested FFr800m (Pounds 82.5m) in the project, Renault remains committed to boosting production and sales. In 1989, a year after Renault formed Revoz - a joint venture with IMV, the Slovene state-owned engineering and vehicle manufacturing plant which had been transformed into a stock-holding company - Renault was producing 47,500 units, consisting of the Renault 4 and 5 models. The figure increased to 67,915 in 1990, and to 74,976 in 1991. Mr Anton Repovs, production head at the plant, said assembly of the Clio would push up annual production to 75,000. Daily productivity is set to increase from 360 units to 450 units. Renault, which first started assembling cars in Slovenia 18 years ago and which recently increased its stake in Revoz to 54 per cent, believes low labour costs among a skilled-labour force provides the main incentive for assembling the Clio in Slovenia. The wage bills are between four and five times lower than in France. Renault also has close links with Ljubljanska Banka, which holds a monopoly in the banking sector and which holds 26 per cent of IMV's 46 per cent stake in Revoz. Cheap labour bills and good financial connections apart, Mr Coursat remains preoccupied with regaining the markets of the former Yugoslavia. He has little choice. The Slovene market, which normally accounts for 10 per cent of total annual car sales to Yugoslavia, remains too small for Renault - Slovenia has a population of 2m. Renault already holds 48 per cent of the republic's car market, and 10 per cent of the Yugoslav market. 'We have to do everything to regain our market share, and increase it, in the former Yugoslavia,' said Mr Repovs. 'This market, and the markets in south-eastern Europe, are potentially huge. Already we have set up bilateral contracts with the republics of Macedonia and Bosnia-Hercegovina to sell cars. We have no choice but to keep expanding in this part of Europe.'</p>

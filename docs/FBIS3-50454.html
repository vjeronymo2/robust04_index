			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "TV Today" newscast] </F>   [Text] The U.S. Government gave the Colombian Government  $700 million to allow 122 U.S. Marines to build a school and  health center in Juanchaco in southwest Valle del Cauca. That  sum is equivalent to 56 billion pesos and seems an astronomical  amount for the two projects. If the Marines' presence in  Colombia is not approved, the government would have to return  the money.    Right now there is only confusion, mystery, and absolute  silence toward the media at the port in Malaga Bay. These  vessels, aboard which the 122 U.S. Southern Command engineers,  materials, and military trucks arrived, are the only words.  Everything here has come from the United States. The U.S.  flags flying on the vessels speak for themselves, because  neither the gringos nor Colombian military are willing to  explain anything on camera. They say the whole matter is being  handled by the Defense Ministry.    The "TV Today" newscast was able to contact the gringo team  leader, who told us that Colombia should be proud to have this  great assistance from his country. For them, this mission,  during which a school and a health center are allegedly to be  built in Juanchaco, is just a complementary training operation  for the military engineers. This type of operation is almost  like a generous donation for Colombia. But no one understands  and no Colombian can conceive of how the United States can  invest $700 million in something supposedly as simple as a small  school and a health center.    The troops have not been able to disembark because of the  problems that have cropped up regarding their arrival. Their  orders were to arrive at port, disembark, and move out  immediately. The U.S. military says that if the Colombian  Government's decision is delayed any longer, Colombia would  simply have to return the $700 million and the U.S. troops would  go back the way they came. In Juanchaco, meanwhile, the people  do not seem to want the foreigners around, even though they say  they are not Marines and that they are not invading Colombia; on  the contrary, the soldiers say they want to offer our country  great assistance.</p>

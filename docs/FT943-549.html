			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / International Company News: India to relaunch international sale of telecom equity India is preparing to revive the postponed international equity offering by VSNL, its international telecommunications monopoly, following the recent successful issue by Pakistan Telecom which attracted Dollars 900m from international investors. In meetings in Bombay this week, VSNL - which is 85 per cent state-owned - provisionally agreed for the issue to be relaunched by the winners of the original mandate, Kleinwort Benson and Salomon Brothers, and Jardine Fleming, whose handling of the Pakistan Telecom sale has been widely praised. The bankers have indicated that they are ready to underwrite VSNL's offer of 17.5m shares at between Rs1,100 (Dollars 35) and Rs1,200 a share. This figure is well below the price of Rs1,400 which the government saw as a minimum when it launched the offer last May. It seems that Indian officials have reluctantly accepted that investors regarded the original offer as overpriced, and they now seem ready to agree to the lower figure. The original issue failed partly because of the ambitious pricing but also because investor sentiment turned against emerging markets following the rise in interest rates in the US. Investment bankers now see a window of opportunity but warn that VSNL will have to move quickly because it was essentially relaunching a stale deal. 'It would be better to go sooner rather than later because the demand might not be there in a couple of months,' said one banker. At the lower price, the government will receive about Dollars 650m from the offering - significantly less than the Dollars 1bn it had hoped to raise in May. If investor demand is sufficiently buoyant, a 'green shoe' option of an additional 2.5m shares will be exercised. Bankers hope the Indian cabinet will approve the issue in the next few days. The board of VSNL is expected to rubber-stamp the deal at a meeting tomorrow.</p>

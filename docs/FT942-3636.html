			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Campari for accountants - A look at a NatWest lending checklist If a National Westminster bank manager asks you in for Campari, he is not being sociable. As accountants in Greater Manchester have learnt recently, it is the acronym used by the UK high street bank for its lending decision checklist. Stung by small-business complaints of harsh treatment by banks during the recession, NatWest decided to try to improve mutual understanding by explaining itself better. 'Open seminars for small businesses tend to be confrontational,' says Trevor Adamson, director of the bank's Manchester region. 'We felt we would achieve more by talking to accountants who act for small businesses.' To distance the bank further, he persuaded the local society of chartered accountants and Manchester chamber of commerce and industry to run jointly four seminars, which NatWest then sponsored as part of Adamson's local contribution in his year as chamber president. Campari will never be the same again for the 140 accountants who have listened to Ian McIlveen's explanation of its meaning. To McIlveen, who makes regional head office lending decisions for projects costing more than local branch managers' discretion limits, 'C' is for character. Only businesses and projects of discernible good character will get their first tick on the checklist. 'A' is for ability - not just of the management to do what it says it will do, but also of professional advisers such as the accountant. 'M' is for means - not in terms of money, but the means and resources to run the business transparently so the bank can keep an eye on its investment. In particular, whether the business produces regular, up-to-date management accounts. 'P' is for purpose. There must be a clear reason for seeking money, with proper goals. This is where McIlveen also makes sure of legality, environmental considerations and the lender's potential liabilities. 'We like lending to things that are already under way,' he says. This makes him wary of diversification: a business expanding in familiar territory is more likely to know how much extra working capital might be needed, or whether it needs more fixed assets. 'A' is for amount. McIlveen worries more about lending too little than too much, as it is difficult to lend more for the same thing later. The bank also wants the customer to be putting something in as evidence of being in earnest. 'R' is for repayment. 'If we can't tick this, we might as well go home,' McIlveen says. 'There will be no more open-ended pledges, such as with overdrafts in the 1980s which never seemed to be reduced.' Finally, 'I' is for interest, the price the bank is going to charge. Only at this point is security considered. McIlveen says security is necessary to reassure the bank's depositors and shareholders, but is not now seen as a prime requirement in lending. 'If you have to realise security, it costs so much to get your money back you lose all your profit and more,' he says. 'It is at the end of the checklist because the most important thing is whether the project stands up.' The accountants were generally happier to know where they and their small business clients stood and how to manage the relationship better, particularly as McIlveen also advised on how to approach bank managers. Popping in for a vague chat about extending existing facilities is ill-advised; written business plans - enlivened by photographs - are encouraged, as are term loans at fixed interest rates. Only then will NatWest send someone to look round to start scoring 'C' for character points.</p>

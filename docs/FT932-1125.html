			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Canny survivor ready for carve-up deal: The local hero on whom mediators are pinning their hopes REVILED in Sarajevo as a traitor, Mr Fikret Abdic believes that he can save Bosnia's Moslems from annihilation. Mr Abdic, 47, has emerged from a long silence in his home town of Velika Kladusa in north-west Bosnia to challenge President Alija Izetbegovic for leadership of the Moslems. The bid is backed by the two international mediators, Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, who have been frustrated by the intransigence of Mr Izetbegovic. He is clinging to the idea of a united Bosnia, which is no longer on the western agenda. The mediators are looking for an alternative Moslem to cut a deal with Bosnian Serbs and Croats on partition of the republic. This week Mr Abdic made clear he was willing to do the job. Asked about the proposal for a three-way partition, Mr Abdic said no plan should be rejected out of hand. In defiance of Mr Izetbegovic, he joined a Bosnian presidency delegation to Geneva to begin talks on the carve-up. Mr Abdic is no newcomer to the political scene. In his native Cazinska Krajina, a densely populated entirely Moslem region of north-west Bosnia, he is known as Babo - Daddy in the local language. In elections for the Bosnian presidency in 1990 he won 1.2m votes - more than Mr Izetbegovic, who nevertheless became the first to hold the rotating position. Less religious than Mr Izetbegovic, Mr Abdic was always first and foremost a communist entrepreneur. He is credited with massively enriching Cazinska Krajina, one of Bosnia's poorest regions, by building up Agrokomerc, an agro-industrial plant. His fortunes plummeted when he was imprisoned in 1987 for issuing Dollars 300m (Pounds 200m) in unbacked promissory notes, Yugoslavia's biggest financial scandal. Mr Abdic's supporters claimed he was a political prisoner framed by jealous rivals in the ruling communist party. Others said he was just one of the country's more successful white-collar criminals. In any case, his stint in jail sent his popularity soaring. However, Mr Abdic never succeeded in garnering much support within the Moslem-led Party for Democratic Action. Throughout the vicissitudes of war he has remained in his Velika Kladusa bastion, where he dedicated himself to ensuring the survival of his enclave, one of the six-UN designated safe areas. The pocket is surrounded by Serb forces in Bosnia and neighbouring Croatia. This canny survivor has managed to keep up trade with Croatia despite the Serb blockade. He has even traded with the Serb besiegers, not entirely surprising as Serbs and Moslems in the region have traditionally close ties, having fought side by side as communist partisans in the second world war - not the case in most of Bosnia. He was praised in a recent edition of the Serbian army magazine Vojska for advocating an end to the war. 'Most Moslems want an end to the war and do not support the policies of Mr Izetbegovic,' he was quoted as saying. In spite of support from the international mediators and from Bosnians Serbs and Croats - all eager to see the partition of Bosnia over and done with - it would be premature to write off Mr Izetbegovic Mr Abdic is a local hero in his fiefdom. In Sarajevo he counts for little. After 15 months of fighting, Mr Izetbegovic has built up an army and nominated generals who are not likely to ditch him now. The Moslem-led army has in recent weeks seized Croat-held territory in central Bosnia and is unlikely to accept a carve-up.</p>

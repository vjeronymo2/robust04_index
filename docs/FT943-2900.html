			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Increased market share helps Kwik-Fit to Pounds 15m A gain from property sales, coupled with a sharply lower interest charge and higher volume, helped Kwik-Fit Holdings, the tyre, exhaust and brakes fitter, to increase pre-tax profits by 33 per cent in the half year to end-August. On sales ahead 14 per cent at Pounds 150.4m (Pounds 132.1m) the pre-tax result was Pounds 15.2m (Pounds 11.5m) including Pounds 761,000 (Pounds 207,000) from property disposals. Net interest payable fell from Pounds 1.06m to Pounds 307,000, and borrowings from Pounds 17m to Pounds 5.6m. Mr Tom Farmer, chairman, said that marketing initiatives introduced last year had brought in more customers, leading to further increases in market share. The board was 'more than satisfied - in fact we are delighted.' Extra volume fed through to a 20 per cent rise in operating profits from Pounds 12.3m to Pounds 14.8m. Operating margins rose from 9.3 to 9.8 per cent. The UK contributed Pounds 11m (Pounds 9.5m) of operating profits on Pounds 117.4m (Pounds 104.1m) of turnover. More than half the sales were accounted for by tyres, where the group lifted its market share from 14 to 18 per cent. Sales of exhausts in the UK were 4 per cent higher at Pounds 36.8m, while sales in the new brakes sector almost doubled to Pounds 8m following a national launch last November. The group is aiming for 10 per cent of the UK brakes market in the next couple of years. Sales overseas - in the Netherlands and Belgium - rose by 18 per cent to Pounds 33m (Pounds 28m), yielding operating profits of Pounds 3.8m (Pounds 2.8m). Capital expenditure increased from Pounds 3.8m to Pounds 9m, reflecting the acquisition and development of new properties. Mr John Houston, finance director, said spending last year had been restrained - 'but now we have more confidence in the potential of our business.' At August 31 the group was operating a total of 651 (632) centres. A further 27 were being developed. Mr Farmer said he believed there was room for a further 200 outlets in the UK, which has 494 centres. Earnings per share increased from 4.7p to 6.2p, and the interim dividend is 1.7p (1.5p). COMMENT Tyres and exhausts might seem unexciting markets, but Kwik-Fit has found the right formula to make them pay. Its share of both sectors is rising, adding to its buying power, while there is everything to play for in the new brakes market. The strong brand name and narrow focus has helped it to survive a period of intense competition, and it now feels confident enough to speed up expansion. While plenty of competition remains, it is fragmented. Earnings are expected to be 11p for the full year and 13p in 1995-96, which puts the stock at a 10 per cent discount to the market. This looks grudging for a company behind such a successful retail concept.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 15 (KCNA) -- A seminar of party  cadres training centres was held here Tuesday on the lapse of 30  years since the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il began to work  at the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea.    Speeches were made there on the subject "Holding in High  Esteem the Dear Leader Comrade Kim Chong-il at the Head of Our  Party is a Great Historical Event Which Brought About a New  Upswing in the Development of the Party and the Revolution" and  other subjects.    Comrade Kim Chong-il has comprehensively completed and  brilliantly applied the revolutionary theory and method  including the chuche-based theory of the party building, thus  victoriously leading the whole party and the entire people to  the accomplishment of the socialist cause and performing the  immortal feats for the party and revolution, the era and the  history, the speakers said.    They noted that the feats performed by him in the work of  training party cadres are that he has brought up cadres to be  competent true leading men who have been tested politically and  ideologically in a revolutionary way and prepared theoretically  and practically and thus firmly built core elements to firmly  defend and glorify the party, the revolution and the socialist  system.    Today the socialism of our style is winning victory one  after  another and our party is displaying its invincible might, not  wavering in any vicious anti-DPRK moves of the imperialists, the  speakers pointed out, saying this is a clear demonstration of  the greatness of the idea and the leadership of the dear leader.    Brilliant today and bright future of the party, the country  and the people lie in holding him in high esteem at the head of  the party and the revolution forever with loyalty and filial  piety, the speakers stressed.</p>

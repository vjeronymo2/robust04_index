			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Looking to a 'new Japan': A more assertive Tokyo is sought IN planning the party launched yesterday, Mr Tsutomu Hata has talked grandly of a 'new Japanese politics' and even of a 'new Japan'. But he has avoided specific policy statements, arguing that the details must come later. This has allowed Mr Hata and his associate, Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the Liberal Democratic party's former secretary-general and backroom boss, to be placed at various points on the political spectrum and has raised doubts about the direction of Japanese foreign policy. There is talk of a Hata coalition government with the Social Democratic party, formerly the Japan Socialist party, which, by most definitions, is left-wing. However, Mr Hata's group is generally perceived to be friendly with Komeito (the Clean Government party), as close as Japan comes to the religious right. Underneath the lofty visions, Mr Hata and Mr Ozawa have indicated that a prime reason for political reform is to create a more assertive Japan, a government less willing to capitulate to the US on trade issues and more active in contributing funds and personnel to international peacekeeping operations. If Mr Hata gained power after the July 18 election, which would only be in a coalition, and if he is able to exercise influence, over time, Japanese policies could change. Japanese nationalism would also be up for redefinition, and a 'strong, self-confident Japan' could be interpreted by Asian neighbours as a 'threatening Japan'. Mr Hata and Mr Ozawa see themselves as internationalists, and the brochure explaining the philosophy of Reform Forum 21, the precursor to the party launched yesterday, is adorned with a large picture of the globe and a quick rundown on the collapse of the Cold War and the emergence of an 'international society'. But the two have relatively little international experience. They enjoy holding 'salons' with diplomats and foreign correspondents in Tokyo, and have clocked up frequent flier miles on work-related travel, but have spent most of their lives cultivating local constituents and convincing companies to donate generously. A sign of Mr Hata's navety in front of an international audience came in 1987 during an address to US Congress representatives, when he suggested that Japanese have longer intestines than Americans - he was defending Japan's closed beef market at the time - and still claims he was misunderstood. As finance minister, Mr Hata was in favour of deregulation of financial markets, though deregulation slowed last year, which, he said, was inevitable during a post-bubble period in which vulnerable financial institutions are unable to cope with rapid change. 'We will do business here with the same international rules as elsewhere. It is wrong to think the government looks after the Japanese banks and they get along somehow. We are always keeping an eye on banks to make sure they do business in proper ways,' he said. On the Uruguay Round multilateral trade talks, as agriculture minister and, more recently, as finance minister, which is more significant, he has defended Japan's closed rice market. An agriculture minister is paid to defend the rice market, but other ministers are more able to express opinions on this sensitive subject. 'I have been saying for about five years that the importance of the rice issue in global trade talks is negligible,' Mr Hata said late last year. 'The US and European Community have the largest number of issues to solve. Export subsidies are a more substantial issue.' On foreign policy, both Mr Hata and Mr Ozawa say the present political system has ensured that there is not enough debate of important issues, and complain that politicians are dependent on bureaucrats for policy direction. They joke that coherent foreign policy cannot be made by incoherent politicians. Mr Ozawa has been the more aggressive on foreign policy, and is seen by some Japanese as being far too aggressive. He strongly supported the sending of military personnel to the UN peacekeeping operation in Cambodia, and was keen for Japan to participate, in some form, during the Gulf war, when minesweepers were eventually dispatched. For a country which has generally wanted a low military profile since the Second World war's end in 1945, Mr Ozawa's ideas are controversial. He claims that he is not a hawk, but merely wants Japan to play an appropriate role in the maintenance of 'international security'.</p>

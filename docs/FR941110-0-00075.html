			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Continued implementation of time limited agreement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for skilled nursing facilities and nursing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities frustrated many aspects of nursing home reform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and, in a practical way, rendered them inoperable. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these reasons, a HCFA Ruling was signed on August 26, 1992  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eliminating time limited agreements for skilled nursing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities and nursing facilities participating in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare and Medicaid programs and these regulations further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopt this position.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 488.308 implements sections 1819(g)(2)(A)(iii)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 1919(g)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, which require that each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> skilled nursing facility and nursing facility be subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a standard survey not later than 15 months after the last  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> day of the previous standard survey and that the statewide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average interval between standard surveys not exceed 12  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> months. The regulation specifies when and how the average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interval is computed, specific conditions that may prompt a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard or an abbreviated standard survey and HCFA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrective action to ensure that State survey agencies meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 12 month average interval requirement. These final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rules also codify the substance of the HCFA ruling described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above by eliminating from the regulations the requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for time limited agreements for SNFs and NFs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter requested clarification of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15 month interval by asking if determination would be ``to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the day'' or ``during the 15th month.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We intend to calculate the 15-month interval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by counting days. The survey agency calculates the number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of days between the last day of the current standard survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the last day of the facility's previous standard survey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters recommended that survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequency be related to the compliance/noncompliance history  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the facility. A few commenters suggested that States be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to conduct more frequent inspections of nursing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> homes with poor care histories. One commenter recommended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that States take facility compliance history into account  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when establishing survey cycles and conduct more frequent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveys of nursing homes with a history of substandard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality of care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We are retaining this provision of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation as written because we believe that the Act, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously cited, provides a framework within which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State survey agency can establish a flexible survey cycle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that effectively ensures that quality health care is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> furnished in a safe environment. Without restricting this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexibility, we expect that State survey agencies will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider a facility's compliance history when scheduling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard surveys and revisits. The survey agency may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conduct surveys as frequently as necessary to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with participation requirements, to confirm that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously cited deficiencies have been corrected, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigate complaints and to ensure that certain changes do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not cause a decline in the quality of care furnished to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters recommended that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional provision be incorporated which would allow State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey agencies to conduct tailored or abbreviated surveys  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in those facilities which were deficiency-free in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previous standard survey. Some additional commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended that facilities with a record of deficiency-free  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveys be inspected less frequently than every 12 months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter specifically suggested that surveys not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted yearly if there is in place good surveillance and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring from the State, and that, perhaps, over time a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey would be conducted every third year as hospitals are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveyed by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Healthcare Organizations. One commenter recommended a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstration project that would test the possibility of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extended survey cycle for excellent facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

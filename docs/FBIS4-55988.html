			<p>BFN     [Text] Knin, May 24 (TANJUG) - The second phase of talks  about the normalisation of relations between the republic of  Serb Krajina and Croatia will start in early June, a U.N.  Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman in Krajina said on Tuesday  [24 May].    Speaking at a regular news conference of military, police  and  civilian UNPROFOR officials in sector south of the  U.N.-protected area of Krajina, a spokesman said that UNPROFOR  central commissions had given a positive assessment at their  latest meeting of the implementation of the Zagreb agreement on  the cessation of hostilities signed by Krajina and Croatia.  They agreed that the next phase of talks about economic and  humanitarian issues could begin now.    The republic of Serb Krajina was proclaimed by the local  Serbs in their ancestral lands within former Croatia in 1991, in  response to the republic's violent secession from the former  Yugoslav federation and violations of the local Serbs' rights.  Krajina has been a U.N.-protected area since 1992 and 14,000  peacekeepers are deployed there. Krajina and Croatia started  the negotiating process in March 1994, with U.S. and Russian  mediation, and agreed on a ceasefire and separation of the two  armies along the 1,000-km long lines of separation, currently  controlled by UNPROFOR.    The spokesman said that a meeting between Krajina President  Milan Martic and UNPROFOR Chief of Civil Affairs in sector South  Enrique Aguilar on Monday [23 May] had focused on the assessment  of the situation ahead of the beginning of negotiations about  economic issues, which the spokesman described as having been  somewhat postponed by the Croatian Government.    The meeting also dealt with the venue of the talks, the  spokesman said, but refused to disclose further details. He  only said that Geneva and some other places outside Croatia were  discussed and added that Krajina representatives would receive a  letter with the time and place proposed for the talks.    The U.N. secretary-general's special envoy Yasushi Akashi  told Martic in a telephone conversation on Monday that he was  interested in the resumption of the talks, but that he did not  intend to accept Martic's proposal to be the chief mediator in  the future talks, because talks about economic issues were  within the jurisdiction of the international conference on the  former Yugoslavia, the spokesman said.    Colonel Bill Morton, deputy UNPROFOR commander of Sector  South, said that UNPROFOR's observation posts had been placed in  the area of disengagement but that none of them had been placed  in its final position. The corrections will be made only after  the mine fields have been cleared, he said.    Col. Morton said that the lines of disengagement on Mt.  Velebit were difficult to control because of the rugged terrain.  Smaller units of both sides have been sighted in the area of  disengagement in the region, he said, and they seem to be  observing each other.    The deputy chief of UNPROFOR civilian police has announced  that new police substations would be opened in this sector  within eight days, and added that the civilian police has  established a fixed way of operation within the area of  disengagement and that serb and Croat police units have begun to  patrol the area as well.</p>

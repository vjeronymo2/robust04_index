			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna (DPA) -- The International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) is still waiting with the inspection of the  5-megawatt research reactor in the North Korean nuclear center  of Yongbyon. The authority first wants binding promises from  Pyongyang that the inspectors are permitted to carry out  important control measures, IAEA spokesman Hans Friedrich Meyer  told DPA in Vienna on Thursday [28 April]. "We will certainly  not only stand aside and watch!"    Last week, North Korea had offered to allow the IAEA to  monitor the necessary exchange of the fuel rods. In the letter,  the IAEA inspectors had been invited to be "present." "We  explained to North Korea once again that we want to carry out  inspection activities and what they are," Meyer said. As  reported from diplomatic circles in Vienna, the nuclear  authority wants to measure above all the burned-out fuel rods.  The diplomats hope that such analyses will provide them with  the information on whether plutonium was set aside for the  construction of nuclear bombs.    As early as in its first answer to Pyongyang, which accepted  in principle the invitation from North Korea, the nuclear  authority had pointed out that inspections are also becoming  necessary again in the other nuclear plants. In particular, the  radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon is at issue. In contrasts  to all agreements, North Korea denied access to the laboratory  to the experts of the UN organization in the course of the  latest IAEA inspection one month ago. As a result, the nuclear  authority decided to refer the nuclear dispute to the UN  Security Council.</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading FEARS THAT the Bundesbank may not, after all, reduce German interest rates this week led to strong selling in Footsie futures in London yesterday, sending the underlying cash market lower, writes Joel Kibazo. The high of the day for the September contract on the FT-SE 100, recorded at 3,070, came within minutes. Thereafter, the future came under selling pressure as the doubts over a reduction in German rates took hold. That sentiment soon spread from derivatives to the equity market, bringing a sell-off there also. The September future fell to a discount to cash of 5 points just after midday, a move that was repeated several times over the next few hours, although it traded in line with cash for most of the session. The day's low of 3,035 was registered in the last half-hour of business, but nerves steadied before the close and September finished at 3,042, a 4-point premium to the cash market. Volume in the near month contract was a healthy 11,084 lots, while that in the December contract, which closed at 3,064, was 3,040 lots. Turnover in traded options improved to 30,728 contracts from Monday's poor level of 20,044. However, business in the FT-SE 100 option was below Monday's total, reaching 7,866 lots by the close. A big buyer of the December 40 calls in Amstrad sent its volume to 6,640 contracts.</p>

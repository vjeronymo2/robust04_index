			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The very tense situation affecting the country and  the mobilizations at the national level forced President Juan  Carlos Wasmosy to deliver a speech that, according to various  groups, provided nothing for solving the serious problems  affecting our country. He did not even refer to the main issue  (the price of cotton) that made peasants decide to march today.    Wasmosy made several promises when he said his government is  already "promoting solutions to the unjust structure of land  possession and ownership as shown by the latest agricultural  census: the drop in production of basic agricultural products,  distorted credit coverage, and the limitations of technical  assistance." He labeled as an achievement the implementation of  economic measures aimed at ensuring producers access to  appropriate and fair credits, and to technical assistance  adjusted to our needs.    In relation to the promises made, he said: "The executive  branch proposes a policy of expropriation of unproductive land;  therefore, it will ask Congress for the creation of a bicameral  committee to establish the necessary legal regulations. Also the  reorganization of public administration to end corruption and  impunity, which is something we are doing that will be  expedited." [sentence fragment as published]    He added that within 90 days, in consultation with the  involved groups, the general guidelines for a medium- and  long-range action plan will be adjusted to determine measures in  two main areas: A) the national agricultural policy and B)  reforms of the institutions in charge of agriculture within the  framework of state reform.    President Wasmosy strongly defended dialogue as the  mechanism  for solving the current crisis, and within this context he said  the Coordination Council for Social Development is one more  testimony that the doors of dialogue are and will remain open as  a commitment to consolidating democracy.    Wasmosy also made several appeals. He appealed to all  sectors  of the population to act with moderation, calm, talent, and  great responsibility. He also appealed "to agricultural  exporters, industrialists, and the middlemen to become more  active in the national effort to give the rural sector better  conditions, and especially to contribute with preferential  treatment for those producers who have not yet achieved adequate  production and to pay the highest price for products in  accordance with market rules.    Wasmosy also said: "The many problems inherited by this  democracy shows a serious picture that we are identifying with  the firm decision to find the appropriate solutions without  falling into the deceiving demagogic and populist formulas of  very sad memories of the past.    Wasmosy also said: We cannot ignore that we are in a  difficult political, economic, and social situation caused by  our internal limitations and by the demands of the new  international situation that have a direct impact on the  population, especially those linked to the economy's weakest  sector.</p>

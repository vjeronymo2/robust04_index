The  mountains of Irpinia, his traditional fiefdom, have produced a  flood of support votes with a view to next Sunday's [13  February] runoff organized by the PPI's regional steering  committee. This clear message from Avellino gave rise to some  controversy following the halt called from Rome: "Hands off our  candidate; Ciriaco remains our leader." Midday 10 February was  the deadline for putting forward the candidates who will be  subject to the vote by party members and supporters in two days'  time. There were no less than 8,142 signatures in support of  the former prime minister, put forward as a candidate for the  lower house in the constituency that comprises all the  municipalities of Upper Irpinia, including Nusco.    De Mita virtually doubled the number gained by another  outgoing parliamentarian, Interior Minister Nicola Mancino, who  gathered 4,322 signatures for the senatorial constituency of  central Avellino. All the rest were out of the running. There  were 2,341 votes for Giuseppe Gargani, chairman of the Justice  Committee, competing for the Lower Irpinia lower house  constituency; 1,820 for Ortensio Zecchino, the Popular Party's  regional coordinator, put forward for the Upper Irpinia  senatorial constituency; 1,006 for Gianfranco Rotondi, regional  councillor, competing for the central Avellino lower house  constituency. Rotondi is competing against Francesco Pionati,  the television Channel 1 news reporter who also hopes to stand  as a candidate but who has sharply opposed the runoffs, refusing  to take part and describing them as "like some kind of San Remo  [popular song] festival, where all the winners are known in  advance." Gerardo Bianco did not compete in the first round  either, having decided to stand down for good. [passage omitted]</p>

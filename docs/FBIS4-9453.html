			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 25 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic's  Nuclear Safety Office imposed a fine of 500,000 crowns (over  $17.200) on the Czech Power Company (CEZ) for breaching an  Office regulation concerning the nuclear power plant now under  construction in Temelin, south Bohemia.    Under the regulation, the assembly of the equipment at the  first bloc of the Temelin project was to be halted until certain  shortcomings were removed, Miroslav Kejval from the Green Party  (SZ) said at a press conference today.    CEZ spokesman Miroslav Novak said the fine was imposed on  CEZ  as early as last September in punishment [for] not removing  waste from a "clean" assemblage, despite a warning from the  Nuclear Safety Office. The fine was lowered to 300,000 crowns  after all circumstances were clarified, he explained. The  shortcomings unveiled by the Office were promptly put right and  construction continued, Novak said.    If the district authority in Ceske Budejovice believes a  change in the automatic command system at the Temelin station to  be essential, the project's construction would have to undergo  new approval procedure, according to Kejval. The procedure  could be initiated by the Environment Ministry, district  authority or mayors of towns standing to be affected by a  Temelin accident, Kejval said. The SZ, along with their  colleagues from Austria and Germany, were to initiate the  procedure because they viewed the above change as fundamental,  he added.    It is impossible to speak about any new license for the  construction of the whole Temelin station, Novak stressed,  saying any new approval procedure would concern only the  essential changes themselves.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["DPRK FM Spokesman Refutes Reports About 'Arms Deal </F> Contract' With Southern Yemen" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the  Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  today answered a question put by KCNA on the reports about an  "arms deal contract" allegedly signed by the DPRK with the  Southern Yemen forces.    He said:    Some foreign news media are now spreading reports that the  DPRK signed an "arms deal a "new contract" with the Southern  Yemen forces, according to which it will supply Aden with jet  planes, tanks, tactical missiles and other combat equipment.    This is an utterly groundless fabrication.    It is by no means accidental that such reports are afloat  when the manoeuvres to stifle the DPRK over the fictitious  "nuclear issue" have reached a grave stage.    We cannot but think that they are underlain by the political  intention to impair the authority of the DPRK and isolate it in  the international arena.    Our country which has steadfastly maintained the principle  of  non-interference in relations with other countries consistently  calls for a negotiated solution of disputes between the parties  concerned.    The dispute between the Northern and Southern Yemen is  merely  an internal dispute, and it is inconceivable for us to "help"  any one side.    From the very moment the dispute broke out between the North  and the South of Yemen we have hoped to see it solved peacefully  at an early date in the interests of the entire Yemeni people  without outside interference, and there is no change in this  principled stand of ours now.    Truth will be made clear.    No insidious attempt can tarnish the image of our dignified  Republic or damage the excellent relations between our country  and Yemen.</p>

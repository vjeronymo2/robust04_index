			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAY AREA QUAKE;  </P> <P> QUAKE DEALT COSTLY BLOW TO MAJOR AGRICULTURAL REGION  </P> <P> Mountains of cans and drums filled with 400,000 tons of the summer tomato  harvest came tumbling down when Tuesday's quake struck Hollister in San Benito  County, knocking out the corrugated steel walls of many of the town's 14  warehouses.  </P> <P> In Watsonville, the frozen food processing capital of the country, an ammonia  leak at the Green Giant plant could cause $20 million in losses to frozen  Brussels sprouts, broccoli and other vegetables; six other processing plants  there were also damaged.  </P> <P> And in the tiny town of Freedom, just north of Watsonville, the earth's sudden  quiver Tuesday knocked down thousands of pounds of apples stacked in bins,  burying a partner in the H. A. Rider &amp; Sons cider processing company. Tom  Rider remains hospitalized from his injuries and the company rehired about 40  laid-off workers to help with the cleanup.  </P> <P> These are but some examples of the still mounting losses to homes, farms and  livelihoods that were still being tallied Friday in the aftermath of the  devastating quake, the epicenter of which was just to the north of the rich  agricultural area of Monterey, San Benito, Santa Cruz and southern Santa Clara  counties.  </P> <P> Farmers and food processors ship billions of dollars of fruit and vegetables,  providing much of the area's employment. At the height of the growing season,  the countryside looks like an uninterrupted carpet of green all the way to the  horizon. Monterey County farmers last year, for example, earned about $1.1  billion, making it the fourth-richest agricultural county in the nation.  </P> <P> Winter-harvested vegetables still in the fields suffered little damage in the  quake, farmers and processors said, even though power failures caused an  interruption in irrigation in some areas and temperatures soared Thursday to  unseasonable levels. Damage to large food processors, such as Green Giant, and  blocked roads could delay getting vegetables to market and cause as-yet unknown  losses. One estimate for Santa Cruz County put the loss at between $5 million  and $6 million.  </P> <P> The main losses were to fruits and vegetables stored in warehouses that were  damaged, although apples knocked from trees by the quake could also result in  losses. Also hit were many of the inexpensive houses occupied by the area's  5,000 field workers.  </P> <P> "The problem is a lot of them lost their homes, and they haven't reported back  to work," said Ronald Tyler, director of the UC Agricultural Extension Service  for Santa Cruz County.  </P> <P> Workers whose homes were damaged or destroyed have been camping out in their  front yards, on the high school football fields and elsewhere around  Watsonville and the prospects for rebuilding the housing seems bleak, observers  said.  </P> <P> "We don't have low-income housing in Watsonville," said Jose Villasana, a Santa  Cruz County mental health worker. "And now the problem is going to get worse.  We're just waiting for word on what to tell people. But even if the city wanted  to help, the bottom line is there is no low-income housing."  </P> <P> P. J. Mecozzi, president of Del Mar Foods, a medium-size food processor in  Watsonville, said many of his 400 workers have spent the past few days at  shelters and parks and other open places. "We've had a hard time getting our  crews back to work because they have been displaced from their homes," he said.  </P> <P> Del Mar Foods resumed operations Thursday after electric power was restored.  The stored food was undamaged because it stayed cool despite the disruption,  but the cleanup and the lack of workers could delay frozen food deliveries  across the country, he said.  </P> <P> About $1 million worth of food was lost when cases of food tumbled to the floor  from stacked pallets and broke open. He said his losses -- representing about  10% of what he had stored -- were about average for warehouses in the area.  </P> <P> Processors from Santa Cruz to Salinas said they suffered minor losses as a  result of the disruption in electricity on Wednesday. Some areas remained  without power on Friday. Damage was reported as far south as the southern  Monterey County town of Gonzales, where the quake ruptured tanks at the  Monterey Vineyard and 20,000 gallons of wine leaked out.  </P> <P> "The loss will be in the millions," said Steve Arnoldy, 39, director of  operations for San Benito Foods, which owns six tomato warehouses in Hollister.  "Some of our buildings we can't even get into. It's a miracle there was no one  in the warehouses."  </P> <P> In Castroville, which last year harvested 34,200 tons of artichokes and  considers itself the artichoke center of the world, the quake resulted in few  losses, although power failures forced growers to suspend the current harvest  for a day, Monterey County agriculture officials said.  </P> <P> Continuing problems with power supplies prompted the local utility to ask  Artichoke Industries Inc., the nation's main cannery and processor of  artichokes, to scale back its use of power.  </P> <P> "We've cut back just about as far as we can go without quitting," said John  Podio, the plant manager. Lights, unused conveyors and motors, and even the  office copier have been shut off, he said. "They asked us twice yesterday, and  we just shut down. Today, we've got a minimum crew, but it looks like we're  going to make it," he said.  </P></p>

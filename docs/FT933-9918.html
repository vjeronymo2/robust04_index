			<p>930806 FT  06 AUG 93 / International Company News in Brief: Eastman Kodak Eastman Kodak, the photographic products company which is in the throes of restructuring, prompted a wave of speculation on Wall Street yesterday when it announced that it would make a significant announcement this morning, writes Nikki Tait in New York. The company declined to elaborate on the announcement, but some analysts believed that Kodak could be poised to name a new finance director. The former chief financial officer, Mr Christopher Steffen, quit in April after only 11 weeks with the company, because of a management disagreement with Kodak's chairman, Mr Kay Whitmore.</p>

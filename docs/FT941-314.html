			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Hopewell posts 83% rise after six months Hopewell Holdings, the Hong Kong property and construction group controlled by Mr Gordon Wu, yesterday announced an 83 per cent leap in profits to HKDollars 1.5bn (USDollars 194m) for the six months to December 31, up from HKDollars 843.5m in the same period the previous year, due to an exceptional item which yielded 73 per cent of earnings. Earnings at the operating level slipped 8 per cent to HKDollars 358.9m, reflecting the role played by November's HKDollars 1.2bn spin-off of Consolidated Electric Power Asia (CEPA), a vehicle incorporating Hopewell's power stations. The results put Mr Wu on track to reach the doubling of full-year earnings that he forecast in November. This would require profits in the full year to reach HKDollars 4bn. However, if achieved it will be on the back of certain reversals in strategy, including the proposed sell-off of the remaining 51 per cent of a 44-storey residential tower block and car park in Happy Valley. This is likely to yield profits around HKDollars 850m, according to early estimates. CEPA itself turned in net profits of HKDollars 20.5m, which according to Hopewell calculations equates to HKDollars 101.7m on a pro-forma combined basis, and compares with HKDollars 60.8m in 1992. The company did not undertake any business until November 1993. Hopewell also benefited from a sharply lower tax bill in 1993, at HKDollars 63.2m compared with HKDollars 85.6m in the previous interim. The Hong Kong profits tax levy was slashed to less than one third of the 1992 interim bill, partly due to the 1 per cent cut in profits tax. Earnings per share rose to 80 per cent to 36 cents from 20 cents in 1992. Directors are proposing an 18 cent dividend, up from 16 cents.</p>

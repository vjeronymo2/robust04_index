			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 17 KYODO -- President Jiang Zemin urged  the international community Tuesday [17 May] not to overestimate  China's influence on North Korea to settle an international  dispute over Pyongyang's suspected nuclear development program,  Japanese officials said.    Jiang made the comment in a meeting with Wataru Kubo,  secretary general of Japan's No. 2 opposition party, the Social  Democratic Party [of Japan], the officials said.    Jiang described as "a matter of the past" a remark by  Japan's  former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano that the 1937 Nanjing  massacre was a fabrication, the officials said.    "Let's call it over. Let's proceed toward the future," Jiang  was quoted as saying.</p>

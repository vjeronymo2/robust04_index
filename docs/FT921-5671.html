			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / International Company News: S African insurer 51% ahead at halfway A SUBSTANTIAL improve- ment on the underwriting account allowed Mutual and Federal (M&amp;F), South Africa's largest short-term insurer, to increase after-tax profits by 51 per cent to R68.1m (Dollars 24m) for the half-year to end-December. Gross premium income rose by R59m to R600m, while net premiums increased by 11 per cent to R506m. The underwriting surplus increased considerably to R25.6m compared with the R3.5m recorded at the interim stage in 1990. Investment income rose to R71m from R56m. Earnings per share rose to 146 cents a share from 96 cents, and the interim dividend was lifted by 25 per cent to 25 cents per share. Mr Ken Saggers, managing director, said the good results reflected the improved health of the short-term insurance industry which he attributed to more realistic rating policies. In 1990, the industry suffered unprecedented aggregate underwriting losses of about R250m. M&amp;F's improved underwriting performance was the result of an absence of natural catastrophe payouts which in 1990 accounted for more than R20m at the interim stage. Mr Saggers said the ongoing recession, and increasing theft, arson and fraud would continue to present the industry with a challenging operating environment. The short term activities of Commercial Union, the South African insurer in which Commercial Union of the UK is a large shareholder, also benefited from a turnround on the underwriting account in the year to December 1991. Pre-tax profit rose to R58.9m from R27.3m, largely due to a R5.3m underwriting surplus compared with a R18.8m deficit in 1990. Net income rose to R48.8m from R29.1m. Earnings per share increased to 488.4 cents from 291.4, and the dividend was lifted by 35 per cent to 142 cents.</p>

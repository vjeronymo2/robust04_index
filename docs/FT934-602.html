			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Profit-taking halted as equity buyers reappear - Market Report The optimists refused to be daunted by early falls in UK stocks yesterday and, encouraged again by firmness in stock index futures, shares were driven ahead towards the close by suggestions that a Swiss investment house was putting together a large buy programme in UK equities. In early trading the FT-SE 100 Index was down nearly 10 points as overnight profit-taking orders were completed. But the day's low in the 3,333 area was reached quickly and the market then benefited from firmness in other European bourses and a solid premium on the March contract on the Footsie index. With several sectors facing profit-taking recommendations from UK broking houses, upward progress was difficult and the gain in the market was stopped at around 16 points on the Footsie before profit-takers came back again when UK bonds turned sluggish. The final punch came when the March futures contract moved to a strong premium and shares moved close to the early highs. At the end of the session, the FT-SE Index showed a net gain of 13.3 to 3,355.7. Renewed demand for the smaller stocks took the FT-SE Mid 250 Index to a new peak of 3,727, up 20.1 on the day. Traders saw yesterday's performance from the stock market as convincing evidence that the big investment institutions will not let share prices fall very far below existing levels before re-entering the market as buyers of UK equities. However, buying was somewhat selective with several sectors lagging behind a stock market which has performed spectacularly over the past two months. Significantly, Seaq volume increased as the market turned higher and the final total was 779.2m shares compared with 756.2m on Tuesday; equity trading retail value in the previous session was Pounds 1.78bn, an impressive figure for a pre-Christmas trading session. Non-Footsie business made up around 66 per cent of yesterday's Seaq total, a relatively high level compared to recent sessions which have been led by the Footsie stocks. Interest rate hopes remained in place, inspiring further gains in the merchant banks and other financial shares. Building stocks, also closely linked to interest rate hopes, did well and the stores sector, which has lain under a cloud, found buyers. Strategists noted that the London market appeared to brush off news from the corporate sector, which ranged from renewed threats of problems at Euro Disney to another asset sale by Lasmo, the UK-based oil exploration company. Sentiment was also helped at first by a steadier tone in Uk government bonds, although this was unsettled later when both short and longer dated bonds turned easier. The domestic bond market has been a prime force behind UK equities, as the fall in returns on bonds has made shares more attractive to institutional investors. However, while impressed by the high trading volumes reported in the stock market, traders pointed out that marketmakers are still trying to keep books tight ahead of the extended Christmas holiday weekend, and that this makes share prices highly responsive to sudden changes in investment direction. The big institutions have largely closed down their trading positions for the extended holiday break and are now content to overhaul portfolio positions, trading only at the margins of their holdings.</p>

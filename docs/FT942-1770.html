			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures traded at a discount to cash for most of the session and pulled the cash market lower, with dealers concerned by the weak dollar and falls in bonds, writes Joel Kibazo. The September contract on the FT-SE 100 Index started trading at 2,972 and briefly moved ahead to 2,982, a small premium to cash, as some dealers adjusted their books. There after the direction was downward for the rest of the day, with trading influenced by currency factors and declining bonds. The uncertain near term outlook for interest rates and inflation was also cited as a factor for the poor business in the morning. September tumbled heavily in the afternoon after Wall Street opened lower, and dragged the cash market below the 2,950 level. The future finished at 2,938, down 35 from its previous close and at a 14-point discount to its fair value premium of about 13 points. Volume fell to 14,339 contracts, highlighting the decision of many institutions to remain on the sidelines. It was also a poor day in the traded options, where turnover eased back to 29,929 contracts, of which 13,743 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option. A seller of the August 180 calls in Rolls-Royce made it the most active stock option with a closing total of 2,567 lots transacted.</p>

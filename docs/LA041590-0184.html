			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TERM MAKES WAVES  </P> <P> Turtles, teen-age mutant ninja or the real kind, are reptiles, not amphibians!  In an otherwise fun article one of your writers (March 31) described the  current craze about the "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles." While recognizing that  they had shells, thus turtles, therefore making them reptiles, the writer  refers to them as "awesome amphibians."  </P> <P> Perhaps the writer is confused between non-amphibian and the adjective  amphibious. While many amphibians are amphibious, some are aquatic and others  are completely terrestrial. The same is true for turtles. While Ninja Turtles  have smooth skin (after all they are "mutant turtles") they do have a shell  with its scaly covering, hence are reptiles. Based on my observations of these  mythical beasts, they are awesome amphibious reptiles!  </P> <P> BAYARD H.

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Volvo head discloses SKr9.5m salary MR PEHR Gyllenhammar, the chairman of Volvo, yesterday bowed to pressure from the Swedish vehicle maker's small shareholders and disclosed that his annual salary is SKr9.5m (Pounds 860,000), making him Sweden's highest-paid executive. Addressing Volvo's annual general meeting, attended by more than 2,000 shareholders, Mr Gyllenhammar also gave details of his other benefits, the salary package of Mr Soren Gyll, the chief executive, and the 'golden parachutes' paid to two former top executives who left the company last year. Mr Gyllenhammar announced that the Volvo board would set up an audit committee and a committee for management development and remuneration for a trial period of a year to counter accusations by Aktiespararna, the Swedish shareholders' association, that he presided over excessive pay deals for himself and colleagues when Volvo was tumbling into loss. Mr Soren Gyll, chief executive, said conditions for Volvo in 1993 continued to be 'extremely tough'. There were benefits from the SKr9bn cost-cutting programme and signs of upturn in the US and UK markets, but he could give no assurance that sales volumes would rise this year. Sales in Sweden, where new car registrations are at 1940s levels, were flat and the outlook in the rest of Europe was bleak. Mr Lars-Erik Forsgardh, the head of Aktiespararna, said Mr Gyllenhammar had satisfied 90 per cent of his questions. Background, Page 29</p>

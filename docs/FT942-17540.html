			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Scrip and the Revenue view I am just setting about my capital gains tax computation for 93/94 and am stuck on two issues: 1. The Inland Revenue approach to computing income and gains on disposal of shares acquired through enhanced scrip dividends. 2. The date of acquisition of shares acquired via a trust settlement. My father died in 1968, leaving shares in trust for me, with my mother receiving all income until she died in 1986. When did I 'acquire' them for CGT purposes? As 1982 saw a new 'base line' of capital gains established, I have been assuming that April 1982 is the date for indexing any gains from this trust settlement. 1. A scrip dividend which is sold straight away has to be shown in your tax return twice: first as income and then in the capital gains section. For income tax purposes, you will be treated as though you had been paid a dividend equal to 125 per cent of the market value of the scrip (on the quarter-up basis), and as though income tax had been deducted from that dividend at the rate of 20 per cent, broadly speaking. That notional income tax is not repayable, however. For CGT purposes, the scrip is treated broadly as though it were a rights issue, taken up at a price equal to its market value (on the quarter-up basis, as above). The calculation of the chargeable gain will, therefore, depend upon whether part (or the whole) of your original shareholding was acquired (or is deemed to have been acquired) before April 6 1982, for example. Ask your tax office for the free pamphlets CGT13 (The indexation allowance for quoted shares); CGT14 (Capital gains tax: an introduction); and CGT16 (Indexation allowance: disposals after April 5 1988). 2. On the bare facts outlined, you are deemed to have acquired the shares on the day of your mother's death at their market value (on the quarter-up basis) on that day. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

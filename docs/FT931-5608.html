			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Boeing lowers sights for new aircraft sales BOEING, the world's largest manufacturer of commercial jets, has reduced by 5 per cent its long-term forecast for new aircraft deliveries in its latest market outlook. But despite the industry's turmoil, Boeing expects world air travel and demand for new airliners to recover and show substantial growth by the end of the decade. In its annual study of the airliner market published today, Boeing forecasts new aircraft deliveries totalling more than 1,200 jets valued at Dollars 815bn over the next 18 years. This is 5 per cent less than the Dollars 857bn of new deliveries over the same period the Seattle-based company had forecast last year. The study shows that while aircraft deliveries totalling 789 jets worth Dollars 44.3bn remained at near-record levels last year, the combination of over-capacity, slow traffic growth and airline losses and financing difficulties led to a 6.6 per cent drop in new orders compared with 1991. Boeing said airlines ordered 482 aircraft worth Dollars 29.9bn last year compared with Dollars 32bn worth of orders in 1991 and as much as Dollars 71bn worth in 1990. All three big manufacturers - Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Airbus - also had cancellations and deferrals from financially strapped customers. This has led to sharp cuts in production and employment. Boeing is cutting output by 35 per cent and plans to shed 28,000 jobs over the next 18 months. After declining in 1991, air travel grew by 6.9 per cent last year. However, Mr Richard Albrecht, a Boeing executive vice-president, said much of this growth was the result of uneconomic air fares that produced continuing losses for many airlines. The recovery of the commercial aircraft business will hinge on a general improvement in the world economy and a return to profitable airline operations. Although airlines lost more than Dollars 10bn during the last three years, Boeing expects that larger airlines will now evolve as integration and consolidation continues. These larger airlines will have better control of their operations and, while the future airline market will still be competitive, Boeing believes it will be more stable. Air travel is expected to grow at an annual average rate of 5.4 per cent between now and 2010, according to Boeing. This growth will be led by the Asia-Pacific markets which are expected to account for over 40 per cent of growth over the next 18 years. Of the 12,000 or more new aircraft to be delivered between now and 2010, about 30 per cent will be needed to replace older and noisier jets. However, the rate of replacement of older jets has been slower than expected. Only 155 aircraft were retired last year, but Boeing says more than 750 were parked in the Arizona and California deserts at the end of last year. Boeing expects many of these parked aircraft will never return to service. The average aircraft size is also expected to continue to grow over the next 18 years from an average of 176 seats in 1980 to 193 seats in 1992 and to 227 seats in 2010. Boeing said its market share had not deteriorated in spite of changing competition. The Seattle group took 57 per cent of orders last year while Airbus won 29 per cent and McDonnell Douglas 11 per cent with other smaller manufacturers accounting for the remaining 3 per cent. Boeing's forecasts are roughly in line with those recently made by its two competitors. Airbus is estimating demand for 13,500 aircraft over the next 20 years while McDonnell Douglas has forecast a total requirement for 14,000 new jets during the same period.</p>

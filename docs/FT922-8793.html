			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (18): Guide for business visitors THE spectacular sight of Luanda bay, overlooked by a majestic Portuguese fort, blue sea lapping against the palm tree-lined marginale, ill-prepares the visitor about to land at a squalid airport, serving a decrepit city, surrounded by wretched shanty towns. But it need not be nearly as bad as it might at first seem. The heavy hand of an authoritarian government bureaucracy has been lifted. It is now a friendly bureaucracy. The once-elegant city is trying to pick itself up. Rubbish is being collected, several buildings are being renovated, bars and restaurants are reopening and if you have left anything behind, you can probably find it at the sprawling market known as the Roque Santeiro - but only go with an experienced guide. If you expect a taxi to be at the airport, you should have read this guide before leaving home. A handful of battered vehicles still ply the city streets but they're not usually to be found at the airport. Arrange to be met. The airport (Aeroporto 4 de Fevereiro) is about 4km from the city centre. There are no public telephones or banking services. If you are fortunate, you have a booking at the Presidente Meridien or the Tivoli, where you can be almost certain that there will always be water and power. Such is the demand, that even a booking does not always guarantee a room. Wherever you plan to stay, book well ahead; business is picking up. One of the first things to do on arrival is to make plans to leave, ie confirm your return booking. Changing your travel plans can be a tedious business: the national airline TAAG has a monopoly on ticket sales (excluding TAP flights). If you wish to fly to Addis Ababa, for example, go first to TAAG who will issue an order for the ticket. This must be presented at the bank for payment in foreign exchange. Then return to TAAG with the voucher and collect your ticket. Check in at least two hours before departure. Health precautions: yellow fever, cholera vaccination certificates are required; malaria prophylactics essential; drink only bottled water. No limit on cash or travellers cheques that may be taken in but if you expect to take back more than Dollars 5,000, a bank declaration must be completed for presentation at the airport. It is forbidden to export the local currency. Credit cards: American Express accepted at Presidente and Tivoli Hotels. Night spots: Espaco 93 for jazz or the discos Paralelo 2000 and Pandemonium. Excursions: Seek local advice, whether planning a local journey or going further afield - the security situation can change rapidly. Luanda itself can be dangerous. It is no longer necessary to carry a document authorising you to leave the city (Guia de Marcha) but take local advice about your route before travelling out of Luanda. One hour's drive south on the coast road gets you to the Cuanza River bridge (where Cuban foxholes are a melancholy reminder of the war); continue and the road will take you to Porto Amboim or drive north to Ambriz. Internal air travel: TAAG, the local airline, serves domestic routes but can be unreliable. DOING BUSINESS An experienced resident managing director of a foreign company offered this list of do's and don'ts: DON'T Forget that skills are at a premium: it is difficult to find a good secretary, let alone an office manager; Be discouraged by initial failures; Be put off by your first visit; Be put off by the present lack of raw materials and machines - this should ease as access to South African sources increases; Do business without a local partner. DO Hire a local Mr Fix It to help you through the bureaucracy; Be patient, flexible, and retain your sense of humour. The combination of obtaining a visa, getting from the airport to the city, securing accommodation, hiring a car and finding an interpreter can be the hardest part of the visit. All or part of these needs can be handled by the services department of the British company, Hull Blyth, which has operated in Angola for more than 150 years and has offices in Luanda, Lobito, Cabinda and elsewhere.

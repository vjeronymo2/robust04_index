			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NOTES  </P> <P> Imperial Corp. of America, the San Diego-based parent of Imperial Savings of  California, said it will announce a detailed restructuring plan soon, possibly  later this week. The plan is intended to put the savings and loan in compliance  with anticipated new capital requirements to be included in the congressional  S&amp;L bailout bill. For the past three years, Imperial has been diversifying  into non-traditional S&amp;L businesses, including "junk bond" investments and  loans on mobile homes and automobiles. But in January the company suspended its  dividend and halted asset growth at the insistence of regulators.  </P></p>

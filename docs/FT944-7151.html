			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil rallies following weakness in bank sector Share prices in Brazil staged a rally yesterday after a traumatic few days' trading which briefly saw the main Bovespa index down 12 per cent from a week ago. By yesterday's close the Bovespa had regained 4.1 per cent at 45,734, compared to its Monday opening of 47,124. Analysts said the market was worried by domestic factors, as well as the sell-off on global markets. The liquidation early in the week of two small banks and a higher than expected inflation figure for November both pointed to the fragility of the government's anti-inflation plan and the new Real currency. Analysts are also waiting for Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the president-elect, to announce his plans for privatisation and economic reforms to underpin the Real. Although the stock market is expected to do well under Mr Cardoso's presidency, uncertainty ahead of his January 1 inauguration has led to profit-taking. Since his election, when the Bovespa index hit 54,840, the market has fallen some 15 per cent. Even so, the index is still 21 per cent up since the Real's introduction on July 1. Among the constituents of the IFC's emerging markets index, Brazil has shown by far the best performance in dollar terms on the year to date, with a gain of more than 80 per cent. Mr Cardoso is not expected to make any significant announcements until the middle of next month. Markets may, therefore, remain nervous over the next few weeks, especially since some smaller banks are still rumoured to face liquidity problems. The new currency and a liquidity squeeze have seriously pressured some smaller financial institutions, and the central bank has liquidated seven banks since the Real's launch. Although these banks are small, the market is worried about the potential knock-on effect to bigger institutions, especially the financially troubled state banking sector. A central bank announcement, which said that it was slightly relaxing liquidity to support smaller banks, helped to lift sentiment yesterday. Mr Pedro Malan, the bank governor, also told senators that the financial markets were exaggerating the scale of the banking problems. However, at least five more small banks are thought to be experiencing liquidity problems or seeking help from the central bank.</p>

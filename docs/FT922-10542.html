			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / How turning away old customers can attract new business: Co-operative Bank launches its new 12-point ethical policy today TURNING AWAY customers may seem an unusual way to gain business, but for the Co- operative Bank it is an inevitable part of the ethical policy it launches today. The bank's 12-point code reflects its attitudes towards a number of business activities. The bank says it will not support, invest in or supply financial services to regimes, organisations and individuals involved in: The oppression of the human spirit, taking away the rights of individuals or manufacturing torture instruments. Providing weapons to countries with oppressive regimes. Cosmetics testing on animals. Exploitative factory-farming methods. Blood sports. Production of animal fur. Tobacco manufacturing. In addition, it says it will try to ensure that its services are not exploited for the purposes of money laundering, drug trafficking or tax evasion, and that it will encourage business customers to take an active stance on the environmental impact of their own activities. Such an aggressive position has its drawbacks. The bank has identified six existing customers which appear incompatible with these objectives, including five organisations involved in blood sports. All are likely to be asked to remove their business within the next three months. A sixth is a farm that derives a small proportion of its income from battery farming. The bank is already in discussions with the business, and hopes to persuade it to change its practices and remain a customer. The negative effects are likely to be minimal, however. The total value of these six accounts is about Pounds 100,000. Mr Terry Thomas, managing director, estimates that at worst it will lose one account for every 10 it gains. He says that since news of the ethical policy leaked last week, the bank has received 'hundreds' of calls and letters, only one of which was not supportive. One customer in the opened an account with a Pounds 60,000 deposit as a direct result. The Co-op has few large corporate customers, and only a handful of those are quoted. About 250,000 of its accounts are held by small and medium-sized businesses. The vast majority - about 1.25m - are personal customers, mainly individuals who appear strongly sympathetic with the policies. While the bank says it has always operated ethically, this is the first attempt to develop a formal written set of policies. The issues were selected after detailed market research including a questionnaire sent to 30,000 customers last November. Most of the respondents supported the code, with only 2 per cent strongly disagreeing. A total of 90 per cent of respondents said the most important issue to them was human rights, while 60 per cent said tobacco manufacturing was the issue they felt most strongly about. Any issue, such as nuclear power and the testing of drugs on animals, which less than 60 per cent of respondents felt was most important was not included in the final policy. What remains to be seen is how far the bank can effectively enforce its principles, and how many new customers will be sufficiently committed to ethical banking to switch their allegiance. 'There's no denying this is a marketing initiative,' says Mr Thomas. 'Why else do it? But we are not part of the long-haired sandal brigade. We are socially concerned bankers.' Mr Thomas emphasises that the ethical code is the second 'chapter' of its customer charter, launched last year. The first pledged that no financial information would be released to third parties without the customer's approval. The third will be a much more detailed statement on environmental policy.</p>

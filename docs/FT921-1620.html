			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (3): Facts to be appreciated before depreciation WHAT'S NEW IN ECONOMICS? edited by Jim Maloney Manchester University Press Pounds 40,326 pages FEW assets depreciate as fast as a book on new developments in economics. Even the economic journals are generally a year or two out of date by the time they are published. Keeping up to date with the latest research instead involves wading through vast mail-bags of working papers. Only a small band of the committed have either the time or the inclination to read all the new papers in any field. Much new research is, in any case, a new variation on a broader theme which evolves at a more gradual pace. The nine contributors to What's New In Economics? have done the donkey work on everyone else's behalf. Each essay covers a broad theme in economics - labour, industrial, international monetary economics, etc - and examines how research in that field has evolved over the past decade or so. Written for an economically-literate but non-mathematical audience, most of the essays are mercifully short on equations while not skimping on either graphs or references. Most of the fashionable subjects are covered: the application of game theory to industry, the 'micro-foundations' of macroeconomics, imperfect competition and international trade theory. Not all the chapters are complete: the discussion of labour economics, for example, appears to omit efficiency wages, perhaps the most important strand of labour research in recent years; while the macroeconomics chapter omits any reference to the blossoming new endogenous growth literature. All of the contributions would have benefited from a greater attention to empirical research. Overall, though, this book is well worth the effort. Read it soon; it will be out of date by Christmas.</p>

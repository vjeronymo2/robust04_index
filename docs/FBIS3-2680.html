			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 11 (XINHUA) -- China has drafted this  year's state budget according to the principle of tightening  control over expenditures so as to maintain a basic balance  between total supply and total demand and alleviate inflationary  pressure.    This remark was made today by Minister of Finance Liu  Zhongli  when he submitted his report on the implementation of the state  budget for 1993 and on the draft state budget for 1994 to the  ongoing session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC].    When analyzing the state financial situation, Liu said,  market demand will remain huge this year. While continued  reforms and economic development have created favorable  conditions for state finances, two years of high economic growth  have resulted in serious "bottlenecks," inflationary pressures,  and an acute shortage of funds, he said.    Under these circumstances, he said, China will continue to  strengthen and improve macro-controls, strive to improve the  economic performance of enterprises and make revenue increases  commensurate with economic development.    In expenditures, the country will act according to its  capacity, ensure investment in key state projects and exercise  strict control over investment in general fixed assets and  expenditures for consumption.    The finance minister said, in the implementation of the  state  budget for 1993, both revenues and expenditures exceeded  budgeted figures by a big margin. While revenue and  expenditures in local finances increased considerably in 1993,  those in the central finances failed to reach budgeted figures.  Moreover, although revenues in local finances increased  substantially, turnover tax revenues in central finances were  much less than the budgeted figure, thereby aggravating the  difficulties of central finances.    Total state revenues in 1993 came to 511.482 billion yuan  and  total state expenditures amounted to 531.982 billion yuan,  resulting in a deficit of 20.5 billion yuan. The deficit was  not in excess of the budgeted figure. Local budgets were  balanced.    The Ministry of Finance has adopted a different method for  calculating the deficit starting this year. Income from debts  will no longer be included in total revenues, and debt service  will no longer be included in total expenditures. Domestic and  foreign debts due for repayment will be serviced by issuing  treasury bonds. Such an adjustment only changes the way of  calculating the debt and will not affect the actual size of the  deficit.    The budget for 1994 shows that state revenue totals 475.995  billion yuan and expenditures amount to 542.914 billion yuan,  representing 7.7 percent and 15 percent increases over the 1993  figures respectively. This leaves a deficit of 66.919 billion  yuan, which reflects the real deficit.    If the deficit is added with 48.081 billion yuan for  servicing domestic and foreign debts and 14.245 billion yuan of  foreign loans to be invested in key state construction projects  this year, total debts for 1994 will come to 129.245 billion  yuan.    Liu explained that though China has appropriately reduced  investment in fixed assets, the high expenditures base for 1993  made it necessary to increase essential expenditures on  agriculture, education, science and technology and other key  areas. Total expenditures are also affected by wage increases  for employees of administrative departments and public  institutions, increased subsidies following the introduction of  a single exchange rate system and other policy related factors.  These factors altogether contributed more than 50 billion yuan  to total expenditures. In addition, because of price rises,  army wage reform and higher living expenses, this year's  national defence expenditures have been appropriately increased.    Liu noted that since the reform of finance and the taxation  system were put into force at the beginning of this year, the  experience of the past two months and more has shown that the  reform plan is correct, that it has been implemented smoothly by  and large and that no major problems have arisen. However, we  must remain sober-minded and be on our guard. The key to the  success of this reform lies in achieving a consensus of views  and in concerted action. Any problems can be reported to the  higher authorities. Financial and taxation departments at all  levels must take the interests of the whole into consideration,  and they should not go their own way, overstep their authority,  formulate their own rules and regulations, distort the reform  plan or lead the reform astray in implementation.</p>

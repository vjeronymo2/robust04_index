			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / The Week Ahead Results Due ANALYSTS ARE today expecting annual pre-tax profits of about Pounds 40m to Pounds 50m from Lucas Industries, the motor components and aerospace group, compared with Pounds 22.5m last time. This year's total will be enhanced by about Pounds 12m of disposal profits. Trading continues to be tough and some fear the dividend may be cut. Interim results to the end of August from natural cosmetics and toiletries retailer Body Shop on Thursday are expected to show pre-tax profits of Pounds 9m to Pounds 9.3m, against Pounds 8.3m last time. The UK is still likely to be depressed compared with a relatively good first half last year. The US contribution will be affected by currency translation, although stores in the region are expected to have traded well. Elsewhere sales growth is expected to have been sustained. A lower interest charge is also predicted. Highland Distilleries is expected to report full year pre-tax profits today of about Pounds 39m, including Pounds 10m from the change to equity accounting of its 35 per cent stake in Robertson &amp; Baxter, the whisky distiller. At the trading level, profits are likely to show a near 10 per cent increase to Pounds 24m with continuing benefits coming from Remy Cointreau's distribution of Highland's Famous Grouse whisky. Tomorrow St Ives, the UK's largest independent printer, is expected to report full-year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 22m, slightly ahead of last year's Pounds 21.1m. The results will be the first since Mr Miles Emley took over as chairman from Mr Robert Gavron.</p>

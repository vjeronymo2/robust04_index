			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAL ESTATE Q&amp;A: SELLERS NEED ALL THE HELP AN AGENT CAN GIVE THEM IN  TODAY'S MARKET  </P> <P> QUESTION: We are having trouble selling our home, which has been on the market  for almost nine months. The asking price is reasonable, based on an appraisal  of our home when we put it up for sale. We tried listing it with a real estate  agent, but she was totally incompetent, so we fired her after about 45 days.  </P> <P> Each weekend we hold an open house, which we advertise in the newspaper. Since  the location is good, we have lots of lookers, but have not had any offers so  far. My wife says we should wait to sell, but I want to get it over with, so we  can move by winter. Why doesn't our home sell?  </P> <P> ANSWER: Your home hasn't sold because you are doing everything wrong. It sounds  like you are just testing the market and are not highly motivated to sell  unless you get your price, which is based on a possibly outdated appraisal. By  trying to sell your home alone without a professional real estate agent you are  at a severe disadvantage.  </P> <P> Your first step should be to take down the "For Sale by Owner" sign. Look at  your house critically. Get it into tiptop condition. If it needs fixing up,  such as painting, cleaning and repairing, get the work done. New carpets and  fresh landscaping also can be very profitable.  </P> <P> The next step is to invite at least three real estate agents who have recently  sold homes in your neighborhood to inspect your home and give their listing  presentations. Each agent should give you a written "comparative market  analysis" form showing recent sales prices of similar nearby homes, asking  prices of comparable neighborhood homes now listed for sale (your competition)  and the agent's recommended price for your home.  </P> <P> Ask each agent for the names and phone numbers of their most recent home  sellers. Then phone those sellers to inquire if they were in any way unhappy  with the agent.  </P> <P> If you are serious about selling your home you need all the help you can get  from a professional agent. In the current buyer's market in most cities you  need the powerful multiple listing service to expose your home to as many  prospective buyers and other agents as possible. You only have one home to  sell, but it's hard to compete with the local multiple listing service, which  has hundreds of homes available and dozens of agent members.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Don't Use 'Over-55' Tax Break if Unneeded  </P> <P> Q: We just sold our condo and are overjoyed at finding a buyer after having it  on the market for sale almost six months. Our net profit is about $70,000,  including the deferred gain from the sale of our previous residence, which we  sold about six years ago. But we are receiving conflicting information on that  "over 55 rule" $125,000 tax break. As we are buying a townhouse which costs  just a little more than our condo's sales price, our tax man says we can roll  over our profit and not pay any tax on our sales profit. But a friend says we  should use the $125,000 exemption now because Congress might take that tax  break away. What do you advise?  </P> <P> A: If Congress takes away the "over-55 rule" $125,000 home sale tax exemption  every senator and member of congress would have the wrath of the powerful  American Assn. of Retired Persons (AARP) to contend with and would surely be  defeated at reelection time. This is one of the safest tax breaks and there is  no talk of abolishing it.  </P> <P> However, since you are buying a replacement principal residence of equal or  greater cost within 24 months before or after the sale of your old residence  you are eligible for the "roll-over residence replacement rule," IRC 1034,  which is available to home sellers of any age. Therefore, you can save your  once-per-lifetime $125,000 home sale exemption for future use. Your tax adviser  wisely suggested that you use this major tax deferral.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Oral Agreement in Sale Unenforceable  </P> <P> Q: We made a $5,000 deposit to buy a home. After some negotiation, we agreed on  the price and terms with the seller. We made it clear to our real estate agent  that if we can't afford the mortgage payments we will cancel the sale. She has  been unable to get us qualified for a fixed rate mortgage and we don't want one  of those adjustable mortgages, so we want to cancel and get our $5,000 back.  But the seller refuses to refund our money. He says there is nothing in our  purchase contract about being able to back out. But it was clearly agreed with  our agent we could get our money back if we couldn't get a mortgage. How can we  get our refund?  </P> <P> A: The Statute of Frauds requires binding contracts for the sale of real estate  to be in writing. If you had an unwritten "side agreement" with the agent it is  probably unenforceable because it was oral. Since a mortgage is available (but  not on terms you like), and you failed to put a mortgage finance contingency  clause in the written contract, you have several legal hurdles to overcome if  you sue the seller for a refund. Please consult a real estate attorney for  details.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Home Sale Can Provide Tax-Deferred Dollars  </P> <P> Q: We have about $75,000 equity in our home. Due to business debts, we must  sell our home to pay off about $50,000 of overdue bills. However, we understand  that if we are to avoid paying tax on our home sale profit we must buy a  replacement home of equal or greater cost. As we are not eligible for that  $125,000 "over 55 rule" exemption, is there any way out of our problem?  </P> <P> A: Yes. The "roll-over residence replacement rule" of Internal Revenue Code  1034 says you must defer your profit tax when selling your principal residence  and buying a replacement principal residence of equal or greater cost within 24  months before or after the sale.  </P> <P> Please notice this law says nothing about having to reinvest any cash received  from the sale into the replacement home. In other words, you can sell for all  cash and, if desired, buy a replacement home for nothing down such as by using  a VA mortgage.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Never Let Buyers Move In Before Close  </P> <P> Q: We recently sold our home and moved out.  </P> <P> As the buyers were moving from out of town, and their mortgage would take  several weeks to close, they talked us into letting them move into the house  before the title was transferred. When the time for closing finally arrived,  the buyers were about $5,000 short, so we had to make them a second mortgage  loan. In addition, they found numerous little defects in the house which were  trivial, but they got us to credit $2,000 for repairs. Our advice? Never let  buyers move into a home before the sale is recorded.  </P> <P> A: Thank you for that valuable advice. I fully agree.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FHA Lenders Will Not Strike Mortgage Policy  </P> <P> Q: Please unconfuse me about mortgage insurance. Several times you have written  about how to cancel mortgage insurance when the loan-to-value ratio drops below  80%. But when I wrote to my lender about canceling the insurance on my FHA  mortgage, I was told the lender's policy is to never cancel FHA insurance. My  loan is 14 years old and there is no need for such insurance, so my premium is  a waste of money. What can I do?  </P> <P> A: Sorry, there is nothing you can do to force your FHA lender to cancel your  MMI (mutual mortgage insurance) premium. Although I will get nasty letters from  FHA officials telling me FHA insurance can be canceled at the lender's  discretion, I have yet to hear of a lender foolish enough to do so. But the  good news is when you eventually pay off your FHA mortgage, you will become  entitled to a partial refund of the MMI premium you have paid.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, you confused your FHA insurance with PMI (private mortgage  insurance) which is required on 90% and 95% conventional mortgages. Depending  on the lender, PMI can usually be canceled when the loan balance drops below  80% of the property's market value. But most lenders require the loan to be at  least two years old before dropping the PMI.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Using MLS Can Be Breach of Agent's Duty  </P> <P> Q: We listed our home for sale with a realtor recommended by a friend. I don't  know much about real estate, but I do know the local realtors have a multiple  listing service to share information on listings. After several weeks we  noticed no agents from other brokerage offices had brought clients to inspect  our house. Upon inquiry with our realtor she said her firm usually can sell the  listings within its own offices, so there is no need to use the multiple  listing service. We thought our house would be in the multiple listing service.  What should we do?  </P> <P> A: Shame on your real estate agent for misleading you into thinking your home  would be submitted to the local multiple listing service. The MLS is one of the  most powerful sales devices real estate agents have and it is shocking your  agent isn't using it to get your home sold.  </P> <P> You should know the reason your agent didn't put your home into the MLS is the  agent and her broker earn a bigger commission if the sale takes place within  the listing firm. If you were told the MLS would be used, but it wasn't, the  agent breached her fiduciary duty to you. The matter should be reported to the  state real estate commissioner for investigation and possible revocation of the  agent's license.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Let Brokers Settle Their Own Disputes  </P> <P> Q: Several months ago we listed our home for sale with broker A. The listing  expired with the home unsold. Then we listed our home with broker B who found  us a buyer within a few weeks. We accepted the offer. Then broker A somehow  found out who the buyer was. She claims she showed our home to the buyer and is  entitled to half of the sales commission. But broker B says broker A is not  entitled to any part of the commission, since the first listing expired. Do you  think we owe half the sales commission to broker A?  </P> <P> A: Without reading the first listing and studying its "savings clause," I can't  tell if broker A is entitled to any part of the sales commission. A typical  "savings clause" in most listings says the listing broker is entitled to a  sales commission if, during the listing term, the broker registered with the  seller a prospective buyer who was shown the home during the listing term,  unless the home is subsequently listed with another real estate agent.  </P> <P> But smart home sellers stay out of sales commission disputes among real estate  agents. This is the nasty side of the realty sales business. Most agents can  settle their commission disputes through the arbitration procedure of the local  Board of Realtors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Home Warranty Can't Compensate All Losses  </P> <P> Q: We are preparing to list our home for sale. One realty agent suggests we pay  about $300 for a warranty policy to protect our buyer in case something goes  wrong with the house after the sale. But our home is only about three years old  and has no serious defects. Do you think we should buy a warranty policy?  </P> <P> A: One-year home warranty policies pay for repairs to the home plumbing,  wiring, furnace, water heater and built-in appliances. However, there are many  exclusions -- such as for the roof, foundation, plumbing outside the home's  perimeter, air conditioning and swimming pool -- unless an extra premium is  paid.  </P> <P> Home warranty policies are considered sales inducements. They also help protect  home sellers and real estate agents against claims from buyers for problems  that develop after the sale from covered losses. However, please don't think  these one-year home warranty policies protect buyers from every possible loss.  </P></p>

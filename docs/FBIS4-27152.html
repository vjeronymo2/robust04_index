			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 28 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam and  opposition Democratic Party (DP) chairman Yi Ki-taek met for the  second time this year Saturday, agreeing to hold summits often  and establish a partnership between ruling and opposition  parties to realize productive politics.    In talks that lasted some two and half hours, President Kim  held forth on the North Korean nuclear dispute, the issue of  North Koreans fleeing Siberian logging camps and the reality of  the situation up North, asking for the DP's cooperation in  diplomacy and inter-Korean issues.    Kim promised to instruct the government to fully cooperate  with the National Assembly' activities within the legal boundary  when the opposition leader called for the president's firm  action to resolve the currently deadlocked house probe into the  Sangmundae political scandal fund, presidential spokesman Chu  Ton-sik said.    The president explained that North Korea already changed  more  than half of its 8,000 nuclear fuel rods and that recent talks  with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) ended in failure.    He said it also was hard to predict what would happen to  talks between the United States and North Korea, slated for June.    "More than 90 percent of North Korea's arms are Russian made  and Russia automatically has to intervene when there is a war on  the Korean peninsula. I'm going to specifically address these  issues when I visit Russia," Kim said.    He added that Seoul informally proposed to offer some of its  reserve rice to North Korea to resolve its food shortages, but  the communist country refused.    The president urged the ruling and oppostion parties stop  wasting energy disputing and instead carry out partnership for  productive politics to raise national competitiveness, Chu said.    When Yi raised the issue of abolishing the National Security  Law, Kim said the subcommittee formed by lawmakers for the the  matter and legal experts should continue to discuss to reach a  good conclusion, contrast to the president's flat opposition to  the proposal in previous summit talks.    Explaining the inevitability of the birth of the world trade  organization and Uruguay Round [UR] agreement, Kim sought the  main opposition party's cooperation in the National Assembly's  ratification of the UR agreement.    Yi, however, firmly answered that his party opposes to house  ratification of the UR treaty.    When Yi called for a stop to inspections on Peace Foundation  chairman Kim Tae-chung's house, the president promptly said such  inspection activities could not be tolerated and should never  exist, recalling his experience in the past as a opposition  party leader.    After the talks, Yi announced that the president and he  reached agreements in the issues of Sanmundae probe, revision of  National Security Planning Law, investigation into Kwangju  uprising, revision of unified medical insurance law, and reforms  in educational and scientific policies.    "The president said North Korea had changed half of its  8,000  nuclear fuel rods and that the IAEA inspections had hit a  deadlock. Prospects for the third North Korea-U.S. talks were,  therefore, unclear and there was a possibility that the North  Korean nuclear issue could be referred to the UN security  council after hearing the IAEA report on its inspections," Yi  said.</p>

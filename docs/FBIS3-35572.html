The leader of the Islamic  revolution, Ayatollah Khamene'i, in an important message in  connection with the crime, described the painful catastrophe a  reminder of the mass murders carried out by the Zionists during  the occupation, saying that these crimes are now being committed  openly and before the eyes of the world people.    In part of his message, the leader of the Islamic revolution  said today: The bitter reality, that the oppressed Palestinian  nation is compelled to carry out a struggle on its own homeland  to be able to live there, has once again been dawned upon that  nation.    The leader of the Islamic revolution, then addressing the  world bodies and the governments, the so-called defenders of the  human rights that for years have ignored the human rights  violations of a nation in Palestine, posing the question as to  whether this time, too, these organizations will continue their  silence and whether those having forced peace with the usurper  enemy will realize their mistakes.    Yesterday's horrible crime committed at the Abraham mosque  in  Hebron is a shocking event which cannot easily be overlooked  and, as initial reaction, covered by the news reports of mass  media, show the dimensions of the crime are so widespread that  even the Western political circles and the supporters of the  Zionist regime have shown a negative reaction. In this  connection the U.S. State Department released a statement  yesterday strongly condemning the horrible and terrorist attack.  The U.S. administration in the statement, saying that the crime  stresses the need for expediting the Arab-Israeli talks, has  called on the two sides negotiating for the signing of the  compromising agreement between Palestine and Israel to continue  their talks. At the same time, France and Russia, through their  official stance in the world bodies, such as the Amnesty  International and the human rights organizations, in their  statements have condemned the crime and along with that the  leaders of the Islamic governments and organizations have also  strongly condemned the Zionist attacks against the Muslims.    What happened at Hebron yesterday has given rise to strong  reactions on a large scale and in the political circles and it  undoubtedly deserves condemnation. The Muslim government and  nation have great responsibility in following up to find who are  behind the crime. But from the political point of view what has  provoked the Western concern and the concern of the U.S. with  respect to the consequences of the horrible incident is the  impact that this can have on the future of the peace talks,  especially when nothing is clearly predictable as yet. Further  there are many questions posed with regard to the Muslim  reaction over the crime and Western political analysts cannot  easily find answers for these questions.</p>

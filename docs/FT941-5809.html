			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / S African leaders appear ready to seek international mediation Mr Nelson Mandela and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi appeared ready last night to seek international mediation to help break the political deadlock which threatens South Africa's all-race general election next month. The African National Congress announced it had accepted the proposal to call in mediators, made by Chief Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom party. Any appeal for United Nations assistance is expected to get a positive response from UN secretary general, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, who disclosed yesterday that he had written to the two leaders expressing 'delight' at the outcome of their meeting this week that paved the way to last night's development. President FW de Klerk, however, warned last night that he had 'serious reservations about international intervention at this stage'. The leader of the ruling National party told a meeting in Durban: 'We cannot afford further delays. The sudden lackadaisical approach, not realising the importance of the moment, does not impress me at all.' It was not clear whether he would actually block a move which, if successful, could ease the growing tensions in the country and ease the path to a successful poll. Chief Buthelezi is seeking what amounts to autonomy, if not full independence, for Natal, his party's stronghold. The ANC and the National party are prepared to concede Natal and other provincial assemblies limited powers. Mr de Klerk said in parliament on Wednesday he had not been consulted about an agreement on mediation between Mr Mandela's ANC and Chief Buthelezi. Details of the mediation proposal have not been agreed. The ANC has proposed a joint working group to 'address the specifics and agree upon mutually acceptable terms of reference'. The ANC statement said it would contact Inkatha to discuss possible further meetings between Mr Mandela and Chief Buthelezi. Leaders of the right-wing Freedom Alliance, a coalition of black and white parties including Inkatha, yesterday held out the prospect that they may today register for April's elections, reversing at least temporarily their decision to boycott the poll. Alliance leaders refused to be drawn publicly on whether or not they would register before today's midnight deadline. But they said privately that they would do so if Inkatha goes ahead with registration as promised earlier this week by Chief Buthelezi, and if the ANC accepts international mediation. The election is due to be held at the end of April. Fund managers watch cliffhanger with bated breath, Page 5</p>

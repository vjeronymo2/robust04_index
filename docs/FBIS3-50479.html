			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Panorama Newscast"] </F>   [Excerpts] The civilian population in San Cristobal de las  Casas, Ocosingo, Abasolo, Chanal del Carmen, and Las Margaritas  face an uncertain situation, fearing new surprise attacks by the  so-called Zapata National Liberation Army, which has declared a  war on the Mexican Army.    There are scenes of destruction and death today. Members of  the armed group are warning they will not remain entrenched.  They intend to advance to the central part of the state and the  country to demand the formation of what they call a free and  democratic government.    The most recent offensive launched by the armed group  resulted in the kidnapping of former Chiapas Governor General  Absalon Castellanos. Approximately 40 heavily armed men arrived  at his ranch in Margaritas municipality. There is still no clue  as to the whereabouts of Absalon Castellanos.    Today, the Mexican Army controls the city of San Cristobal  de  las Casas, which was suddenly abandoned by the rebels who tried  to storm the 31st Military Zone's general headquarters.  However, the action was successfully repelled by the Mexican  Army.    Clashes between the two sides in two days have left 57 dead.  The Red Cross has decided not to go into areas of conflict  given the lack of security for its humanitarian work. This  follows attacks on two Red Cross ambulances in San Cristobal de  las Casas, where a rescue team member was killed. The Red Cross  is warning it lacks medicine and the necessary material to  handle the emergency. [passage omitted]    The Judicial Police and the General Secretariat of  Protection  and Highways in Mexico City have launched a special security  operation which includes heightened security at government  facilities, media installations, and embassies. This is being  done as a precautionary measure to prevent any surprise takeover.</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Price-fixing deals on milk ruled out SEVEN leading dairy companies have given assurances to the Office of Fair Trading that they will not engage in restrictive practices to fix the price of doorstep milk or collude in tendering for milk supplies. This is believed to be the first time the OFT has sought voluntary undertakings from companies instead of referring them to the Restrictive Practices Court. The OFT said it wanted to avoid court proceedings because of the large costs involved. OFT inquiries begun in the early 1980s uncovered more than 150 illegal price-fixing agreements. The OFT said all the agreements had been terminated at least three years ago. The companies giving undertakings are Clifford Foods, Co-operative Wholesale Society, Co-operative Retail Services, Dale Farm Dairy Group, Healds Dairies, Unigate Dairies and William Stevenson. Similar undertakings are being negotiated with Associated Dairies and the National Dairymen's Association, a trade group. The OFT said the undertakings did not imply admission of wrongdoing because many agreements were made by subsidiaries before acquisition.</p>

			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EQUAL UPKEEP OF BLACK, WHITE GRAVES ORDERED  </P> <P> A rusty wire fence separating poorly tended graves for blacks from nicely kept  graves for whites must come down, says a judge, who also has ordered an end to  125 years of unequal upkeep in private Ryder Cemetery.  </P> <P> Weeds, trash and brambles have overrun the more than 200 black graves. For more  than 10 years, blacks willing to buy the $200 plots have been buried on the  well-tended side. But most blacks say they want to be buried near relatives on  the other side.  </P></p>

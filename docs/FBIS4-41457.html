			<p>BFN     [Text] On return from the United States on Saturday Russian  Prime- Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told Interfax that in the  States he had negotiated principled agreement on the elimination  of the discriminatory restrictions on bilateral trade.    Chernomyrdin was confident that the Jackson-Vanik amendment  would be declared null and void and that there was no chance for  the emergence of a new COCOM [Coordinating Committee for  Multilateral Export Controls] which jeopardized bilateral  relations by introducing restrictions on high tech trade. But,  Chernomyrdin said, the United States and Russia no longer showed  critical difference of views.    Nonetheless, he said, the Gore-Chernomyrdin commission was  planning to submit a few issues, for example, health care, to  the attention of the Russian and US presidents.    Chernomyrdin said that 22 Russian-US agreements and 4  agreements between Russia and the World Bank, including those on  loans and to the agrarian sector and banking system, for the  total worth of half a billion US dollars, were signed during his  visit to the United States. Chernomyrdin said  400-million-dollar deals were concluded for cooperation in outer  space. And, he said, the two countries had come very close to  the conclusion of another batch of space cooperation agreements,  for the total worth of 300 Mn dlrs.    Chernomyrdin compared his visit to the United States and  talks with President Clinton to Boris Yeltsin's visit to the  island of Corfu where a partnership and cooperation agreement  was signed between Russia and the European Union. In  Chernomyrdin's view, the Russian-EU agreement would help Russia  promote new relations with the European nations and belonged in  the packet of documents he signed in the United States.    Both President Yeltsin and the Russian government envisaged  the stage-by-stage incorporation of Russia into the European  Union, Chernomyrdin said. This stage called for Yeltsin's  participation in the political part of the G-7 summit, scheduled  to be held in July in Naples.    Chernomyrdin made special mention of his talks with the  General Motors Corporation which, he said, would like to  cooperate with Russia and launch joint projects with the VAZ and  ElAZ car plants. It was about time we stopped talking,  Chernomyrdin said, and switched over to practical action.    Chernomyrdin hoped that Monday's session of the government's  consultative investment council would enable Russia and its  western partners to replace negotiations with practical action.</p>

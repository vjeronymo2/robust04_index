			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / International Company News: Moody's downgrades NEC debt MOODY'S, the US credit rating agency, has downgraded the long-term debt rating of NEC, citing expectations that the Japanese electronics group's debt cover will deteriorate. The agency reduced its rating from A2 to A3. NEC, a leading manufacturer of telecommunications, computers and semiconductors, faces increasing competition in many of its markets, Moody's said. The group has seen the proportion of retained cash-flow to total debt fall to about half over the past several years, while interest cover has fallen from three times to about one and a half. The company is also forecasting a substantial loss in the year to March 1993, so interest cover will fall further. In the Japanese PC market, which NEC has dominated with its proprietary system, competition from US manufacturers is set to intensify with the spread of MS-Windows. This new operating system will loosen NEC's hold on the market by challenging the predominance of its Japanese-language software that has been maintained due to its propriety system. In addition, the company faces increasing price competition from US manufacturers, which will also erode its market share of over 50 per cent in Japan, Moody's says. In its semiconductor business, NEC is in a market where research and development and capital investment continues to rise rapidly with each new semiconductor generation, while profits from semiconductor sales continue to decline. Moody's has also downgraded NEC's short-term debt ratings and the rating of NEC Industries Netherlands from P-1 to P-2.</p>

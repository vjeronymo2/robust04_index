			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Havelock Pounds 3m funding to secure future HAVELOCK EUROPA, the lossmaking shopfitting company, is seeking to secure its future by a Pounds 2.97m placing and open offer and the building of a trading alliance with SAS Holdings, a private building systems supplier. At the same time, the Fife-based company announced a reduced interim pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 2.18m). Sir Lewis Robertson, the company doctor who became chairman when a new management was installed in 1989, also said he was retiring at the end of the year. Havelock is placing 10m shares at 31p, of which SAS is taking up to 1m, or 3.84 per cent of the increased equity. The open offer is on a 5-for-8 basis at the same price. The new shares will make up 38.46 per cent of the enlarged capital. The shares closed 1p lower at 35p. The money is needed for a restructuring necessitated by difficult trading conditions which have seen business in the group's traditional market fall by a third between 1989 and 1991, with a further decline expected in the present year. The programme will cut the cost base by Pounds 3.5m with asset write-offs and redundancy costs of Pounds 800,000 for which provision will be made in the second half. In the six months to June 30 turnover fell 8 per cent to Pounds 16m (Pounds 17.5m). The pre-tax figure was helped by lower exceptional costs of Pounds 61,000 (Pounds 490,000). There was no tax charge against a credit last time of Pounds 740,000 leaving losses per share higher at 10p (9p). The interim dividend is passed as there are no distributable reserves. On his departure Sir Lewis said that much had been achieved since he arrived and that the company was now firmly established. That allowed him time to spend on his other commitments. He will be replaced by Mr Norman Lessels, an existing board member.</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Attorney-general fights pressure to resign Sir Nicholas Lyell was last night fighting growing pressure to quit as attorney-general last night as Downing Street offered strong support and Conservative MPs attacked Mr Michael Heseltine's evidence to the Scott inquiry. Some Tory backbenchers said Mr Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, had 'gone over the top' in accusing Sir Nicholas of giving contradictory advice about his duty to sign public interest immunity certificates. Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, demanded Sir Nicholas's resignation during rowdy exchanges in the Commons over the government's involvement in the Matrix Churchill case, which collapsed after the judge accepted that the government had known about illegal arms deals. Mrs Beckett said Sir Nicholas's position was becoming 'increasingly untenable' as other ministers sought to 'save their own skins' by making him the scapegoat for the collapse of the trial. 'What sticks in the throat of the British public is that having secretly sold arms to Saddam Hussein which were used against British troops, ministers were prepared to see innocent men go to jail to cover up their conspiracy,' she said. Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons, who was standing in for the prime minister at question time, said Mr Heseltine had been advised 'quite properly' by the attorney-general. Downing Street also offered strong support to Sir Nicholas. He was said to have the 'full confidence' of Mr John Major, the prime minister, who is on a visit to the US. But the government's attempt to rally support for Sir Nicholas was undermined by Mr Major, who refused to comment until he had seen a transcript of Mr Heseltine's evidence. Conservative MPs said Sir Nicholas had been undermined by the evidence, but was unlikely to be forced to resign before Lord Justice Scott reports in the summer. But there was also widespread support for Mr Heseltine's disclosure that he resisted pressure to sign certificates because he feared that vital evidence in the Matrix Churchill arms for Iraq trial would be suppressed. Friends of Sir Nicholas said he was convinced he would be cleared by Lord Justice Scott, and was determined to resist resignation unless he was strongly criticised in the judge's final report. Sir Nicholas is expected to mount a strong defence of his advice to Mr Heseltine when he gives evidence to the inquiry on March 24. Some ministers would like Sir Nicholas to appear earlier, in order to limit the damage caused by Mr Heseltine's comments, but his appearance is unlikely to be brought forward.</p>

However, the new head of government is  confident that there is time enough to convince the Slovak  population of its work. It was not primarily a rejection of  former Prime Minister Meciar that united five former opposition  parties but, rather, a common political concept, Jozef Moravcik  pointed out.    [Moravcik] All five political parties see the need to  accelerate the process of economic transformation and to press  ahead with European integration. All five want to develop a  political culture that is based on the principles of democracy  adopted by the November revolution in 1989. This political  culture will help us in our communication with our partners in  Europe and on the other side of the Atlantic.    [Radzyner] In the sphere of domestic policies, these new  principles mean, above all, Slovakia's recognition as a society  with different ethnic groups, in which the members of the  Hungarian minority will become Slovak citizens with equal  rights. Still, Moravcik has not appointed a representative of  the Hungarian minority as a Cabinet member. Was he afraid of  Meciar? Meciar has already denounced the new government as the  traitor of the true interests of the true Slovaks.    [Moravcik] It is true that we took this into consideration.  After all, we do not want to trigger a new wave of nationalism.  This would be in contradiction with our political goals.    [Radzyner] Moravcik claims that he has excellent relations  with Czech Prime Minister Klaus, who was the last Czechoslovak  foreign minister. In Budapest, the new tones regarding the  Hungarian minority will certainly initiate good relations.</p>

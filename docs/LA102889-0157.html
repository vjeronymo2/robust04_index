			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LIFE ON THE CIRCUIT;  </P> <P> NEWPORT CENTER GOES MEDITERRANEAN;  </P> <P> THE SCENE  </P> <P> A wind-swept "Moon Over the Mediterranean" gala that celebrated Fashion Island  Newport Center's $100-million renovation. On Wednesday night, a few thousand  well-heeled guests swept along gleaming tile walkways, rhapsodized over new  fountains, explored new shops, and sipped, supped and swayed till the wee  hours, helping to chalk up more than $250,000 for seven local youth charities:  the Orange County Philharmonic Youth Programs, the Mardan Center of Educational  Therapy, the Irvine Theatre Children's Programs, the Orange County Bar  Foundation, Shortstop Program, Childhelp USA and the Irvine Children's Fund.  </P> <P> The Food  </P> <P> The Mediterranean never had it so good. Thymes caterers was faithful to the  theme, serving up 5,000 pounds of herb-seasoned beef and 1,000 pounds each of  grilled tuna and swordfish, not to mention bushels of pasta and enough  chocolate brownies to sink a yacht. Other highlights: three kinds of fresh  pears quartered and dipped into an apricot candied syrup, grilled, then served  with a zabaglione cream. Another mob pleaser: chicken marinated in pomegranate  juice (400 pomegranates were crushed to a pulp to pull this one off) and  seasoned with sage, garlic and thyme. The bubbly, served on silver trays, never  stopped flowing.  </P> <P> Quoted  </P> <P> "Newport Center has become a Mediterranean town," said billionaire Donald Bren,  chairman of the Irvine Co., which, along with The Times Orange County,  sponsored the benefit. "The climate here is the same as the Mediterranean's and  so is the architecture. This center exudes a radiance, an energy. It will  become a special way of life for everyone." His favorite shop? "I enjoy them  all," Bren said. His favorite restaurant? "I enjoy them all too."  </P> <P> Who Was There  </P> <P> Benefit chairpersons Sharon Sarvak, Joyce Gwidt, Ginny Hayward, Mary Ellen  Hadley, Judith Ryan and Mitzi Tonai, along with a herd of Irvine Co. heavy  hitters, a horde of Yuppies and a gaggle of socialites.  </P> <P> What They Wore  </P> <P> Bren sported a deep-burgundy tie with a supremely well-cut charcoal gray suit.  A white pocket square accented his ensemble. He also wore a golden-boy tan (we  hear he's taken up wind-surfing in Maui and on the Caribbean). The chairwomen  were dressed to kill, with Judy Ryan sporting a chic St. John knit jumpsuit and  Joyce Gwidt shielding herself against the nippy breezes in a suede coat she'd  purchased during a recent getaway in Italy. Thymes owner Janet Rosener proved a  walkie-talkie looks absolutely charming with figure-hugging black velvet. And  furs -- loads of them -- were flung over glittery party dresses.  </P> <P> Tender Moment  </P> <P> A parade of light was staged at 8:30 p.m., with dozens of children marching  along a paseo holding flashlights and passing out thank you notes to guests.  </P> <P> Overheard (over and over):  </P> <P> "Don Bren is here!" "Where?" "Over there!" "Ohhhh!" ANN CONWAY  </P></p>

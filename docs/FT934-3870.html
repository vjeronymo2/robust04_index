			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: API improves 41% despite depressed market segments Pre-tax profits at API, the packaging group, advanced 41 per cent from Pounds 3.85m to Pounds 5.41m in the year to October 2. The shares rose 8p to 358p. Turnover grew 18 per cent to Pounds 73.4m (Pounds 61.9m), said Mr Michael Smith, group chief executive, in a period when API's main 'geographical market segments were depressed and competition had become stiffer'. He added that the group was 'in a strong, healthy position', and in the future had 'a lot to go for' - the expansion of API's relatively small market shares, growth driven by new products, organic growth and further differentiation between existing products. Six months ago Mr Smith talked of the addition of a third leg within the packaging and office products area; that is 'still on the cards', and could either be a large acquisition for cash and shares - the group has net cash of Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 800,000) - or two or three smaller ones. Talks were continuing, he said. Mr Smith said that API had forged 'longer term alliances with key accounts', some up to three years and not fixed just on price. Both sides could reduce costs, with the customer being able to eliminate its quality control points. Group pre-tax margins were up from 6.2 to 7.4 per cent. In foils and laminates they rose from 6.8 to 8.1 per cent as operating profits grew to Pounds 3.62m (Pounds 2.52m) on turnover of Pounds 44.8m (Pounds 37m). In converted film and paper products, margins moved into double digits at 10.1 per cent, against 9.8 per cent. Operating profits rose to Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 2.03m) on turnover of Pounds 24.7m (Pounds 20.8m). Profits at the somewhat anomalous heating and ventilation side slipped to Pounds 208,000 (Pounds 230,000) on sales down at Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 4.2m). Earnings emerged at 16.85p (12.8p) per share after a tax charge up at 33.5 (29) per cent because of an improvement in US earnings. The final dividend is lifted to 4.9p (4.45p) for a total of 8.25p (7.5p).</p>

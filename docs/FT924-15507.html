			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Japan sees record trade surplus JAPAN recorded a current account surplus of Dollars 7.1bn (Pounds 4bn) in August, up 28.2 per cent on the previous August and the largest surplus ever recorded for the month. The surplus this year to August is Dollars 73.1bn, a rise of nearly 85 per cent against the same period last year. The rise in the surplus, combined with the stagnation of the domestic economy, is likely to intensify political infighting among the economic bureaucracy, industry and politicians over economic policy. The Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan will use the figures to support their argument that the yen should appreciate gradually against the US dollar to choke off the surplus. Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, vice minister for international affairs at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said a rate of Y118 to the dollar was appropriate, given the size of the surplus and Japan's low inflation record. The dollar closed in Tokyo slightly weaker at Y119.40. However the chorus of industrialists who complain that a stronger yen stifles export growth will use figures showing a marked deterioration in the labour market to justify their call for intervention to restrain the yen. The labour market figures show there are only just enough jobs being created to satisfy demand from people looking for work. Although the unemployment rate did not rise in August from July's 2.2 per cent, the introduction of recruitment freezes in most companies will push up unemployment in the months to come. The pressure for further government action to stimulate the economy, in addition to the Y10,700bn emergency package already announced, is focusing on calls for income tax cuts. But Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, yesterday rejected calls from some in the ruling Liberal Democratic party for tax cuts next year to be financed by a rise in consumption taxes. The sharp rise in the current account surplus from August last year was largely due to a 15.2 per cent increase in the trade balance to Dollars 9.5bn last month compared with the same month in 1991. This was a reflection of depressed demand for imports, which rose by only 0.4 per cent to Dollars 16bn and a rise in the value of exports. Export volumes fell by 3.5 per cent. But the strength of the yen against the dollar, which was 7.9 per cent down on its value in August last year, pushed up export prices to produce a 5.4 per cent rise to Dollars 25.5bn.</p>

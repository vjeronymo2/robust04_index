			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / International Company News: Profits climb at Sophus Berendsen SOPHUS Berendsen, the Danish conglomerate that controls the UK pest control group Rentokil, increased pre-tax profits by 18.6 per cent to about DKr1.2bn (Dollars 194m) for 1992, writes Xueling Lin in Copenhagen. Turnover was significantly affected by the strength of the Danish krone. Sales rose 4.2 per cent to DKr7.4bn. At 1991 year-end exchange rates, turnover would have been DKr8bn, an increase of 13 per cent on the previous year. Mr Hans Werdelin, chief executive, added that Rentokil group sales increased by 19.8 per cent to Pounds 465m (Dollars 702m), but translated into kroner the increase was only 2.7 per cent, to DKr4.4bn. Earlier this month the Danish group took over the fluid power division of Lucas Industries in Canada.</p>

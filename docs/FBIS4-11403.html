			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Atilio Bleta; Copyrighted by CLARIN] </F>   [Text] There is a strange mixture within the Grand Front of  happiness over the 10 April elections and a fear of being unable  to respond to the favorable expectations that emerged from part  of society.    The happiness results from more than 2 million votes (nearly  four times as many as in the previous election) for this  alliance nationwide, victory with a 13 point lead in the Federal  Capital, nearly 1 million votes in Buenos Aires Province, 29.2  percent in Neuquen Province (in October 1993 it only obtained  1.9 percent), and progress in Entre Rios Province (up from 2.4  to 12.4 percent), Chaco Province (up from 0.4 to 5.4 percent),  Tierra del Fuego Province (up from 1.6 to 5.1 percent), Santa Fe  Province (up from 1.3 to 10.2 percent), and Cordoba Province (up  from 0.3 to 5.7 percent).    There are also reasons for concern because within the next  few months the center-left alliance must become  institutionalized, make itself felt throughout the country,  resolve its policy regarding alliances, and devise an  alternative to the government's program.    The Grand Front was born a year ago from the Union of the  South, headed by Fernando "Pino" Solanas, (which obtained 8  percent of the vote in the election for senator for the Federal  Capital in 1992), and the Fredejuso [Front for Democracy and  Social Justice], headed by Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez.    Following the good results obtained on 3 October, the Front  began a regrouping process, seeking to become something more  than a group of "parties in disuse," according to Alvarez'  definition.    [Christian Democrat Deputy] Carlos Auyero's preaching  convinced several parties (Democratic and Popular Left, Popular  Intransigence, and 29 May Movement) to create a new party called  The New Progressive Opening [Nuevo Espacio Progresista].    Alvarez' influence convinced the Fredejuso (where dissident  Peronists, two factions of the Intransigent Party, Popular  Protagonism, and a communist splinter group coexist) to function  as a political party.    The Front also includes another Peronist splinter group, the  Southern Proposal that is headed by Pino Solanas, the Popular  Encounter (principally made up of Peronist dissidents headed by  Luis Brunatti), the Communist Party, and the so-called "social  opening" which operates through unions and other intermediate  organizations.    For the 10 April elections, this alliance was able to speak  about the Front and not the parties that make it up. The  national board on 14 April decided to expedite the  institutionalization process and support "a new and prevailing  identity" because they know "they cannot continue the way they  are."    The leaders want the Front to become a political party with  legal status, a program, and a system for electing candidates,  which could well be through open internal elections.    Different aspects must be considered when implementing the  reorganization:    Chaco Alvarez and those who support him believe the new  identity must be obtained when the program and the tactics for  1995 are discussed. They do not like the thought of  institutionalizing factions because they say it would be like  "fencing in dissidence."    Auyero and Graciela Fernandez Meijide prefer to function as  a  single party with the people of Alvarez and Solanas in order to  form the leadership of the alliance.    Brunatti is also betting on consolidating the Front as a  party, but he views the strong internal currents coexisting  within it.    The Communist Party is projecting its transformation into a  "new political force" in order to use "everything" to favor the  Front.    The institutional space required by social organizations  must  also be resolved. Unionists Mary Sanchez (CTERA [Confederation  of Education Workers of the Argentine Republic]-Buenos Aires)  and Alberto Piccinini (UOM [Metalworkers Union]-Santa Fe  Province) were elected on 10 April as members of the Constituent  Assembly.    The Front's national board resolved to postpone the debate  regarding candidacies until the institutionalization facet is  over, although Chacho Alvarez and Pino Solanas are tipped to  head the presidential slate.</p>

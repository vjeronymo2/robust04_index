			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Lotus returns to the black with Pounds 2m Group Lotus, the UK sports car maker and engineering group taken over last year from General Motors by Bugatti International of Italy, yesterday announced its return to profitability after an extended period of losses under GM ownership. The company, which currently employs 950 people at its Hethel, Norfolk, operations, is now on course to fund a new small sports car planned for 1996 from its own resources after achieving a Pounds 12.3m turn-round to record an unaudited net profit of Pounds 2m, Mr Adrian Palmer, managing director, said last night. Bugatti bought Lotus from GM for a reputed Pounds 30m and said as recently as June that it intended to raise more than Pounds 100m to fund Bugatti and Lotus development through a flotation on the New York Stock Exchange. So far, this has not been proceeded with and Mr Palmer said yesterday that Lotus would now need additional funding only for a larger sports model also being planned for the late 1990s. Lotus's transition to profit from a Pounds 10.3m net loss in its financial year to August was based on turnover 22 per cent higher at Pounds 50.8m. Sales of the Esprit, its large sports car, rose 45 per cent from 246 units to 360, and 84 Elan small sports cars were sold after the resumption of production earlier this year. While Lotus plans to build a similar number of Esprits in the current year, it is scheduled to build a total of 800 Elans by mid-1995 as a limited production run, after which it will be preparing to produce the new small sports car. This, too, is scheduled for output of 800 units a year starting in early 1996. However the bulk of Lotus's turnover - about 60 per cent - came last year from engineering consultancy work. This rose 7 per cent in value to Pounds 25.1m and Pounds 43m of new orders have been received in the past 12 months, said Mr Palmer.</p>

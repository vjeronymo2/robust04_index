			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): French poll adds to continental gloom A POLL indicating that France could scupper the Maastricht Treaty added to the gloom on continental bourses, writes our Markets Staff. PARIS opened the new account slightly firmer, supported by an uptick in the bond market. But trading became increasingly volatile following the release of the first poll to show a majority of French voters, albeit a narrow 51 per cent, would reject the Maastricht Treaty. The CAC-40 index fell as low as 1,640.94 before closing down 21.99 at 1,667.72 in turnover of FFr2.08bn. Polls published later in the day were narrowly in favour of Maastricht. Dealers said many blue chips were being swayed by the heavy arbitrage between the cash and futures market. LVMH descended to FFr3,481 before ending up FFr6 at FFr3,588 while UAP recovered from FFr330 to close FFr12.50 down at 344.40. But they also witnessed genuine selling by fund managers wanting to lighten their positions in France, especially in shares which looked vulnerable from a technical point of view. The biggest faller was Poliet which went limit down on its first trading day in its new form, on news that Paribas had been left with 70 per cent of the building materials company. The stock ended FFr35 or 11.9 per cent down at FFr260 with just 6,625 shares traded. Elf drew some comfort from its interim results, announced after the close on Monday, losing FFr2.10 to FFr307.70. FRANKFURT closed at its lowest level since February 1991 as the DAX index shed 29.83 or 2 per cent to 1,468.91 after a midsession fall in the FAZ index of 10.27 to 583.01. Turnover rose to DM4.1bn from DM3.9bn on Monday. There was agreement among analysts that the market was locked into a negative mood and was not responding to any good news. Linde, which reported an increase in first half pre-tax profits after the close on Monday and forecast improved full-year earnings, lost DM21 or 3 per cent to DM688. Bayer's interim results, which were also better than anticipated, failed to make a bigger impact: while its shares traded up DM1.90 in the pre bourse, they closed down 10 pfg at DM255.70. Other chemical stocks lost ground ahead of their results: Hoechst, reporting today, shed DM3.80 to DM228 and BASF fell DM2.70 to DM211.20. Metallgesellschaft saw one of the steepest falls of the day, down DM20.20 or 6.6 per cent to DM286.50, mainly due to the weak dollar. MILAN fell further as the lira weakened and fears that smaller brokers were in trouble persisted in the market. 'We are being attacked on all fronts,' said one dealer. The Comit index fell 5.13 to 394.93 in turnover estimated at L40bn after Monday's thin L38.2bn. The mark was fixed at a new record high of L764.25 at the fixing, and the Bank of Italy was forced to intervene in support of the lira. ZURICH lost ground but was more resilient than other markets. The SMI index fell 18.2 to 1,709.7 in moderate turnover. Ciba-Geigy bearers managed a better day than most, falling SFr2 to SFr624 as sentiment remained positive after last week's results. AMSTERDAM resisted a steep fall with the CBS Tendency index losing 0.9 to 106.9. Dollar-sensitive stocks saw some of the steepest declines with Unilever Fl 2.30 weaker at Fl 176.60, Akzo dropping Fl 1.30 to Fl 142.00 and Elsevier shedding Fl 2.90 to Fl 104.10. Pakhoed and Van Ommeren, the storage and transport groups, fell heavily after reporting disappointing half-year figures. Pakhoed lost Fl 3.20 or 8.6 per cent to Fl 34.00 while Van Ommeren tumbled Fl 2.90 or 8.4 per cent to Fl 31.50. KNP, the paper manufacturer, rose 30 cents to Fl 37.00 ahead of today's first-half results. Another highlight was Hagemeyer, the trading group, up Fl 4.00 or 3 per cent at Fl 129.50 on a 25 per cent increase in earnings for the first six months. STOCKHOLM continued to slide as domestic interest rates kept climbing. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 17.9 or 2.4 per cent to 732.3 in moderate turnover of SKr483m. Astra's stronger-than-expected half-year results came too late to support its shares. The B shares dropped SKr13 to SKr484. OSLO fell on uncertainty over the fate of Uni Storebrand and high Norwegian interest rates. The all-share index closed 5.16 lower at 300.04 in turnover of some NKr285m. HELSINKI was burdened by falling forestry shares. The sector's index fell 8.3 per cent on a pessimistic forecast for the industry while the HEX index lost 4.5 per cent to a new low of 579.8. BRUSSELS's Bel-20 index lost 16.70 or 1.5 per cent to 1,068.42 in turnover of BFr1.1bn. Electrabel gained BFr20 to BFr4,810. MADRID's general index fell 1.94 to 205.66 in turnover estimated at a low Pta5.6bn. Vallehermoso, the property group, lost a further Pta50 or 5.5 per cent to Pta850, after touching an intraday year's low of Pta811.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - AUG 25  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Open  10.30am    11 am   12 pm     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm    close 1009.52  1005.03  1000.17  995.08   996.98   999.28   997.97   993.01  -----------------------------------------------------------------------             Day's High  1009.52    Day's Low  993.01  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Aug 24    Aug 21    Aug 20    Aug 19    Aug 18 1010.52   1039.54   1030.83   1033.91   1035.74  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

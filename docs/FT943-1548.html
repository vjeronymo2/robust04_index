			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: New supermarkets help Morrison advance 24% Wm Morrison Supermarkets, the regional superstore group, shrugged off intense price competition in the grocery market and beat expectations with a 24 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 38.2m to Pounds 47.4m. The improvement was driven by a 15.2 per cent increase in takings, in spite of what Mr Ken Morrison, chairman, called the 'growing tendency for the consumer to seek improved value and lower prices in all purchases', and deflation in many product areas. Like-for-like sales, which exclude new store openings, increased 4.4 per cent, although the rate of increase had slowed in the second half. 'Trading at the moment remains keenly competitive with ever present pressure on profit margins,' Mr Morrison said. He added that sales had been boosted by the legalisation of Sunday opening, but 'the profitability of this development has not yet been confirmed'. Five new stores opened during the first half, with a further two so far in the second half, and one more opening due this year. Morrison is planning to open 10 stores next year, and has begun a refurbishment programme of older stores. It has secured a Pounds 150m revolving credit facility to finance future expansion plans. Total turnover in the half year to July 31 increased 15.4 per cent from Pounds 746.5m to Pounds 861.8m. The increase in sales was backed by an improvement in gross margins through better buying, and a fall in wage costs. That enabled the group to report a 24 per cent increase in operating profit, from Pounds 39.1m to Pounds 48.5m, representing an increase in operating margin from 5.2 per cent to 5.6 per cent. Interest receivable was higher than expected at Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 1m). The interim dividend is 0.24p, a 20 per cent increase on last year's 0.2p, with earnings per share increasing 19.8 per cent from 3.38p to 4.05p. COMMENT It is tempting to ask how Morrison does it. In what the chairman describes as 'undoubtedly a buyer's market' it has increased its gross margin 0.4 points, reduced costs, and achieved a 15 per cent sales increase. Like-for-like sales growth has slowed in the second half, but new store openings are likely to keep total sales growth healthy, and the gross margin is expected to be held or improve slightly. With full-year forecasts upgraded yesterday to about Pounds 117m, the shares are on a prospective multiple of 14.4, almost on the market rating. Some might think earnings prospects could justify a small premium to the market.</p>

(``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On January 4, 1994, the Amex amended the filing to request that the pilot program for its After-Hours Trading facility be extended for a three-month period, until April 30, 1994, while the Commission considers the Exchange's request for permanent approval of the pilot program. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1991). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As originally filed, File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;93&hyph;15 requested permanent approval of Amex's pilot After-Hours Trading facility. On January 4, 1994, the Amex amended the filing with an additional request for a three-month extension of the pilot in order to give the Commission adequate time to consider the request for permanent approval and requested that the extension be granted accelerated approval.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  letter from William Floyd-Jones, Jr., Amex, to Sandra Sciole, Special Counsel, Commission, dated December 23, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange proposes to extend its pilot After-Hours Trading (``AHT'') facility through April 30, 1994. The current pilot program was scheduled to expire on January 31, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange requests accelerated approval of the proposed rule change. The Exchange believes that accelerated effectiveness is appropriate since it would permit the Exchange's existing AHT facility to continue operating while the Commission considers permanent approval of the facility. The proposal to extend the AHT pilot, therefore, does not raise any new questions for the commission's consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II.

The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item III below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A.

Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In August 1991, the Commission partially approved the Exchange's AHT facility on a temporary basis. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  This facility permits the execution of coupled and single-sided closing price orders after the close of the 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. trading session. Commencing at 4:15 p.m., single-sided round lot orders for equity securities can be entered through the Exchange's PER system or left with the specialist or the specialist's authorized representative for matching and execution at 5 p.m. at the Exchange's last closing regular way price. Coupled buy and sell round lot, odd lot and partial round lot orders also can be entered through the PER system, or left with the specialist for execution at 5 p.m. against each other at the Exchange's last regular way price. Members are permitted to designate good `til cancelled (``GTC'') limit orders entered during the regular trading session as eligible for execution in the AHT session. Such orders are marked ``GTX'' and migrate to the AHT facility for possible execution. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29515 (August 2, 1991), 56 FR 37736 (August 8, 1991) (order approving File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;91&hyph;15) (Amex AHT Approval Order). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission notes that the Amex's AHT facility enables members, not including specialists, to enter both proprietary and agency orders in any Exchange traded equity security, including stocks, rights, warrants, primes and scores, ADRs, and non-option equity derivative products, for execution at the Exchange's last closing regular way price. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

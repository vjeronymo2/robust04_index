			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: The Week Ahead WH Smith, the retail and distribution group announces figures to the end of November on Wednesday. Losses in Do It All, its do-it-yourself joint venture with Boots, will drag profits lower, from Pounds 50.1m to about Pounds 45m pre-tax, say analysts, including the pension credit Smith enjoys. The January sales are critical for MFI Furniture Group, the kitchen and bedroom retailer which floated last summer and which reports for the first time in its new form on Thursday. Although last year's January sales were strong, brokers think MFI could have beaten the numbers this year. As for the interim figures, to November 7, brokers are in the dark without comparable figures. Estimates are for a fall in operating profits from Pounds 24.2m to around Pounds 18m to Pounds 20m. Misys, the acquisitive computing services group led by a former Hanson executive, Kevin Lomax, is due to report its interim results on Thursday. Pre-tax profits are expected to increase to around Pounds 6.3m from Pounds 3.59m a year earlier. The group has made a spectacular recovery since its disastrous 1990/1 financial year when its shares bottomed at 63p. They now stand at 375p. Unitech, the international electronics group, is still bearing the scars of the slowdown in the Japanese economy. The company, which ranks as the world's largest manufacturer of power supplies for electronic equipment, is likely to report a decline in first half pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.1m from Pounds 7.8m in the comparable period.</p>

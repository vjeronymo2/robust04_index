			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / World Bond Markets: London This week could prove to be highly volatile for gilts, as the markets prepare for a spate of crucial UK data and digest the knock-on effects of last week's turbulence on the US bond markets. The key domestic figures will be the retail prices index and average earnings data on Wednesday. Most analysts expect these to boost gilts by confirming that UK inflationary pressures remain relatively low. 'I think the average earnings data will show that there has been a change in psychology,' says Mr Nigel Richardson of Yamaichi International. He argues that the low inflation outlook is making gilts increasingly attractive to UK institutional investors and that they are likely to outperform US and German bond markets in the coming weeks. Nevertheless, as Mr Jonathon Loynes, of Midland Global Markets, points out, UK gilts could still be depressed by international bond market turbulence, particularly from the US, which is exerting more of an influence on gilts than Germany. A higher than expected US producer prices index last Friday revived concern about US inflation and temporarily knocked up to 1 3/4 points off long-dated gilts. Some analysts warn that this could be repeated if Tuesday's US consumer prices index is also high.</p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Italian parties in the red ITALY'S political parties have emerged as rich men in beggar's clothing from the publication of their annual accounts. According to the formal accounts of the 14 main parties published yesterday in the official gazette, their combined revenues added up to only L285bn (Pounds 122m) in 1991 against declared expenses of L293bn. However, their accumulated debts at the end of 1991 totalled L108bn. The accounts have been published after having been sent back to the respective party treasurers for clarification in the light of the current corruption scandals. Even so, they differ widely from the picture being made public by businessmen and state company managers who have admitted to paying bribes and illicit contributions to the parties over recent years. On the basis of these confessions and the generalised nature of illicit party funding known to exist, official contributions in 1991 would appear to represent little more than 10 per cent of the real monies collected in the parties' names. Illicit funding of overblown party infrastructures and lavish spending lies at the heart of the magistrates' investigations into corruption. In theory, all contributions over L5m have to be declared, yet very few such contributions are listed. Another senior member of the Fiat group has been caught up in the corruption investigations. Yesterday magistrates revealed that a cautionary warrant alleging corruption had been issued against Mr Riccardo Ruggeri, the London-based chief executive of New Holland, the agricultural machinery concern.</p>

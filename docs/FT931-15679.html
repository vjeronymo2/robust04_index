			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Perot's return fires talk of White House ambition MR ROSS PEROT yesterday relaunched his grassroots national political organisation, United We Stand America, by inviting anybody willing to pay Dollars 15 to sign up as a member. Just 10 weeks after capturing the votes of nearly one in five Americans as the independent candidate in the presidential election, the Texas billionaire said the organisation's aim was closely to monitor the performance of the new administration and Congress in cutting the budget deficit and improving the nation's economic and social infrastructure. Mr Perot has adopted a low profile since November but his Dallas press conference yesterday marked the start of a round of television talk shows, and which will inevitably revive talk about his ambitions for 1996. He insisted the organisation would remain non-partisan. However, a US syndicated newspaper column yesterday raised the possibility that Mr Perot could contest the 1996 election on the Republican ticket. The Evans and Novak article, admittedly speculative, noted a recent meeting in Philadelphia between Mr Perot, Mr Robert Dole, the Senate minority leader, and Senator Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican, during which Mr Perot spoke of 'revitalising' the opposition party. 'Since another third-party Perot run for president would scarcely revitalise the GOP,' the columnists wrote, 'the inference from the meeting is that the lifelong political independent from Texas might don Republican colours'. Mr Perot and Senator Dole are on reasonably good terms. Mr Dole is also engaged in a struggle for hegemony in the Republican party, particularly against the group of 'bleeding heart' conservatives led by Mr Jack Kemp, the outgoing housing secretary with naked presidential ambitions. Mr Kemp, along with Mr William Bennett, the former education secretary, and Mr Vin Weber, who resigned as a congressman last year, will today set up a political organisation designed, in part, to appeal to Perot voters. Mr Bennett told Evans and Novak: 'We should ignore him and go for his people.' Mr Perot, whose animosity towards President George Bush was conspicuous last year, yesterday declined to speculate on his longer term plans. He was, however, critical of the nomination of Mr Ron Brown as commerce secretary because of his career as a lobbyist. Mr Brown might be 'a fine man,' he said, but he represented all 'we know to be wrong' in Washington.</p>

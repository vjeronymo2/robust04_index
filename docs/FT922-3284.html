			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Tiny chip packs a mean punch Memory chips produced early in the next century will be able to store more than 4bn bits of information - that's 250 times greater in storage capacity than today's biggest chips. The sweeping pace of miniaturisation, along with reductions in the cost of computer power, has led IBM research scientists in Yorktown Heights, New York, to build the world's smallest transistor. Using electron-beam nanolithography fabrication techniques the chip's active area measures just 1/75,000th of the cross section of a human hair. Previously, the smallest transistor in existence was 20 times larger in area. And, according to the researchers, these new transistors can be reduced further in size by a factor of two.

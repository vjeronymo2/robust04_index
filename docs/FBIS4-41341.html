			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "NEGA Reports" rubric: </F> "Bashkortostan"]    [Text] Speaking at the current Supreme Soviet session,  Bashkortostan Prime Minister Anatoliy Koptsev pointed out that  the recent signing of agreements between the republic and the  Russian Federation gives Bashkortostan independence in solving  numerous problems and helps the Russian Government realize the  need to give broader rights to the regions. In the  Bashkortostan prime minister's view, the main thing today is to  devise a mechanism for putting the agreements into practice.  The 10 agreements that deal mostly with economic matters are  the result of two years' hard work. The documents cover  environmental protection, power-sharing with regard to  state-owned property, customs matters, and international and  economic relations. From now on the republic will take over  control of the activity of the fuel and energy sector on its  territory and will form its currency and gold reserves on its  own. However, agreements on the budget and relations with the  Russian Central Bank have yet to be signed. A group of  officials from the Russian Finance Ministry currently visiting  Ufa is studying the problem.</p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Money Markets: Rates creep higher RATES IN the UK money market moved higher yesterday as traders held back paper in anticipation of a large end-of-month shortage today. As usual, a large shortage was anticipated on the last day of the month, as banks carry out particularly large payments to the Bank of England on behalf of clients. That shortage will be compounded this time by the large Pounds 2.5bn gilt auction launched by the Treasury yesterday. Discount houses were therefore anticipating a rise in rates today and limited their trading with the Bank of England. 'People are not selling paper today, thinking that they will get better value tomorrow,' said Mr John Trimming of Union Discount. As a result, short-term period rates ended slightly higher in the interbank market. One month rates ended at 10 3/4 - 5/8 per cent, about  1/16 up on the previous day's close. The overnight rate also closed at 10 7/8 - 3/4 per cent, having gone over 11 per cent at several points of the day. Dealers said that the one-week rate was also up, ending at 10 3/4 - 5/8 per cent, about  1/8 higher on the previous day's close. In the discount market, the Bank of England forecast a shortage of around Pounds 700m, and in early operations purchased Pounds 2m of Band-1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent, Pounds 16m of Band-3 bank bills at 10 5/32 - 1/8 per cent and Pounds 24m of Band-4 bank bills at 10 1/16 - 1/32 per cent. The forecast was revised to around Pounds 850m before taking account of the early operations. The Bank purchased Pounds 8m of Band-1 bills at 10 3/8 per cent, Pounds 11m of Band-2 bills at 10 3/8 per cent, Pounds 5m of Band-3 LA bills at 10 1/8 per cent, Pounds 56m of Band-3 bills at 10 1/8 per cent and Pounds 131m of Band-4 bills at 10 1/32 per cent. The forecast was again revised to Pounds 950m. In the afternoon the Bank purchased Pounds 226m of Band-1 bills at 10 3/8 per cent and Pounds 4m of Band-4 bills at 10 1/32 per cent. The Bank then provided late assistance of around Pounds 360m. In Germany, call money rates fell to 9.60-65 per cent from 9.60-70 per cent after monthly pension payouts were returned to the banking system. One trader said that month-end liquidity was now adequate. There was no regular securities purchase offered by the Bundesbank and the next one is due on May 6.</p>

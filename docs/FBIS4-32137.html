			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Miroslava Belcheva: "Union of Democratic Forces </F> Parliamentary Group Demanded Resignations of Three of Its  Leaders"]    [Text] Public demands were made for the resignations of  Filip Dimitrov, Svobodka Stefanova, and Edvin Sugarev from the  SDS [Union of Democratic Forces] parliamentary group, following  a meeting of the group, the scandalous proceedings of which  leaked out at the trolleybus stop near the National Assembly.  Sugarev justified himself, casting the blame on the group,  which in his view was committing suicide. In a shocking  interview given to a Sofia newspaper, Svobodka Stefanova made  defamatory statements against Stefan Savov, Georgi Petrov,  Mikhail Nedelchev, and Vesela Rasheeva, accusing them of  plotting to discredit others and making offensive  generalizations about their past and standard of education.  Edvin Sugarev emotionally defended her. This prompted Petrov  and Rasheeva yesterday to demand the expulsion of Stefanova and  Sugarev from the SDS parliamentary group. In the lobbies of  parliament, Stefan Savov asked Georgi Petrov to withdraw his own  resignation.    However, the issue did not come to a vote at the meeting.  Aleksandur Yordanov appealed for personal disputes to be  settled, even by expulsion if necessary.    According to Rasheeva, the SDS will not disintegrate just  now, but the sharp decline in its image makes it pointless to  "stand together."    SDS Deputy Romil Popov declared that it was high time for  Filip Dimitrov to resign. He angrily stated that Dimitrov was  to blame for everything. He allowed people like Ludzhev and  Michkovski to leave the coalition, handed over the power held by  the SDS without the parliamentary group deciding to do this,  provoked splits in the SDS member parties, and even permitted  his own cronies like Vasil Mikhaylov and Edvin Sugarev to spread  slanders. Popov said that for a year now he had been  campaigning to remove Filip Dimitrov from the SDS leadership.  He claimed that two-thirds of the SDS deputies agreed with him,  including Zlatka Ruseva, Vesela Rasheeva, and most of the  deputies from the United Christian Democratic Center, the RDP  [Radical Democratic Party], and the DP [Democratic Party].    The SDS parliamentary group does not have the powers to  decide on my resignation, F. Dimitrov explained with a smile.  Under the SDS regulations, Dimitrov said, he can only be  removed from his post if five of the SDS member parties raise  the issue in the National Coordinating Council and 10 of the 15  parties then vote against the incumbent leader. If it so  decides, the SDS parliamentary group can only decide to remove  certain deputies from its ranks, but this does not affect their  powers in the National Coordinating Council.</p>

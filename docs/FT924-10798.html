			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / International Company News: South African bank advances 23.5% DESPITE a 32 per cent increase in provisions for bad debts, First National Bank, South Africa's third-largest bank, increased earnings per share by 15.5 per cent in the year to September. Net profits advanced by 23.5 per cent to R1.95bn (Dollars 661m) from R1.58bn. Other operating income - mostly fee-based business - rose 16.8 per cent to R1.3bn from R1.1bn, while other operating expen-diture rose by 13 per cent to R2.15bn from R1.9bn. Mr Barry Swart, managing director, said a 32 per cent increase in bad debt provisions to R347m from R263m was a function of the business climate worsening throughout the year, contrary to earlier expectations of an upturn in the second half, as well as the country's very severe drought. He said the provisions were 'prudently conservative'. Bad debts were 0.79 per cent of total advances. He said FNB was pleased with the 14.2 per cent increase in total advances to R33.2bn from R29.1bn, given that the rise came against a background of an economy that shrank by about 1.5 per cent in the year to September. A large portion of the increase came in the home loan field, where advances grew by 40 per cent over the year. Mr Swart said FNB hoped to conclude the acquisition of Henry Ansbacher, the UK merchant bank, within a few weeks. He said buying an existing business with premises, people and profits was preferable to starting from scratch. Earnings per share rose by 15.5 per cent to 611 cents from 529.3 cents.</p>

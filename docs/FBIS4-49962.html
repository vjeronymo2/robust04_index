			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The fifth meeting of the sixth Standing  Committee of the autonomous regional committee of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] closed in the  morning of 11 May. [passage omitted]    Addressing the meeting, Basang, deputy secretary of the  autonomous regional party committee and vice chairman of the  autonomous regional committee of the CPPCC, said: Since the  first meeting of the Sixth Standing Committee of the Tibet  Autonomous Regional Committee of the CPPCC, the committee,  guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism  with Chinese characteristics, has been conscientiously  implementing guidelines set by 14th CPC National Congress, the  third plenary session of the 14th Central Committee, and the  fifth (enlarged) meeting of the fourth autonomous regional party  committee; holding high the flags of patriotism and socialism;  persisting in the principles of long-term coexistence, mutual  supervision, and treating each other with all sincerity and  sharing weal or woe; fully promoting socialist democracy;  seriously exercising the functions of political consultations  and democratic supervision amid economic construction; and  making its due contributions toward the region's political  stability, reform and opening up, economic development, and  social progress. As this year will be an important year for  China's on-going reform, opening up, and modernization drive,  "seizing the opportunities, deepening reform, opening wider,  promoting development, and maintaining stability" will be the  overall strategies for the entire nation." Within the realm of  these overall strategies, we in the CPPCC must first identify  our position, select a favorable perspective, and bring out our  superiority before we offer plans and ideas for stabilizing the  situation and promoting reform, opening up, and economic  construction. In line with the principle of macroeconomics,  pioneering, in-depth, and practicality, we should actively  participate in government and political affairs by putting  forward plans and ideas, concentrating on major problems  surfacing in carrying out the central tasks of the autonomous  regional party committee and government, on difficult points in  economic development, and on flash topics of common concern. In  his speech, Comrade Basang put forward concrete demands on ways  to better bring out the role of consultation and supervision  under the CPPCC system and how special investigations,  self-construction, and organizational services can be  intensified.</p>

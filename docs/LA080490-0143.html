			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MCGWIRE SETS SIGHTS ON SNAPPING SLUMP;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: OAKLAND'S NOT-SO-BRASH BASH BROTHER HOMERS TO HELP ATHLETICS DEFEAT  THE ANGELS, 8-6.  </P> <P> Mark McGwire's vision is imperfect. He looks out on the world -- and at  incoming pitches -- through contact lenses of an unsettling brilliant green.  </P> <P> But corrective lenses do not mean he does not have a good eye.  </P> <P> Nor does the fact that when he walked into Anaheim Stadium Friday, McGwire was  batting .216 and in the clutches of a 1-for-19 slump, with eight strikeouts  among those outs.  </P> <P> The outs have kept coming -- strikeouts and groundouts, hard-hit balls that  might have been hits. Everything but actual hits, and that includes walks, of  which McGwire now has 68, third most in the American League.  </P> <P> "Some people look at my strikeouts and don't think I have a very good eye,"  McGwire said. "I look at my walks, and they're in the 60s. I look at my  strikeouts, and they're in the low 70s. You keep that even, that's a pretty  good ratio. I have to have a good eye to walk as much as I do."  </P> <P> McGwire went 0 for 3 Thursday night in Oakland's victory over the Angels -- and  walked twice. He went 1 for 3 Friday in Oakland's 8-6 victory at Anaheim  Stadium.  </P> <P> He walked once Friday. And broke through his slump with a hit in the eighth  inning -- the kind of hit that is expected from one of the Bash Brothers.  McGwire, the less brash, hit a solo homer to right-center, scoring the final  Oakland run in a game they won after trailing, 6-0.  </P> <P> McGwire's homer, his 28th, combined with Dave Henderson's two-run homer to add  a dose of power to a team that was without its main power source. Jose Canseco  left the game in the early innings because he felt ill.  </P> <P> McGwire is hitting in the low .200s in the next-to-last month of the season --  or the next-to-last month of most players' seasons.  </P> <P> "I've got two months left, and probably a pretty good chance of going to the  championship series and World Series," he said. "It's not how you start, it's  how you finish."  </P> <P> He has hit .289, .260 and .231 in his three full major league seasons.  </P> <P> "People emphasize my average too much," he said. "How about my on-base  percentage? How about my walks? My home runs? My RBIs?"  </P> <P> His on-base percentage is not to be overlooked. It is .344, which does not  touch Rickey Henderson's American League-leading .441. But it is nearly 130  percentage points higher than his average, and that is a rare difference.  </P> <P> "It doesn't matter who you are," McGwire said, "some area of your game, people  are gonna say things and write things about you. But hey, I'm a streaky  hitter."  </P> <P> Cold, and then hot. Before his recent slump he had hit in seven straight games,  batting .346.  </P> <P> He takes a big swing, and he undergoes big swings.  </P> <P> The last big swing he took Friday sent a ball over the fence -- the eighth time  he has homered in 21 career games in Anaheim Stadium -- bad eyes and all.  </P></p>

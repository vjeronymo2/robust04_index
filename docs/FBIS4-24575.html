			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Wang Chien (3769 0494): </F> "Most-Favored-Nation Status Issue Surpasses Bilateral  Relations; There Are Still Many Latent Problems in Sino-U.S.  Relations"    [Text] Professor Yuan Ming, director of Beijing  University's International Relations Research Institute, has  pointed out that the United States' decision to renew China's  most-favored-nation [MFN] status and separate the MFN issue from  human rights is good for Sino-U.S. relations. But she stressed  that the settlement of the MFN issue does not mean sustained  smoothness in Chinese-U.S. relations; instead, there are still  many latent problems.    Yuan Ming pointed out: As a matter of fact, the MFN issue  has gone beyond the scope of bilateral relations. When making a  decision on this, it was impossible for the United States to  consider it in isolation from other issues, and, to a great  extent, the United States was also restricted by other countries.    She was of this opinion: Three forces made the Clinton  administration unconditionally extend China's MFN status. The  first was Europe and Japan. At a meeting of the  U.S.-Japanese-European Trilateral Commission at the end of March  this year, Japan and Europe strongly signaled relevant messages.  The second were the multinational corporations, which have  interests in the Chinese market. The third were China's  neighbouring countries, such as Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia,  and so on.    Yuan Ming pointed out that the settlement of the MFN issue  is  unquestionably good for Sino-U.S. relations and enables China  and the United States to concentrate their attention on other  important world affairs, including security in East Asia. But  she stressed that the settlement of this year's MFN issue does  not mean sustained smoothness in Chinese-U.S. relations.    There have been changes in China, and the United States is  also experiencing change, but due to prolonged historical and  cultural differences, she pointed out that there are latent  problems in Sino-U.S. relations.    For example, theoretically, the United States acknowledges  that China is important, but in reality it does not know how to  proceed with this matter; U.S. companies in the Chinese market  are not as competitive as Japanese, South Korean, Taiwan, or  Hong Kong companies.    In addition, following the economic development of East  Asia,  the awakening of "East Asian self-confidence" is regarded as an  anti-Western ideology by the United States.    She pointed out that China and the United States need to  cooperate extensively in international affairs, which are linked  to each other and cannot be viewed in isolation from each other,  adding that China and the United States have many problems to  resolve on security issues in Asia-Pacific in particular.</p>

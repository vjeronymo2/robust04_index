			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Amstrad Mr Alan Sugar refrained from saying 'I told you so' in his comments accompanying Amstrad's interim results. But the trading picture is certainly every bit as dismal as he forecast when trying to take the company private in 1992. Amstrad may have chosen to axe a fair chunk of products, such as low margin computers and videos, which were not worth persevering with. Even so, sales have been shrinking at an alarming rate. Competitive pressures on the high street have remained intense while rival manufacturers have been eating into Amstrad's few remaining areas of strength, such as satellite dishes. Only interest income enabled Amstrad to remain in the black at the pre-tax level. But the first half of the year is traditionally the stronger. A full-year loss now seems a real possibility. Following yesterday's 11 per cent slide, Amstrad's shares appear to be heading back inexorably towards Mr Sugar's offer price of 30p - although they should find some support from the company's Pounds 143m cash pile, which equates to about 24p a share. The visibility of Amstrad's earnings stream was never good at the best of times. Now, even the management cannot see from where it will come. Mr Sugar has wisely refrained from embarking on a panic-driven shopping spree. Shareholders must therefore pin their hopes on Dancall expanding aggressively in mobile telephones. That market is certainly attractive. Amstrad aims to launch a new product later this year. But it is a slender thread by which to hang so many doubts.</p>

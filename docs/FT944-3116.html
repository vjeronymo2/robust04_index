			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / EU packaging directive passed The European parliament yesterday passed the long-delayed directive on packaging and packaging waste, setting targets for the recovery and recycling of packaging waste. It will take effect in the new year. The directive gives member countries 18 months to draw up legislation aimed at recovering between 50 per cent and 65 per cent by weight of packaging waste each year. Between 25 per cent and 45 per cent of packaging waste must be recycled, with a minimum of 15 per cent for each packaging material. Members then have five years to achieve the targets. The targets, lower than originally proposed two years ago, were agreed by European environment ministers last year but the directive was delayed by opposition from Belgium to an amendment which it feared would limit its ability to levy eco-taxes. Following redrafting, the directive was passed by European agriculture ministers on Tuesday. 'This is very good news for the industry,' said the UK's Industry Council on Packaging and the Environment. 'Everyone can plan for the future knowing what the requirements are.' The council called the targets 'realistic and achievable', adding that the directive would prevent members from introducing national packaging legislation.</p>

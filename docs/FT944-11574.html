			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK parliament has best that money can buy Sir, The British parliament's raison d'etre was to give the ruled some means to curb the excesses of the executive. The system of party politics, combined with the whips' office, ensures that the executive now curbs both parliament and the ruled, who are now totally reliant on the media to curb, or at least disclose through the essential difference between news and propaganda, the activities of the executive. The ascendancy of the professional over vocational politicians, in what many of them had come to regard as virtually a one-party state, has resulted in the mother of parliaments having among its members the best that money can buy. John Donovan, 17A La Pleta, Ordino, Andorra</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jad Salim] </F>   [Text] Kabul--A lot has been said and written about the  `Afghan Arabs,' those people who had come from numerous Arab  countries to fight the communists alongside the Afghan  mujahedin. Since then, these people's native countries have been  calling them the `Afghans' and have been afraid of them because  these Arabs are well-trained in combat by U.S. intelligence.  When Afghanistan's jihad [struggle] against communism ended,  numerous `Afghan Arabs' departed Afghanistan's mountains, some  returning to their native countries where they joined armed  radical fundamentalism and carried out some military operations,  motivating local authorities to pursue them as dangerous  terrorists. The others returned to Peshawar, Pakistan, which was  asked to deport them as soon as possible. Some people say that  Islamabad has met the demand and deported the `Afghan Arabs' to  Sudan and Iran. Others say that Pakistan pushed them out the  door only to open a window for them to return and that they come  and go as they wish in Peshawar. What is certain is that a large  number of these `Afghan Arabs' continue to use this city as  their center, moving easily between Peshawar, which is close to  Afghanistan's northern border, and northern Afghanistan.  According to Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, military commander of the  Jami'yat-e Eslami Party which controls power in Kabul, there are  nearly 70-80 `Afghan Arabs' who continue to fight in southern  Kabul side by side with his rival Golboddin Hekmatyar, the  Hezb-e Eslami Party chairman and Afghanistan's prime minister  who is not exercising his powers. Like Hekmatyar, the governor  of Kunduz Province, in northern Afghanistan, denies the presence  of these Arab combatants. To seek the truth, AL- WATAN AL-'ARABI  has toured Afghanistan to look for these Arabs and has found  them. So where are the `Afghan Arabs' now and what do they do?    One looks for them but cannot find them. One hears about  them  but cannot see them. One goes here and there and asks about the  `Afghan Arabs,' and one is told, "Perhaps they are near Mazar-i  Sharif and in Takhar and Tashqurghan. They have training camps  there. But do not bother because you will not find them."    I headed for Mazar-i Sharif and to Takhar and Tashqurghan. I  went around; I searched; and I asked. But there was no trace of  any training camp. However, with great difficulty I found Hasan.  Hasan is a 28-year old Arab, as he says when he is asked. But it  is difficult for Hasan to conceal his Egyptian accent. Hasan  talks to one gently and politely and explains his position on  jihad, saying, "It is jihad for God and Islam against Islam's  enemies." Hasan was asked, "Now that the Afghan jihad against  communism has ended, what are you doing here in Mazar-i Sharif?"  Hasan responded that jihad against communism has not ended  because communism has not disappeared completely from  Afghanistan, considering that "there are active and influential  elements that continue to operate in the government and that  control sensitive positions. If we consider what is going on in  Tajikistan, our neighbor, we would become certain that communist  is still extant and that it is trying to return forcefully to  the region. So how can we end the jihad?"    When one asks Hasan about the training camps, one is told  that they exist. But Hasan will reveal no more, because when he  joined his group, Hasan promised that he would not disclose any  details. All we have been able to learn from Hasan is that all  the vast barren expanses are training grounds where training  camps are set up by night and disappear by dawn "because we do  not need buildings and we do not need tent camps to train in the  use of weapons and to master offensive military strategies. The  environment belongs to us. We may meet under a shady tree or  hide behind a hill."    Very adroitly, Hasan refused to disclose the number of  `Afghan Arabs,' their nationalities, or their ages. We asked  him, "Do you not want to go back home? He answered, "Someday,  perhaps soon. My country needs me and needs my knowledge." He  departs, placing his hand on his heart as a sign of peace and as  a greeting, stroking his black beard with the other hand in the  meanwhile.    After a 24-hour search in Tashqurghan, I met with 'Adnan.  Like everybody else, 'Adnan is masked and he wears the Afghan  garb which consists of a shirt, a pair of pants, and a black  turban. If Hasan's accent betrayed his attempt to conceal his  citizenship, then 'Adnan masters all of the Arab world's  accents. When he speaks, one decides one minute that he is an  Egyptian, another minute a Palestinian, or perhaps an Algerian,  an Iraqi, or a Libyan. His strange mixture of accents confuses  one. When one asks him, "What is your citizenship, 'Adnan?" He  answers, "What business do you have with my citizenship? I am an  Arab and I struggle for what is right. My conviction is my faith  and my faith unites me with my brothers, whatever their  citizenship."    One then asks, "Why do you train when jihad has ended?"  'Adnan answers, with all his features turning into a question  mark, "Ended? If, and I say if, jihad has ended here, then it  has not ended in our Arab countries. Right will triumph soon.  God's word will be carried out soon, and it is for this word  that we work. Do not try to get any clarifications or  information from me. I have taken the oath to keep things secret  and to remain silent. Do not look for others, either, because we  are all faithful."  <H5>  Algerian 'Abbas: I Am Libyan </H5>   I left the province and headed for the city of Kunduz,  carrying deep inside me a despair that was dragging my steps  backward. But the thread of hope holding my curiosity and my  desire for knowledge was stronger. Immediately upon arriving in  the city, which is located 332 km north of Kabul, the capital, I  headed for the office of Governor Qari Rahmatollah. I introduced  myself and delivered to him a letter of introduction from a  prominent political figure in the country. He welcomed me warmly  and expressed his willingness to meet my wishes.    I told him I wanted to see 'Abbas, a name that had been  mentioned in my presence by an official in Kabul. He is an  Algerian who heads an Islamic organization in Kunduz which  coordinates humanitarian aid to Tajik refugees.    At my request, the governor of Kunduz, who was my host,  summoned 'Abbas. To honor a guest in Afghanistan, custom  requires that a number of notables be invited to have dinner  with him. So, the reception hall was swarming with men. As soon  as dinner ended at about 2000, 'Abbas came in. He is a tall,  brown-skinned, and no more than 35 years old. He wears a pair of  pants, a shirt, a vest, and a black turban. His beard is also  black but not thick, and he strokes it between one word and the  other, as if seeking inspiration from it. Those present  conversed, and I listened and watched without interrupting,  convinced that my turn to speak would inevitably come. But I  miscalculated.    'Abbas was undoubtedly aware of my profession and of the  purpose behind my request to meet him. He spoke in general terms  and avoided looking at me directly. From time to time, he gave  me a side glance. Whenever I tried to catch his eye, he turned  his face away, as if afraid that I would ask him a question. But  I did not ask any until the others finished talking about  humanitarian aid and about generalities, and also until they  finished exchanging their courtesies. When I asked 'Abbas about  his citizenship, knowing full well that he is an Algerian--a  fact confirmed to me by everybody who sat in that hall and who  knew 'Abbas very well--he flashed me a quick look and fired his  words as if he wished they were bullets that could hit me,  saying, "I am Libyan." He stood up straight like an arrow, asked  to be excused because he was late for some important business,  and departed with the speed of lightning, leaving behind tension  in the air.    I remained seated on the floor. The rapid succession of  developments paralyzed every move I had hoped to make, and I  remained paralyzed until I was pulled out of my state and  awakened by a guest who said, "What is the matter with you? You  are as silent as a rock. You wanted to see 'Abbas. He has come  and you have not asked him a single question." To justify  'Abbas's assumption of a different identity, this guest started  to criticize me and to accuse me of seeking out Arabs for one  purpose only, namely to offend them. "Why do you want to harm  them? Why do you harbor ill will for them? Why do you  investigate their affairs. They are jihad people. 'Abbas, for  example, has been here for six years and he speaks Dari like any  Afghan. All he does is work to help the Tajik refugees."    "Of course," I said to the man, "but the Tajik refugees have  not been here for a year yet. Besides, where does 'Abbas get the  money to help the refugees?"    "How surprising," said more than one guest to me. "Why did  you not ask him this question? We are not interested in the  source of the money. What is important is the aid given to the  refugees.    "But are you not worried for your condition from movements  that perhaps conceal some unhumanitarian purposes behind them?"    "Do you not worry about us? We need aid. The Tajik refugees  are a burden to us and our governorate is poor."    The following day, I asked to see 'Abbas again. The city  governor sent an emissary to him, but this emissary returned to  tell us that 'Abbas was very busy and that he did not have a  single minute to spare. The reason was that during the night, an  attempt had been made on the life of 'Abdol Ghafur, leader of  the Tajik refugees in Kunduz. Armed men entered a home where a  confidential meeting was in progress and opened fire from their  automatic weapons. 'Abdol Ghafur escaped the attempt but his  personal guard was killed.    I turned to Governor Qari Rahmatollah and said to him: tell  me about the Tajik refugees and the problems you encounter.    Kunduz governor proceeded to tell me that the Tajik refugees  (Muslims) have occupied the schools in he center of the city,  thus compelling teachers and students to conduct their studies  in school yards or under trees and reducing the number of  students. The refugees have also set up large camps at the  military airfield, in Imam al-Bukhara, and in Bagh Sharkat  (sites around the city of Kunduz).  <H5>  Training Camps for Tajiks </H5>   When refugees started arriving in Kunduz, the people helped  them. But then refugee numbers multiplied so rapidly, the people  could help no more. So, a Higher Refugees Committee was formed  of Tajik members and and it began to collect donations and  distribute them to the refugees. This committee was followed by  an Arab organization named the Islamic Aid Coordination  Committee, which tends and provides aid to the refugees. The  governor went on to add that this committee's activities are  limited and do not exceed humanitarian objectives. Last summer,  a number of refugee children and old men died because of high  temperatures and lack of medicines. They suffer greatly because  their life here is difficult. They also need foodstuffs. The  Islamic Coordination Committee provides just one loaf of bread,  i.e., 120 grams of bread, per person daily. This is not enough  to feed a human being.    Kunduz is a peaceful city, according to its governor, and no  problems will develop in it because the local consultative  council includes members from the various parties existing in  the region. The governor also said that he works ceaselessly to  safeguard the city's security and that he holds a weekly meeting  to examine and deal with the conditions. Despite these security  facilities, nobody other than the Arabs has come to help the  refugees. The United Nations is absent from Kunduz, and "we have  appealed to the United Nations and to the Islamic countries to  aid the refugees, and also our governorate which suffers from a  different problem, namely the return of Afghan refugees. To  date, Iran and Pakistan have evicted 700,000 Afghan refugees in  the direction of Kunduz. The Afghan Government is unable to help  and aid these refugees. This is why we have appealed to  non-governmental organizations and why we have assured them that  security here is firm and that they can operate without any  fear. It seems that the first organization to respond will be  Doctors Without Borders, a French organization."    I asked the governor about reports that the Arabs, who are  active in Kunduz, have rejected the entry of any  non-governmental international organization to the city. In  response, he was content to say that an understanding has been  reached on this issue, that humanitarian organizations must be  invited, and that no obstacles must be placed in their way. I  asked the governor if officials are getting more befuddled  because Tajik refugees are replacing their tents with solid  houses, thus confirming their intention to stay in Afghanistan  for a long time? The governor answered that nobody is forcing  them to stay or to return to Tajikistan, especially since they  assert that the communists will kill them if they return,  considering that these communists have already burned down and  destroyed their homes. Moreover, Afghan hospitality and the  Islamic faith do not permit officials to deport Tajik refugees.  I left the governor and headed for Kunduz airfield. On the way,  I saw a sign pointing to the office of the Islamic Relief  Organization, i.e., 'Abbas's office. I passed close to it and  followed a rugged road to get to the military airfield camp.    The camp encompasses nearly 1,000 buildings, some  constructed  of clay and some of lumber. Every building is tantamount to a  number of rooms. Seven to 10 persons live in each room, of which  one corner is set aside for cooking. I moved from room to room  and from building to building, surrounded by a troop of children  who looked at me as if I had just descended from Mars. I entered  a wooden building that has been turned into a hospital. There, I  met with Dr. Taleb Shah Faydzadeh, the camp physician who fled  Tajikistan in December 1992 to escape death. Faydzadeh asserted  that the airport camp alone includes 22,000 refugees and that  there are nearly 40,000 Tajik refugees in Kunduz and its  suburbs. I asked him about the living conditions and about aid.  He answered with a choking voice that living conditions are very  difficult, that youth and men can rarely find work in the city,  and that aid comes from some Afghans, and especially from Arabs.  What Arabs? "I do not know what Arabs. All I know is that there  is a coordination committee that collects donations. Every  morning, the Arabs distribute a loaf of bread to every person.  Drugs are dwindling, and patients are increasing in numbers.  Some patients are people who have lost arms or legs to mines  planted around the airfield. There are five Tajik physicians  here, and at times we enlist the help of the Kunduz hospital  physicians."    [Salim] Where do you get money to buy food?    [Faydzadeh] Some young men are employed in construction or  sanitation work in the city, even though they may have high  college degrees. However, we prefer such work to returning to  Tajikistan, where our lives will be endangered by the communists  who have destroyed our homes and burnt our lands and property.    I had decided to leave the airfield camp. But an eight-year  old child insisted, while holding my hand, on taking me to her  family room. I went to that room and found seven children and  two women there. I asked one of them: where is your husband?    "He went to the training camp."    "What camp and what sort of training?"    "I do not know. But he tells me that if he does not go, the  Arabs will not aid us."    I did not know what to do when the other woman assured me  that her son had also gone to the training camp, but that she  did not know where this camp was located or who managed it. All  she knew is that the camp's youth and men went to train in jihad  against communism and communists.    At nearly 1,500 meters from the airfield, another camp has  been set up for Tajik refugees. It is Imam al-Bukhari Camp and  it includes 8,000 refugees. If two mosques have been built at  the airfield camp for the 22,000 refugees, then five mosques are  being built at the same time in the new al-Bukhari Camp.    In Imam al-Bukhari, old men and a few young men are busy  building a hospital and the five mosques. Anybody you ask at  this camp will tell you that the youth have gone to train for  jihad. But nobody will tell you the location of the training  camp, the duration of training, or the people in charge of this  "profession." When one asks about aid, the answer given is,  "They are the Arabs. They give us food and materials to build  our tents and the mosques."  <H5>  We Want Weapons, not Aid </H5>   From Imam al-Bukhari, I went to Bagh Sharkat Camp, where a  model village is being built. The area is a vast barren expanse  where every refugee selects his own spot and builds his own  house on his own and in the style he wishes.    In Bagh Sharkat, I met with a 50-year-old man who had  finished building his home's outer walls and who was busy with  internal partition. As soon as he learned that I was a  journalist, he started yelling as loudly as he could, "We want  weapons. We do not want food aid. We need weapons to fight  against communism in our country, Tajikistan. I am building this  home for my wife and children. But I will not live in it because  I will go to the jihad. I am training daily, and I can still  carry arms. I have sold some property to buy weapons and I will  sell the car I own for the same purpose. Moreover, the Arabs  give us some aid and we also have some weapons hidden here. But  we need more."    I asked this zealot, "Where do you train and what kind of  weapons do you have?" His answer was a smile, after which he  went on to talk about jihad against communism. Again, I asked  about the type of aid advanced by the Arabs. He responded, "The  Arabs help us and help everybody. Every morning, they come here  and leave construction materials, lumber, and stones. We take  whatever we need to build our homes. They also give us bread.  But they do not give us money."    "Which Arabs?"    "The Arabs. I do not know which Arabs."    I became certain I could get no more information. So I left,  having decided to head for the border area of Sherkhan Bandar  near the Amu Darya River, which is 50 km from Kunduz and which  is considered the border separating Tajikistan from Afghanistan.    There, the UN Higher Refugees Commission tends a refugee  camp  that includes 2,000 refugees who lack drugs, but not food.    Natasha, a nurse at this camp, invited us to have tea at her  tent where she lives with her husband, who was absent that day,  and with her seven children. She was in her seventh month of  pregnancy. As soon as we sat down, Asad came into the tent. Asad  was a dark-skinned man with piercing eyes. When he spoke, his  thundering voice almost brought down the tent on our heads.  Karim came in Asad's company. Karim was a 50-year-old man with  features that were not as harsh as those of Asad. He spoke with  fear in his voice. He turned left and right while speaking, as  if looking for a spy or an observer hiding behind this or that  couch.    Of course, I addressed all my questions to Asad, who  proceeded to explain his current life to me:    "I came to Afghanistan in January 1993. I lived at the  border  camp of Imam Sahib initially. But I live at the Kunduz airfield  camp now and I come here to Kunduz nearly every day to visit my  daughter. In Kunduz, we get food aid from the Afghan Government  and from the Arabs, as well as some aid from the Iranians."    "What kind?"    "Any kind of aid one can think of, and I will say no more."    Asad went on to assert that the Afghans have not asked the  refugees to return to their homes, and that these refugees will  not return as long as their Tajikistan is run by criminal  communists. Rather, the refugees will carry on with their  struggle, jihad, and political action in exile. Asad talked at  length about the communists, whom he has known for 17 years. He  has asserted that the refugees are accused of being radical  Islamists and that the communist government uses this excuse to  pursue and kill them.    I asked Asad, "How do you struggle?" He answered, "We meet  from time to time at a certain place in Kunduz. We study the  situation and determine the steps that we have to take.  Yesterday, for example, I was present when the attack against  leader of the Tajik refugees in Kunduz was made. The communists  wanted to assassinate him, but failed. 'Abdol Ghafur survived  but, regrettably, his guard was killed. We also train at various  and changing sites on how to launch attacks. Several months ago,  we launched an offensive from the border Imam Sahib point. I did  not take part in it but 500 other refugees and some Arabs did."    I interposed at this point and asked him, "What Arabs? What  are their nationalities?" After a moment's hesitation, he said,  "Two Egyptians took part in the offensive. Regrettably, it  failed and 300 attackers, including the two Egyptians, were  arrested. The others managed to return."    Karim then interposed to tell me that he had gone into  Tajikistan twice as a delegation member and that conditions have  not changed there, as confirmed by messages received from  Tajikistan. He said that, consequently, he does not believe that  any refugee will decide to return home soon and that most  refugees have resolved to stay and train in jihad.    I left the camp and took a tea break at the residence of  employees of the UN Higher Refugees Commission before taking the  road back to Kabul. At this residence, one employee said to me,  "Look for a person called Ishaq in the capital. He knows a lot  about the `Afghan Arabs.'"  <H5>  They Went to Sudan </H5>   As soon as I got back to Kabul, I did, in fact, start  looking  for Ishaq, and I found him in one of the ministries.    Ishaq said, "The Arab youth who came to Pakistan from the  Middle East to support the mujahedin are divided into several  groups. Some came for humanitarian work; others came to continue  their studies, and most of those were Palestinian communists;  and some came first and foremost for the purpose of jihad, and  they took part in battles in south and east Afghanistan.  However, they all fought alongside the mujahedin and they  asserted that they were members of the International Islamic  Conference. Because they had various political tendencies and  opinions, they supported this or that party. Generally, they  supported either Golboddin and his Hezb-e-Eslami Party or Sayyaf  and his Ettehad-e Eslami Party. This condition persisted until  the Kabul [communist] government collapsed. At that time, some  `Afghan Arabs' decided that the jihad had ended and that they  had to support the government. Others believed in Hekmatyar's  principles, arguments, and ideas which stressed that Kabul's  government was not Islamic and that, therefore, the jihad had to  continue. These `Afghan Arabs' are currently fighting in Kabul  with the Hezb-e-Eslami Party's forces. But they do not exceed  100 in number, and some of them have been killed in battles."    Ishaq added, "Pakistan has deported a number of `Afghan  Arabs' to Sudan, which is trying to get control over the  remaining groups here in one way or another. One should keep in  mind that several countries, led by Iran, Sudan, and Pakistan,  are involved in financing and adopting Islamist elements.    "As for the U.S. intelligence agencies, which are eager to  learn what is going on, they request reports on the Islamists'  activities in Pakistan. But I doubt that Islamabad provides a  true picture of the real situation."    I thanked Ishaq for this information. But another question  kept occurring in my mind: "Why is the United Nations absent  from Tajik camps in the north?"    I posed this question to a UN official, and he offered a  clear answer, pointing out that there was no need to disclose  his name. He said, "The United Nations is absent, especially  from Kunduz, because it does not wish to become embroiled with  the Islamists. These people are very active in the camps and  they urge the Tajiks to struggle with all means. We are not  prepared to enter into territory planted with human mines with  the consent of Afghan officials, even though we are completely  confident that our position suits the radicals and gives them a  free hand."</p>

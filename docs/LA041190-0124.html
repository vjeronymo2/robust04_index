			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LITTLE ADO IN O.C. OVER NEA FUROR;  </P> <P> REGULATION: THE RESPONSE TO THE NATIONAL DEBATE HAS BEEN MINIMAL, ESPECIALLY IN  CONTRAST WITH THE REACTION IN LOS ANGELES, WHERE 27 ARTISTS WERE ARRESTED LAST  MONTH.  </P> <P> Yaakov Dvir-Djerassi is galled by efforts of Orange County Rep. Dana  Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) and others to restrict federal funding of the arts and  likens a government that controls the content of artwork it supports to  pre-glasnost Communism.  </P> <P> "Art in a Communist government is used as a tool to express government  propaganda," said Dvir-Djerassi, general manager of the Garden Grove Symphony.  "It's not the business of the government to tell the arts how to conduct  business."  </P> <P> Rohrabacher, a leading congressional foe of the National Endowment for the  Arts, wants to abolish the federal arts agency entirely. Yet Dvir-Djerassi has  taken no action on behalf of the symphony over attacks on NEA funding of art  exhibits considered by conservatives to be obscene and sacrilegious.  </P> <P> Garden Grove is part of the district of Rep. Robert K. Dornan, not Rohrabacher,  but Dvir-Djerassi said he is worried about going against the grain of the  county's conservative political climate and wishes to "depoliticize" the  orchestra. Thus, the symphony has remained officially silent and ignored pleas  from the American Symphony Orchestra League, a national service organization  with more than 850 members, to petition Congress.  </P> <P> The symphony is not alone. The county arts community's response to the national  debate has been minimal, certainly in any organized or public fashion and  especially in contrast with the response in Los Angeles, where 27 artists were  arrested last month during a demonstration.  </P> <P> Even Robert Garfias, a UC Irvine anthropology professor and one of 26 members  of the National Council on the Arts -- which advises the NEA on grant  recipients and policies -- has not tried to rally local NEA support. Other than  his board membership with the Orange County Philharmonic Society, Garfias said,  he is "not really involved" with the local arts community any more. Garfias was  once on the board of the defunct Orange County Arts Alliance, a countywide arts  agency.  </P> <P> Some local arts administrators have taken such actions as writing legislators  to support the NEA, and several said they urged their trustees or general  membership to express their views. But no public protests or organized events  have taken place here since the controversy erupted last year, and none are  planned in the near future, according to several artists and administrators  interviewed -- even though hundreds of thousands of NEA grant dollars have been  awarded here, nearly $450,000 in 1989 alone.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, county artists and arts administrators interviewed recently  expressed unanimous support for reauthorization of the NEA without restrictions  on the content of artworks. Congress is holding hearings for reauthorization of  the NEA, whose current budget is $171 million.  </P> <P> "I haven't done anything; I'm completely embarrassed to tell you that," said  one local artist, who requested anonymity.  </P> <P> The NEA controversy erupted over two photography exhibits that received NEA  support. One, by the late Robert Mapplethorpe, contained sadomasochistic and  homoerotic images. The other, by Andres Serrano, depicted a crucifix in a jar  of urine.  </P> <P> Outraged by the exhibits, Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), the agency's chief Senate  foe, pushed through legislation that bars for one year NEA funding of what he  called obscene artworks that do not meet certain standards of artistic  excellence.  </P> <P> Dornan supports the Helms restrictions, an aide said, and throughout the  protracted debate, Rohrabacher has attacked the NEA repeatedly for funding  exhibits he considers obscene. Others urge a ban on federal funding of projects  that they consider obscene or blasphemous.  </P> <P> In response to these attacks, Los Angeles artists and arts administrators  formed the Coalition for Freedom of Expression. Working to oppose censorship  and NEA funding restrictions, the ad hoc group staged several public protests.  In one, 250 people marched into downtown Los Angeles; 27 were arrested. In  another action, computers were set up in several Los Angeles restaurants for a  letter-writing campaign that resulted in 3,000 letters to Congress, coalition  co-chairwoman Joy Silverman said.  </P> <P> Similar coalitions have been active in Washington, San Francisco and New York,  Silverman said.  </P> <P> Some county residents have been working with the Los Angeles coalition,  Silverman said. Orange County artists or others may have also taken part in  protests in Los Angeles, where the arts community is older, larger, more  cohesive and better organized than Orange County's.  </P> <P> Also, some arts officials have spoken out. Among those who have written various  legislators personally or on behalf of their organizations are David Emmes,  producing artistic director of South Coast Repertory, an NEA grant recipient  annually since the early 1970s.  </P> <P> NEA funding, which totaled $95,000 to SCR last year, "has been a tremendous  catalyst in stimulating local support," said Emmes, adding that the  organization's trustees were also urged to write legislators.  </P> <P> Officials at the Newport Harbor Art Museum, whose NEA grants totaled $111,000  in 1989, have sent several letters to lawmakers while also suggesting that  trustees do so.  </P> <P> The Laguna Art Museum, which won $27,500 in NEA grants last year, has a policy  for "freedom of artistic expression," director Charles Desmarais said. The  museum's 1989 newsletter suggested that the museum's 3,000 members contact  their congressmen.  </P> <P> Still, many in the arts community have done nothing. Explanations ranged from  busy schedules to a focus on local affairs.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach is within Rohrabacher's district, but the Huntington Beach  Allied Arts Board has taken no official action, said board chairman Steve  Schwartz, who added that the uproar "hasn't affected anything we're concerned  with now in Huntington Beach."  </P> <P> The board, which advises the City Council on arts issues, is concentrating on  such matters as creating a new arts center, scheduled to open next spring, and  "other more pressing things on which we feel we can make an impact," Schwartz  said.  </P> <P> Among leaders of larger local arts organizations who said their groups have  taken no official action on the issue are Louis G. Spisto, director of the  Pacific Symphony, and Bonnie McClain, executive director of the Pacific Chorale  -- both 1989 NEA grant recipients.  </P> <P> "I simply have not brought it up at a board level," McClain said.  </P> <P> The Orange County Philharmonic Society has applied for a 1990 NEA grant but has  not officially supported the agency, Executive Director Erich Vollmer said.  Though Vollmer recently met in Washington with NEA chairman John E. Frohnmayer,  the focus was not on the NEA's troubles but on efforts to form a new countywide  arts agency. (Frohnmayer "was very supportive and encouraging and hopes we get  something going," Vollmer said.)  </P> <P> Several artists and arts officials said they believe that such an agency, if  formed, would organize, focus and carry out advocacy efforts. Orange County is  one of just five counties statewide without a "state-local partner," a  countywide agency that is its official arts representative to the state.  </P> <P> Maxine Gaiber, spokeswoman for the Newport Harbor Art Museum, said museum  officials recently decided that their most effective efforts toward supporting  the NEA "would be to focus on development" of a county arts council.  </P></p>

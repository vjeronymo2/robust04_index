			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Heath attacks handling of EU A sterling crisis would be the inevitable result of a referendum on whether Britain should agree to a single European currency, Sir Edward Heath, the former Conservative prime minister, warned last night. In a wide-ranging attack in the Commons on the government's handling of relations with the European Union, he also ridiculed suggestions that withdrawal was a realistic alternative for the UK. Sir Edward, who took Britain into the EC in 1973, criticised Mr John Major, the prime minister, for not firmly ruling out a referendum on the single-currency issue and for allowing Downing Street to be associated with speculation about possible withdrawal. Emphasising that a referendum campaign would extend over four or six weeks, Sir Edward urged those who favoured such a course to remember what happened to sterling in a couple of hours on 'black Wednesday' when it was forced to withdraw from the exchange rate mechanism. He said: 'It's so fantastic it's unbelievable that anyone could even consider the idea as being possible.' He said observers in the US and the Far East thought that people who suggested withdrawal 'are out of their minds, and I agree with them'. Sir Edward called on the government to return to the prime minister's earlier statement that Britain should be 'at the heart of Europe'. This meant being prepared to take part in the 'heartbeats' and to do so wholeheartedly. Mr David Heathcoat-Amory, foreign office minister, said that Britain wanted a 'people's Europe' which was outward-looking and able to face common challenges with confidence. It should not be a Europe for politicians and bureaucrats, but one which responded to people's day-to-day concerns about jobs, security, crime and the need for budgetary discipline and action against waste and fraud. The tone of the debate, arranged as a precursor to next month's elections for the European parliament, was low-key because of the death of Mr John Smith, the Labour leader.</p>

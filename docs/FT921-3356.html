			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / How To Spend It: Welcome to Beanland, home of the hunter LL Bean, the mythic purveyor of rugged outdoor wear to sophisticated modern American urbanites, has started to woo the British market. From their own front rooms the British can now leaf through a catalogue, pick up a telephone, and order the appurtenances of a simpler, hardier, more old-fashioned way of life. For those who wonder what all the fuss is about Karen Fricker makes a pilgrimage to the LL Bean headquarters in Freeport, Maine, the shrine where Americans go to rediscover the America of long ago. IT IS a good thing that the foyer of the LL Bean Store in Freeport, Maine is filled with benches. Entering the only retail outlet of America's most venerable purveyor of outdoor goods and clothing can be overwhelming. Confronted with the American dream realised the hardiest of shoppers needs a sit-down. Last year 3.5m shoppers visited the Freeport store. For Americans, going to Bean is a primal urge, somewhere between family responsibility  - the required visit to eccentric old Uncle LL, as Reader's Digest has dubbed him, who sends us packages - and pilgrimage, to the shrine of an America we wish still existed. In his indoor trout pond (on the main floor, between men's flannel-lined hunting trousers and Gore-Tex anoraks) Americans can wash away the ignominy of mass-marketing, and rediscover the values LL represents - authenticity, reliability, eco-sensitivity, outdoorsiness, hardiness, honesty. The United States of Bean meticulously cultivates its image, posting narratives about company history and 'Our People' (Bean employees), and letters from satisfied customers (one young man who lives at the South Pole jogs happily around Antarctica in Bean extra-strength thermal underwear). Some features of Bean's old-fashioned America jar the 90s consciousness. Though Bean aggressively markets its greenness - sponsoring outdoor discovery programmes and talks about conservation - it also sells a huge selection of shotguns and plays 'how-to-kill-deer' videos in the hunting department. The company and most of its shoppers see no contradiction. Bean was founded to sell hunting gear to hunters, and that purpose remains, although these days real hunters are probably outnumbered by urban bargainovores who covet the country look, like their British counterparts in Barbours and tweeds. Bean, in keeping with its homey image, used only staff as models until the company was attacked because its catalogue contained only white faces. Public relations director Catharine Hartnett, said this was a reflection of the homogeneity of the applicant pool: 'There's not much cultural diversity in Southern Maine.' In the last couple of years the company has started using professional models, of all races, in its catalogue. Best to ignore these little quirks. Sometimes it has not done to look behind the scenes at Disneyland, either. Bean is better than Disneyland: you get the fantasy, and you can shop too. Frontierland with bargains. Adventureland, and you take the coonskin cap and flannel shirt home. And it never closes. Bean is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Excessive? Perhaps. That's Maine for you. That's America. And bottom line, Bean delivers. Between the fun and not-so-practical bits, the store is full of useful, well-made goods. Does the couple from suburban Boston really need an ice fishing shelter (Dollars 76 - Pounds 43.10)? No, but after testing out the floor sample, they can pick up something they might actually use: flannel sheets (Dollars 28) perhaps, or wool blankets (Dollars 180). Will the Florida family really use sleeping bags guaranteed to - 40`F? No, but they probably will use Bean's own brand mountain bikes (Dollars 240) or a Gore-Tex insulated lunchbox (Dollars 14.95) A latter-day Alice's Restaurant, you can get anything you want at Bean: your can get food pancake mix, smoked salmon, Rain Forest Crunch nut brittle, freeze-dried gourmet meals for camping and Walker's shortbread. You can get socks, you can get skis, you can get postcards (and post them in the store), and you can, of course, get Bean's well-made, durable, natural-fibre clothing: chinos, denims, sweaters, turtlenecks. In recent years Bean has introduced a line of what it thinks is fashionable, upscale clothing, but the results have never risen above the frumpy. The Beanland boom began in the late 70s when the company expanded its annual turnover from Dollars 50m to Dollars 250m, and out-of-town visitors started trickling into Freeport to see what the excitement was about. Canny retailers, wanting a piece of the action, bought property up and down Freeport's main street and opened factory outlet stores, offering seconds and off-season merchandise at cut-rate prices. There are now more than 100 retail stores in the Freeport area, from Dansk housewares, to Bass and Timberland shoes, to quality clothing merchants - Brooks Brothers, Evan Picone, Ralph Lauren Polo - to America's most popular casual clothing chains - J. Crew, The Gap, Banana Republic. Freeport has become the leading example of the new American phenomenon of the town defined by shopping: the factory outlet centre. LL Bean's Freeport store may be important to the American identity, but it plays a relatively small role in the Bean company's total business. Mail-order is Bean's backbone - last year it made up 88 per cent of total sales - and has been since 1912, when founder Leon Leonwood 'LL' Bean sent out the first circular advertising his Maine Hunting Boots - leather uppers sewn on to rubber bottoms, still the company's best known product. Company president Leon Gorman has authorised several international ventures, in spite of his grandfather LL's famous dictum against foreign expansion: 'I'm eating three meals a day now, I can't eat four.' Bean has marketed aggressively to the Japanese and Canadian markets since 1989, and last autumn started advertising its catalogues in the British media. Most recently Japanese companies Seiyu and Matsushita Electrical Industrial Company formed 'LL Bean Japan', a joint venture company that will open five retail stores in Japan exclusively for the sale of LL Bean merchandise. To order the postal catalogue or goods phone 1-207-865-3111, fax 1-207-878-2104. or write to LL Bean Freeport, ME 04033, US.

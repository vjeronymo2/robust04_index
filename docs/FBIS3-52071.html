The Argentine Foreign Ministry released a communique  "lamenting and strongly criticizing this attitude which does not  reflect at all the Argentine people and government's deep  feelings of friendship and cooperation."    During the rally Edesur employees hung signs bearing all  kinds of insults against "the Chileans" in front of the company  building. They also burned flags, an effigy of Edesur Chairman  Torralba Ugarte, and a coffin that contained a Chilean flag and  a list of the company's Chilean executives.    The demonstrators were protesting the dismissal of three  company workers on charges of sabotage. They also asked for  better security measures and job stability, and that there  should be no more intimidation to get workers to sign up for  voluntary retirement.</p>

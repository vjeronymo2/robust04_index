			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The election court today nullified the election  of Mr. Geoffrey Muraya Macharia as the Forum for the Restoration  of Democracy [FORD]-Asili MP for Mathare constituency in  Nairobi. Justice Emmanuel O'Kubaso, John Mwera, and Gideon Mbito  in their ruling said the electoral commission erred in not  providing clearly marked ballot papers. As a result, the judges  contended, over 43,000 ballot papers were unmarked, adding that  a large number of votes were not stamped. The court ruled that  after a recount, Muraya Macharia garnered 6,001 stamped votes  and 16,344 unstamped votes. The petitioner, Mr. Frederick  Masinde of FORD-Kenya, scored 8,306 stamped votes and 10,620  unstamped votes.    Consequently, the judges explained that Mr. Masinde scored  over 2,000 votes more than Mr. Muraya going by the number of the  marked votes. The judges, however, noted that no election  offense had been committed and ordered Mr. Muraya and the  electoral commission to meet the cost of the suit.    In the 1992 general elections, Mr. Muraya garnered 23,864  votes, while Mr. Masinde got 19,579. [passage omitted]</p>

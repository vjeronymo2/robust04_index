			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (4): Stable pound confounds cynics - Sterling has benefited from being on the sidelines After the excitement of 1992, when sterling left the exchange rate mechanism, the pound has been remarkably stable. Apart from a brief dip in February and March of 1993, the pound has tended to trade in a range around the DM2.50 level and in an even narrower band around Dollars 1.50. In part, this is because the worst fears aroused at the time of the ERM departure have not been realised. For once, devaluation has not led to a resurgence of inflation in the UK. Indeed, underlying inflation (excluding mortgage payments) has dropped to its lowest level since the 1960s. Furthermore, throughout 1993, the UK's status, along with the US, as one of the few growing economies in the developed world made it a home for portfolio capital. Sterling has also benefited from being on the foreign exchange sidelines over the past 18 months. Traders' focus has been on the breakdown of the narrow band ERM and on the dollar/yen cross-rate. Over the medium term, there are probably two key factors for sterling. The first is whether Britain has conquered its old problems - high inflation and balance of payments crises - or whether the demons will return as soon as the recovery hits its stride. The second is whether the Conservative party is merely suffering its normal mid-term blues or is finally going to lose office. The government has worked hard to try to create credibility for its economic policies after the ignominious departure from the ERM. A new monetary framework has been created, with the Bank of England at its forefront. Underlying inflation is now targeted at 1-4 per cent, with the aim of getting the rate into the lower half of the range by the end of the parliament. The Bank writes quarterly inflation reports, is allowed to choose the timing of base rate changes and has its views aired in the minutes of the monthly monetary meetings. All this is designed to reassure financial markets that 'steady Eddie' George, the Bank governor, is looking after their interests, rather than inflation-prone politicians. The new arrangements have not gone without a hitch. February's decision to cut base rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 5.25 per cent was not received well by the markets, and may have limited the scope for further cuts. Gilt markets have consistently signalled inflationary expectations of 4 per cent or so, indicating some scepticism about the government's ability to meet its target. Signs of a pick-up in the annual growth rate of average earnings will have confirmed bearish fears. Nevertheless, producer price figures and survey details, continue to show that inflationary pressures are subdued. On the balance of payments problem, Mark Geddes, treasury economist at Midland Global Markets, says that while 'recovery in Europe should increasingly help UK exporters, the size of the current account deficit following several years of below trend growth and a 10 per cent devaluation of the pound, remains a worry. The inaccurate nature of current trade statistics potentially disguises the true problem, and a prerequisite for sterling's ability to maintain a value above DM2.50 over the longer term will be a stabilisation in the trade deficit.' Trade within the European Union is now recorded under the Intrastat system, based on the value added tax returns, and this has led some to believe that the statistics are under-recording imports. Furthermore, official figures showing that exporters have been raising prices, rather than chasing market share, are contradicted by Confederation of British Industry evidence. Other fundamental factors - economic growth and interest rates - may be moving in opposite directions. Keith Skeoch, director of research at James Capel, feels that the medium-term outlook for sterling is quite good. On interest rates he expects 'German rates will get down to around 3 per cent on the back of sluggish growth and low inflation, while there is increasing evidence that we are close to the bottom of the base rate cycle in the UK. The pound should start to benefit from a positive interest rate differential.' He also believes that rate differentials will help the dollar strengthen against the D-Mark, and adds that 'sterling normally does reasonably well in an environment where the dollar is running'. He believes the pound could climb to DM2.70. However, because European countries are expected to come out of recession this year, Mr Geddes thinks that Britain's 'growth advantage' will start to disappear. The political outlook might not seem to matter, given that the government does not have to call an election until 1997. But, according to Skeoch, 'the main uncertainty in the medium term is that Major stays and is perceived by the markets as a lame duck PM.' So pronounced is sterling's record of depreciation, that cynics will need overwhelming evidence to believe the bull case for the pound. That evidence, or the depressingly familiar bearish story, can only come when the UK is further advanced in its recovery, and cyclical factors have had their maximum chance to inflict damage on the inflation and balance of payments numbers.</p>

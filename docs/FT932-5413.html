			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: BT's big gamble BT's chairman Mr Iain Vallance - the John Major of the telecoms industry - has finally crystallised his Big Idea. Global services to multinational companies are to be the way forward, while partnership with MCI will enable BT to participate in the US market without diverting attention from the European home base. By any measure the stake in MCI is expensive. BT is paying a 20 per cent premium to what was already an all-time high in MCI's shares. It is hard to justify paying Dollars 4.3bn for a 20 per cent stake in a company with net assets of Dollars 3.2bn. A multiple of 25 times likely 1993 earnings looks pricey when prior to the deal MCI was only expected to grow at 15 per cent over the next two years. Small wonder, then, that MCI is delighted with the deal. It is also a worry that BT's strategic grip has been questionable in the past and all of its previous international gambits have come to naught. Significant revenues from the joint venture are some years off, and while MCI may invest the money to good effect in a rapidly evolving telecoms market, results are by no means certain. Meanwhile AT&amp;T can be expected to make BT's life as miserable as possible. Still, BT can afford such largesse. It is some measure of the strength of BT's domestic business that these deals would have to go very badly wrong indeed to have a material impact on the juggernaut's progress. There is just a chance that if it works the alliance will get BT out of its box in the UK. The government, which is trying to sell BT3 at a discount to UK institutions, might wish that it was AT&amp;T that was trying to buy a substantial stake in BT at a 20 per cent premium.</p>

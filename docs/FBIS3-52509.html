Having suffered several  diplomatic reverses in the current year, the Government of India  is planning new initiatives in the new year to neutralise the  negative impact abroad of many internal political developments  that have put the country on the defensive.    Since the Prime Minister has been discharging the duties of  the Foreign Minister also on account of Mr. Dinesh Singh's  indisposition, indications are that a change is in the offing in  the stewardship of the External Affairs Ministry. Mr. P.V.  Narasimha Rao now realised that Mr. Dinesh Singh's indisposition  has affected his mobility at a time when India is under severe  pressure internationally on the minorities issue, human rights,  non- proliferation etc. and needs to respond vigorously at all  international forums.    Foreign policy reverses culminated in the cancellation of  the  G-15 summit, about whose objectives the External Affairs  Ministry's top brass was not at all clear. Apart from the  protocol arrangements, not much thought was given to making the  gathering purposeful nor were any new approaches to the problems  of developing countries sought to be defined in an era of new  economic groupings.    The draft declaration approved by the G-15 Foreign Ministers  makes dismal reading and strikes no new path. The three heads  of Government of Indonesia, Zimbabwe, and Malaysia saw the  inadequacy of the document and deferred its consideration. With  senior officials of the External Affairs Ministry having  realised how irrelevant the G-15 had become, nothing could be  done to bring the foreign dignitaries to New Delhi.    The traumatic religio-ethnic experience through which the  country has been passing for over a year, leading to upsurge,  communal violence, bomb blasts of unprecedented severity,  escalated terrorist violence in Kashmir leading to retaliatory  action by the security forces, have had a negative impact on  external relations. The Government has not been able to derive  full advantage from the economic reforms because of political  uncertainty at home, the securities scam which has brought about  the Finance Minister's resignation, the question mark till  recently on the Congress Party's performance in the elections to  the five State Assemblies, escalated extremist violence and  growth of fissiparous tendencies.    Pakistan has taken full advantage of the ethnic situation  and  developments in Kashmir and together with other members of the  Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) forced India into a  defensive position at all international gatherings, including  the United Nations.    The change of administration in the United States has  increased pressure as regards human rights, non-proliferation,  technology transfer, environment and Kashmir, Indo-U.S.  relations received a severe jolt, though both sides are now  playing it cool. However, External Affairs Ministry sources  insist that the Government, while adjusting its foreign policy  to the realities of the new international situation, has  succeeded in protecting India's economic, political and  territorial interests despite adverse circumstances. Even with  regard to technology transfer, the country's had been  safeguarded despite embargos.    "With no country is it possible to have a totally smooth  relationship because we do not toe anybody's line. We have a  structured and calibrated equation with each country. Relations  with others cannot always be smooth because India is a large and  complex country." It is also argued that the Ministry did not  get the political leadership it deserved in such crucial times  when the whole international scenario has changed and old  equations are no longer relevant.    It is admitted that the Prime Minister's personal  initiatives  helped the country to further stabilise relations with China,  Iran, Israel and South Africa the last two were only recently  accorded diplomatic recognition. A whole gamut of possibilities  has opened up with the Central Asian republics, though relations  with Russia are again passing through an uncertain phase after  the cancellation of the cryogenic rocket-engine deal.    In the new year, priority will be accorded to normalising  relations with Pakistan and addressing the Kashmir question and  the exercise will begin with the meeting of the foreign  secretaries of the two countries. The United States has created  enough confusion over Kashmir and even Pakistan is now cool to  suggestions from Washington regarding possible solutions to the  Kashmir issue. It will be India's endeavour to keep the  dialogue with Pakistan going on substantive issues while hoping  that external sponsorship of terrorism in Kashmir will cease.    The reverses suffered by the Bharatiya Janata Party in the  recent Assembly elections have sent out the message that India  will not abandon its secular principles and that a solution of  the Babri mosque controversy will be evolved soon.    The second priority will be to expand relations with the  European Union (EU) with which a political dialogue is to be had  to give additional weightage to the agreement on an upgraded  relationship with it. Most EU members are to be reassured of  political stability in India and also the determination to  pursue market reforms with vigour to attract more investment and  joint ventures which are still at a very low level. High  technology flow also needs to be accelerated.    Relations with neighbours, except Pakistan, are good and  will  be further developed. Attention is being given to resolving the  Ganga waters issue with Bangladesh and a meeting between Begum  Khaleda Zia and Mr. Narasimha Rao is expected to materialise  next year, which may help ease the tension on this score.  Relations with Tehran which is supportive of India's case on  Kashmir, are to develop further and a land link established  between India and the Central Asian republics through Iran for  free flow of trade and commerce.    The pressure on India to sign the NPT [Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty] and subscribe to the MTCR [Missile  Technology Control Regime] which have somewhat abated may again  grow. India is expected to stand firm by its commitment to  universal non-proliferation, as opposed to the discriminatory  regime, and press for a major review of the NPT in 1995. India  is also to make it clear that it will not roll back its missile  development plan in the face of China's missile, including ICBM  capability and Pakistan's IRBM programme, which is backed by  China's technical expertise. Concern over China's arms export  policy is heightened by the fact that weapons flows to Pakistan  (which is soon to be taken off the Pressler book) will increase  Islamabad's belligerence. In view of its desire to expand  economic cooperation with the Asia-Pacific region, India will  seek closer relations with ASEAN countries or terms of greater  liberalisation of it economy. Most ASEAN countries appear keen  to be business with India and strengthen its economy lest China  becomes an economic giant and in future, constitutes a military  threat to the region as a whole.</p>

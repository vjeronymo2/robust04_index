			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sun Shangwu: "Model Cities Set For Urban Reform"] </F>   [Text] The central government has selected 17 cities to  carry out "comprehensive urban reforms' and serve as national  models for how to develop a socialist market system.    The reform package is designed to push forward urban reform  in a comprehensive manner, instead of focusing on only the  business sector, said Guo Shuqing, director of the Comprehensive  Department under the State Commission for Restructuring the  Economic System yesterday in Beijing.    The pilot cities include Changchun, Harbin, Anshan and  Shenyang in Northeast China; Tianjin, Tangshan. Xian and Yantai  in North China: Nanjing, Ningbo, Tongling and Changzhou in East  China; Wuhan in Central China; Chengdu and Chongqing in  Southwest China; and Quanzhou and Guangzhou in South China.    The reforms to be implemented in these cities will focus on  three areas this year.    First is the reform of the property ownership system to  transform State-owned enterprises into modern corporations.  This effort will go hand-in-hand with developing the finance,  real estate, labour and technology markets, the official said.    The second area will be the improvement of the pension and  unemployment insurance systems. At the same time, housing  reform will be hastened by selling houses, raising rents and  building more houses for ordinary salary-earners.    Thirdly, education, science and technology will be reformed  in line with the development of a market economy.    The pilot cities are also encouraged to move faster to  reform  government functions.    Guo stressed that these cities will not enjoy any  preferential treatment.    "Preferential policies are counter to the idea of a market  economy, which requires competition on equal footing and  adherence to international practices," he said.    The 17 cities are located not only in the rich eastern  provinces, but are also in the relatively poor central and  western provinces.    "The purpose of this drive is to speed up reforms in inland  cities and help them get rid of poverty," Guc added.    Guo's commission will be responsible for designing standards  for the model reforms and it plans to set up a liaison  association for mayors of these pilot cities, which is expected  to give them chance to exchange information on their reform  experiences.</p>

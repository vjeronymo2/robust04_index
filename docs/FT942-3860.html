			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Business Travel: Travel at your own risk in China The strains of travel in China have become a rich source of anecdotes, and more than a few apocryphal tales are exchanged by jaded businessmen. Among the more recent 'horror' stories was one involving a McDonnell Douglas MD82 on a flight from Hong Kong to Qingdao on the coast south-east of Beijing. Passengers were alarmed when the pilot of the Eastern Airlines aircraft tilted the wings from one side to the other in an apparent attempt to get fuel running smoothly to the engines. Travellers in China become used to delays in an overloaded network, but they also require nerves of steel. A New Zealand businessman reported that an aircraft in which he was travelling earlier this year made four abortive attempts to take off, before giving up. Passengers are also obliged to endure faulty landings and other mishaps that would be rare in the west. A Chinese safety study found that in the first five months of this year there were 17 such mishaps, including wings scraping the ground on landing. Hijackings are another problem: travellers over China's southern coastal regions stand a fair chance of making an unscheduled detour to Taiwan. Last year, there were no fewer than 10 hijackings to Taiwan.</p>

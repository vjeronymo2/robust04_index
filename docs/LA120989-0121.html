			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> ALLIGATOR IN VAN GIVES OFFICER A SHOCK  </P> <P> It was a suspicious-looking vehicle all right -- especially the live alligator  riding in the back.  </P> <P> Newport Beach Police Sgt. Chuck Olmstead did not realize the gator was alive  until he shined his flashlight into the back of the van, and it did sort of a  "Michael Jackson shuffle" to get out of the way, police said Friday.  </P> <P> Olmstead had taken a peek in the van that was parked outside the Arches  Restaurant and Liquor Store on Pacific Coast Highway near Old Newport Boulevard  on Wednesday night because it looked a little suspicious -- kind of a police  officer's intuition.  </P> <P> But the mystery was resolved a short time later, when up walked the van's  owner, Monte Krizan, a herpetologist from Bloomington, Minn.  </P> <P> Krizan proceed to introduce the officers to Albert the alligator, a 6-foot,  230-pound gentle brute of a lizard who is "very passive," Newport Beach police  spokesman Sgt. Andy Gonis said.  </P> <P> And underneath the platform in the van, Krizan showed them Albert's traveling  companion, an 18-foot snake.  </P> <P> Just vacationing, Krizan explained. And after the police officers had their  pictures snapped posing with the alligator, Krizan was on his way.  </P></p>

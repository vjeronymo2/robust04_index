			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Rafsanjani attacks US at Non-Aligned Summit Iran's President Ali Akbar Rafsanjani acknowledges applause after a speech at the Non-Aligned Movement summit in Jakarta yesterday in which he attacked the US's role in the Middle East. Mr Rafsanjani said that supporters of Israel 'have gained an unprecedented and shameless presence in the region on the pretext of protecting Kuwait' and condemned 'the continuous interferences' by the US in the region, writes William Keeling in Jakarta. Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, said he was perplexed by the 'no-fly' zone in southern Iraq, set up by Washington to protect the Shia community from attack by Baghdad. 'Maybe there are a lot of Shias in America,' he quipped.</p>

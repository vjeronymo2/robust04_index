			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CENTURY LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> FOOTHILL'S DONNELLY WALKS EIGHT, BUT WINS  </P> <P> Kent Donnelly, who constantly strives for high marks, helped Foothill High  School teach Santa Ana Valley another lesson Friday.  </P> <P> Donnelly, a senior who has a 4.0 grade-point average, improved his record to  5-0 by pitching the Knights to a 5-2 Century League victory at Foothill.  </P> <P> The Knights (8-4-1, 5-1-1 in league) have beaten Santa Ana Valley (5-8, 2-5)  four times this season.  </P> <P> Donnelly, a hard-throwing right-hander, limited the Falcons to one hit and one  run in five innings and helped himself with a run-scoring triple in the fourth.  Jason Schwary pitched the final two innings for the save.  </P> <P> Donnelly, who has made an oral commitment to attend USC, struggled with his  control. He walked eight and struck out three.  </P> <P> "He was a little too wild," Foothill Coach Gerry Sedoo said. "He's had a little  trouble with his control the last two outings. I think he's trying to do too  much for the team. He is a good all-around player."  </P> <P> Foothill took a three-run lead in the second after Clint Pearson led off with a  single to left. Shawn Sousa bounced a line drive off Santa Ana Valley pitcher  Jose Arroyo for an infield single and Mark Bablot walked to load the bases. Ron  Kiino, the ninth hitter in the lineup, lined a 3-1 pitch to left to drive in  two runs. Blaine Jones' bases-loaded infield single accounted for the third  run.  </P> <P> Donnelly belted a towering shot over the head of Scott Strong in right-center  field for a triple, driving in Keith Baker. Donnelly scored on a wild pitch.  </P> <P> In other Century League games:  </P> <P> Santa Ana 8, Canyon 6 (9 innings) -- Jesse Rosas had a bases-loaded single for  one run and Daniel Alvarez followed with two-run single to lead Santa Ana (5-8,  2-5). Canyon scored once in the bottom of the ninth. Rosas (4-3) picked up the  victory with five innings of relief, striking out five. Greg Tippin singled,  doubled, tripled, scored twice and had two RBIs for Canyon (6-6-1, 5-1-1).  </P> <P> Villa Park 3, El Modena 0 -- Todd Blyleven pitched a four-hitter with 10  strikeouts and one walk for host Villa Park (7-5-1, 3-4). Alex Vicario stole  home and the Spartans' other runs came on wild pitches. TOM BIRSCHBACH  </P></p>

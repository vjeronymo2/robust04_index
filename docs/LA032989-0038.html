			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE ROUNDUP  </P> <P> In another baseball game:  </P> <P> Mission 17, L.A. City 5 -- Shawn Fontenot was three for four with four runs  batted in and hit a two-run home run in the third inning to lead Mission in a  Southern California Athletic Conference game.  </P> <P> Mission pitcher Jose Garcia had a shutout going into the sixth inning but tired  and gave up five earned runs before being replaced. Mission (6-14, 4-4 in  conference play) moved into third place.  </P> <P> MEN'S TENNIS  </P> <P> Moorpark 7, Pierce 2 -- Since the spring of 1976 there have been as many  presidential elections -- four -- as there have been Western State Conference  losses for Pierce. But Moorpark was not intimidated in the WSC match at  Moorpark.  </P> <P> Darrin Pleasant led the upset, defeating Sang Kim, the defending conference  champion, 7-6, 6-4, in No. 1 singles and teaming with Mike Studebaker to defeat  Kim and Mark Nielsen, 6-4, 6-4, in doubles.  </P> <P> Pierce (9-1) came into the match ranked third in the state. The Brahmas have  won or shared every conference championship since 1976, and fell into a  first-place tie with Santa Barbara with an 8-1 WSC record.  </P> <P> Moorpark, which lost only two singles matches, improved its conference record  to 6-2.  </P> <P> SOFTBALL  </P> <P> Cal State Northridge 2-3, Nebraska 1-2 -- Krista Miller's run-scoring double in  the sixth inning of the second game drove home Heather MacTavish from first  base for a 3-0 lead and the Lady Matadors held on to complete a nonconference  sweep at CSUN.  </P> <P> Pam Smith added a two-run single in the second game. Freshman Christy Alves  pitched two innings for the win.  </P> <P> In the first game, Lisa Erickson twice drove home Lelani Artis to provide  CSUN's scoring.  </P> <P> Debbie Dickmann went the distance for her 16th win in 20 decisions.  </P></p>

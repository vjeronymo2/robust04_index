			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Property helps boosts Wharf to HKDollars 2bn profit WHARF, the Hong Kong conglomerate controlled by the family of the late Sir YK Pao, yesterday reported net profits for 1992 of HKDollars 2bn (USDollars 258m), compared with HKDollars 1.28bn for the last nine months of 1991. The company said that on an annualised basis, profits grew 20 per cent. However, if extraordinary gains are extracted, the rise would have been 14 per cent. A final dividend of 48.5 cents a share was declared, making 65 cents for the year, against 56.5 cents for the previous nine months. Turnover amounted to HKDollars 4.4bn, compared with HKDollars 2.4bn. Wharf has interests in property, hotels, infrastructure, and media, but property development accounted for about 70 per cent of the growth in earnings. The directors said that in spite of uncertainties in Hong Kong, the development of the group's land bank would underpin continued growth in earnings. From now until 1996, it will bring nearly 7m sq feet of residential and office space to market. Mr Peter Woo, chairman, said the group's long-term aim was to commit between 10 and 20 per cent of its assets to China, equal at current balance sheet values to between HKDollars 4.5bn and HKDollars 9bn. Mr John Hung, an executive director, said Wharf was focusing on five locations in China: Hong Kong, Guangdong, Shanghai, Sichuan, and Beijing. It was currently committed to the development of a modern port at Ningpo, the introduction of pay television into Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan, and various property developments in Shanghai. Mr Hung also said Wharf planned to proceed with the introduction of pay television in Hong Kong. Its licence, which has yet to receive Chinese approval, was awarded by the Hong Kong government. He said the venture would require an initial investment of HKDollars 2bn, which Wharf would fund internally. After China had given its formal blessing to the licence it would seek to refinance the investment.</p>

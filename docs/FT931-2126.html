			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Arts: Fabbricini's Tosca - Opera in Berlin The soprano who brought La traviata back to Milan three years ago after a generation's gap was Tiziana Fabbricini, a petite Italian discovered and moulded by Riccardo Muti. Since that triumph, far from flying round the world on Muti's coat-tails, we have heard very little of her - unlike her Alfredo, Roberto Alagna, who made a much-approved Covent Garden debut last season. In the past two months, however, Fabbricini has finally begun to spread her wings, allowing audiences in Berlin and New York to hear her Violetta. The Deutsche Staatsoper in east Berlin also engaged her to sing Tosca, which gave her the chance to prove she is more than a one-role singer. There must have been many like myself who questioned whether Puccini's doughty heroine was the right step forward. In the event, the doubts were swept aside. Fabbricini is the opposite of the Valkyrie breed of Tosca currently prevalent - fragile and feminine, young enough to be naive and impulsive, subtle in her body language instead of relying on Verona-size brush-strokes. She may miss the glamorous hauteur of the prima donna, but she has an authentic stage personality, dramatic and vulnerable. And the way she allows jealousy, romantic passion and anger to flare in quick succession underlines that Tosca is a woman with Latin blood coursing through her veins. The more refined Italian instincts are to be found in her natural projection of words, grace notes and melodic line. She produces remarkable volume for such a small frame, but never volume for the sake of it. The voice itself is very much a matter of taste, which is why Fabbricini is unlikely to make a big recording career: you have to see her to appreciate her. The timbre is not conventionally beautiful. When not in full flood it has a brittle quality that can sound dangerously close to parlando. Yet even in such moments she communicates genuine emotion. Her Cavaradossi was another up-and-coming singer who has yet to make an impact in London - the Latvian tenor Sergey Larin. As befits someone who has already sung Don Carlo at La Scala, he shows good vocal manners, bringing a handsome, even ring to the arias. He also looks presentable, despite some unimaginative acting. Sherrill Milnes, one of his increasingly rare visits to Europe, brought a sense of patrician menace to Scarpia, one of his best-known parts - though the vocal colour is beginning to fade. With three such well-matched principals, Tosca recaptures some of the magnetism we all recall from our first encounter with it. The Staatsoper staging, first produced in German in 1976, provided a glimpse of pre-Barenboim days - simple and serviceable, with strong comprimario singing. The conductor, Eugene Kohn, was about two bars behind everyone else, but the Staatskapelle (on automatic pilot) played well.</p>

Speaking to reporters in the ministry after  attending the weekly cabinet meeting today, he said the British  step is a good sign, but the government decided not to lift the  ban on awarding new government contracts to British companies.    Britain is Malaysia's traditional arms supplier,  particularly  main defense systems and equipment such as warships and  aircraft. Since 1988, Malaysia has bought defense systems and  arms worth over 4 billion ringgit from Britain, while two huge  military projects involving British companies have yet to start.</p>

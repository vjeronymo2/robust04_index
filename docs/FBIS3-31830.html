			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 25 (AFP) -- UN commander for Sarajevo  French General Andre Soubirou on Friday blamed ceasefire  violations here on provocations by the mainly Moslem Bosnian  army.    In a statement read out to reporters by a French officer,  Soubirou said trench digging by Bosnian soldiers drew fire from  Serbs who thought the Bosnians were trying to advance their  lines.    "The cease-fire is overall respected. However some shots  fired break it from time to time," Soubirou said in the  statement read by Major Guy Vinet. "Most often they are the  result of Serb reaction from anxious soldiers who shoot at the  Muslims who dig some trenches regularly. These diggings are a  Bosnian provocation," the statement said.    The ceasefire between Serbs besieging Sarajevo and the  Bosnians defending it was agreed by the two sides on February 9,  the day NATO issued an ultimatum for heavy artillery to be  withdrawn from Sarajevo.    The ceasefire has held and Sarajevo is the calmest it has  been since war began in April 1992. Meanwhile a nation-wide  ceasefire in Moslem-Croat fighting was due to take effect at  1100 GMT Friday.</p>

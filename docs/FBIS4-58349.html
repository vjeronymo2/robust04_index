			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Bisharah Shirbil: "Contacts Pave the Way for </F> Serious Dialogue Between the Lebanese State and 'Awn"]    [Excerpt] London -- Reliable sources have told AL-HAYAH  that the Lebanese state is moving toward opening a serious  dialogue with [former Prime Minister and Army Commander] General  Michel 'Awn with the aim of filling the political vacuum that  occurred after the arrest of Dr. Samir Ja'ja', commander of the  now banned Lebanese Forces.    They added that "the dialogue is beginning through local and  international mediators and Damascus is not distant from that."    They pointed out that "the end of Ja'ja''s role, the  detached  position of the Christians, and the cancellation of Pope John  Paul II's visit to Lebanon have created the feeling that the  current situation cannot continue as solutions in the region  become imminent, and that peace requires internal stability and  a strong Lebanese authority supported by the broadest sectors of  Lebanese society."    The same sources emphasized that "the meeting which took  place between 'Awn and former President Shaykh Amin al-Jumayyil  covered the dialogue issue but there were differences of opinion  regarding the national conference 'Awn intends to convene in  Paris in June. Al-Jumayyil is not expected to attend that  conference, for several reasons."    They added that "contacts made by mediators between 'Awn and  the state have come a long way and the results will be known at  the earliest possible time barring a surprise that would torpedo  the entire process."

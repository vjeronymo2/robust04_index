			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Elderly's mortgage worries Sir, The survey by BMRB for the Building Societies Association referred to by Alison Smith ('Societies hang on to homely image', September 22) may be accurate in its conclusions as to how building societies are regarded by the public. However, it would appear to ignore the feelings of one section, the elderly. In particular, it ignores the feelings of 10,000 to 15,000 old age pensioners who were given mortgages known as equity release schemes in the late 1980s. These were taken up by pensioners with little income to speak of, because of glowing reports by the building societies on how property values would rise over the years. The opinions of financial advisers and building societies have proved disastrous and have left the majority of the elderly concerned, with mortgage debts rolling up at a horrendous rate. The attitude to these problems by the building societies can only be described as callous and intransigent. When the Home Income Plan Support Group raised the matter with the BSA, its deputy director-general responded by denying any liability on the part of the building societies. In time he may well prove to be in error. A B Craven, Home Income Plan Support Group, White Cottage, Elstronwick, Burton Pidsea, Hull HU12 9BP</p>

			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Cambridge Water rises 36% to Pounds 2.94m Cambridge Water Company, which supplies water to the Cambridge area, improved pre-tax profits by 36 per cent from Pounds 2.16m to Pounds 2.94m in the year to March 31. Mr Peter Shaw, chairman, said the high level of capital expenditure in the past three years had provided enough water resources to meet growth in demand for the foreseeable future. From now on, he said, capital expenditure should be at a much lower level and be funded from retained profits. Turnover advanced to Pounds 14.3m (Pounds 12.8m). Earnings worked through at 726p (535p) per share and a final dividend of 115p (70p) is recommended for a 170p (115p) total. Regarding the Sawston Mill case, Mr Shaw said the appeal court found in the company's favour. An appeal by the defending company would be held in the House of Lords on October 11.</p>

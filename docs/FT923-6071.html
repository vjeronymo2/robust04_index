			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Sweden gripped by a crisis of confidence YESTERDAY'S 3 percentage point rise in the Swedish central bank's key marginal interest rate to 16 per cent underlines the gravity of the crisis of confidence shown by the financial markets in the handling of the economy. Observers believe it will provide a breathing space but not a solution. The financial markets have their attention firmly focused on the size of the budget deficit - likely to be SKr140bn (Pounds 13.7bn) or more this year - and the seeming lack of government willingness to tackle the problem. Unless the non-socialist minority government can reach broad agreement this autumn with opposition parties on economic policy the markets believe a solution will not be forthcoming and the outflow of capital, soaring interest rates and a plummeting stock market could persist. Last night the prospects of a political deal looked doubtful. In part, this is because the government of Prime Minister Carl Bildt continues to play down the severity of the crisis. Mr Bildt believes the 'markets are wrong' and ought to appreciate the government is sticking to its bold free market strategy. 'Our problem has been with us all the time since we took office last October', Mr Bildt told the Financial Times yesterday. The deficit will 'come down gradually,' as the economy improves, he says, but the central bank is less sanguine. 'They (the markets) have come back from their holidays and woken up to reality', said a bank official. Mr Bildt lacks an overall majority in parliament and has had to rely on the right-wing populist New Democrats, seen by the markets as unreliable. Last spring the New Democrats caused a setback to the government's budget plans by refusing to agree to the abolition of part-time pensions, and they continue to threaten government policies. What the markets would like is not the government's downfall but a broad economic agreement across the parliamentary spectrum, including the opposition Social Democrats. This approach is now the norm in other Nordic countries such as Denmark. Mr Poul Schluter, the Conservative Danish prime minister, has held power for nearly 10 years by making compromises with opposition parties. The Swedish government and the Social Democrats agree on a substantial number of issues. They both support the present exchange rate policy and rule out any devaluation of the currency. They also want to link the krona to the exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary system as soon as possible. Both agree there must be no further unfinanced tax cuts and they accept broadly the need for more structural change. Responsible Social Democrats, such as their finance spokesman Mr Allan Larsson, call for fiscal prudence and see the deficit as a problem. But many in his party hanker for big spending programmes to cut Sweden's rising unemployment rate. Yesterday Mr Bildt said he wanted 'as broad a political support as possible' for economic policies but personal antipathy between himself and Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the Social Democratic leader, suggests it will be hard to secure any genuine understanding.</p>

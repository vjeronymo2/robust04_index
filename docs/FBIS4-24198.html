			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Stephen Laufer] </F>   [Text] Senior government officials are squaring up for a  battle over control of the intelligence services, ahead of a  presidential proclamation integrating state agencies with those  of the ANC and the former homelands. To be called the National  Intelligence Agency, the new service will operate for an interim  period prior to a fundamental reorganisation of the intelligence  services.    The high-level political tug of war comes amid reports that  President Nelson Mandela has agreed to cede control of  intelligence matters to his deputy, F.W. de Klerk, in an  apparent barter for ANC control of the police and the South  African National Defence Force. Senior sources say "De Klerk is  attempting to grab control of intelligence," with Mandela -- who  is officially minister of intelligence -- still studying the  implications of delegating his authority.    Intelligence officials familiar with the integration debate  are understood to have advised Mandela against including  intelligence in the national unity trade-off. They fear that  unless the intelligence services report to the president, they  could continue to function in a partisan manner. Inclined  towards the NP [National Party] by tradition, they could become  a powerful weapon in De Klerk's hands in the run-up to the next  election.    Senior ANC officials have indicated that structures  currently  being finalised will ensure presidential control of the shadow  services. The new intelligence dispensation is likely to  include four agencies.    Military Intelligence will return to its classic role of  information gathering and analysis on potential threats to the  sovereignty and integrity of the country. Police intelligence  could be restricted to information gathering on criminals,  including international gun runners and drug dealers.    The current premier political intelligence service, the  National Intelligence Service, is to be divided into two  agencies, one responsible for domestic surveillance and  analysis, the other involved in international work. It is  unclear whether any or all of the agencies will have police  powers such as the right of arrest, or whether the German model  of a strict separation of powers will be followed.    A national intelligence co-ordinating mechanism, most  probably a committee made up of the heads of all the agencies,  will report to a state secretary for intelligence in the  president's office. This is likely to be a political appointee,  possibly ANC security chief Joe Nhlanhla if Mandela holds on to  intelligence.</p>

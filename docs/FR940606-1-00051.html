			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA considered a format based on actual emissions from the primer and topcoat application operations. However, the EPA has information that many larger facilities have several hundred spray booths in which primer or topcoat application operations could take place. Monitoring of that many individual emission sources would not be feasible for either the facility or for enforcement of the standards by the EPA or state agencies. In addition, actual emissions would have to be linked to the production rate and the product produced at the facility. The EPA does not have adequate data to quantify emissions based on production or the product produced. Therefore, the EPA rejected this format. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA then considered a limitation on the organic HAP and VOC content (mass of organic HAP and VOC per unit volume) of coating as applied. This format would essentially impose an emission limitation on each source, but allow flexibility in the manner of compliance. Each source would have the choice of using compliant coatings and averaging between compliant and non-compliant coatings. This format will reduce the amount of total organics, is easily enforced with Method 24 for VOC content and manufacturer's data for organic HAP content, and will cap the total amount of organic HAP that a primer or topcoat can contain. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA is also allowing the use of control devices to reduce organic HAP and VOC emissions from primer and topcoat application operations. The format of the standards must ensure that as much of the emissions as practicable are being controlled. The EPA chose a format that specifies the overall control efficiency (capture efficiency multiplied by the removal efficiency) because overall control efficiency is the best representation of the control effectiveness of control devices. It is also easily enforceable since the EPA has published test methods for both capture and removal efficiency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA is proposing to set an equipment standard to reduce HAP emissions from the application of primers and topcoats. This format requires the use of certain specified coating application equipment or coating methods that result in higher transfer efficiencies than conventional spray equipment, thus reducing emissions. This format allows facilities the flexibility to choose the method of application most appropriate to the coating and substrate being coated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA first considered the data presented in the section 114 questionnaire responses to determine the format of the standards for inorganic HAP emissions from primers and topcoats. The level of control (expressed as a percentage) of dry particulate filters and waterwash spray booths was reported in the section 114 questionnaire responses. However, the basis for the reported control efficiency was primarily engineering judgement and manufacturer's data, which could not be verified through standardized testing. While the Act specifies that emission standards be developed whenever possible, the EPA determined that the available data were not of sufficient quality to develop such a standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA then considered an equipment standard that described physical characteristics of high efficiency particulate filters and waterwash systems. However, due to the number of different filter and waterwash systems and variety of designs available, no concise description could be developed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA then developed a format that specified that all primer and topcoat application operations must be conducted in a ventilated booth or hangar equipped with filters or waterwash systems. The selection of the actual filters and waterwash systems would be left to the individual facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Depainting Operation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The demonstrated technologies for depainting that represent the best performing 12 percent of sources are blast methods (e.g., plastic media and wheat starch blasting) and chemical strippers that contain no organic HAP. The EPA considered an operational format for the proposed standards that would require one of these methods to be used. However, many other alternative depainting methods are under development that have the potential to reduce organic HAP emissions as effectively as blasting or chemical strippers that contain no organic HAP. The EPA did not want to limit the development of these alternative depainting methods, so the operational format was rejected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA then considered the level of organic HAP emissions from blasting, chemical strippers that contain no organic HAP, and other alternative depainting methods. With the exception of spot, decal, radome, and parts depainting, all of these methods have the potential to emit no organic HAP. The EPA, therefore, chose an emission standard format that specifies no organic HAP emissions from depainting, with exemptions for spot, decal, radome, and parts depainting. This format would allow the currently demonstrated depainting methods, as well as alternative methods that may be developed in the future. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

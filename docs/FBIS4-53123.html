			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Margarita H. Debuque] </F>   [Text] The country's trade gap widened to $1.663 billion in  the first three months from $1.280 billion in the same period  last year, according to the latest data from the National  Statistics Office (NSO).    The uptick is roughly equivalent to a 30 percent growth.    As before, imports continued to outperform exports. The  import bill grew by 21.9 percent to hit $4.579 billion in March  from $3.756 billion last year. Exports, on the other hand, grew  by just 17.8 percent in the period. The country's export  receipts rang up a meager $2.916 billion in the first quarter.    However, exports are starting to show indications of  catching  up. For March alone, export earnings rose by 24.7 percent to  $1.05 billion, from $842 million the same month a year ago.  Import bills in the same period grew by only 14 percent (to  $1.586 billion).    Month on month, though, imports still outpaced exports. From  February to March, imports grew by 17.7 percent as against  exports which grew by 14.4 percent.    Of the March imports, electronics and components for the  manufacture of semiconductors topped the list. Imports  expenditures reached $186.19 million -- or 10.5 percent higher  than last year's figures -- but declined by 11.9 percent from  the previous month. Electronics and components have together  been the country's number one import for the third consecutive  month.    Power-generating and specialized machinery also took a huge  chunk of the bill. Expenditures on the product amounted to  $176.36 million, or up 10.5 percent from last year. Spending on  capital equipment increased as the government continued to boost  its energy expansion programs. Power-generating machinery  topped the list a year ago, but slipped when the country enjoyed  a breathing spell from power shortage. Imports of the commodity  fell 11.9 percent from February.    Mineral fuels, lubricants, and related materials ranked  third  with imports worth $138.19 million. This value reflected a 7.6  percent decrease from last year's level, and a slight uptick  from the previous month.    Imports of telecommunication equipment and electrical  machinery followed with bills amounting to $120.02 million, down  24.5 percent from $158.89 million in the previous year.    Transport equipment, the fifth biggest import, registered at  $105.38 million, after dropping 55 percent from $67.97 million.    Other major imports include textile yarn, fabrics, made-up  articles and related products ($103.04 million); iron and steel  ($77.51 million); paper and paper products ($73.05 million);  materials and accessories imported on consignment basis for the  manufacture of other electrical and electronic machinery and  equipment ($47.41 million); and, plastics and non-primary forms  ($45.03 million). The ten major imports accounted for 67.6  percent of the total.    Japan and the United States remained the major source of  goods. Shipments from Japan to the Philippines were valued at  $381 million while shipments from the United States were worth  $271 million. Imports from the two countries together took up  41.1 percent of the total import bill.</p>

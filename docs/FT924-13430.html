			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / World Trade News: US-EC farm talks choke on oilseeds TWO days of intensive negotiations in Brussels have failed to resolve the European Community's dispute with the US over the EC oilseed subsidy regime  -the biggest obstacle to settlement of the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation. 'We are still worried about oilseeds, not just because it is the biggest problem, but because there is so little time to settle it,' one trade official said. The EC is unwilling to cut oilseed output below 9.5m tonnes, while US farm lobbies want a 7m tonne ceiling. Nevertheless officials said the Brussels talks had narrowed the gap between the US and the EC on a farm trade dispute that has prevented agreement on wider trade reform for almost two years. Of three disputed issues, two appear to have been resolved in principle  - that on a six-year programme of cuts in the volume of the EC's subsidised farm exports, and on EC demands for compensation payments to European farmers for production cuts to be exempt from wider commitments to cut subsidies for domestic production. The oilseeds dispute, which threatens to erupt into fully-fledged trade war, remains unresolved. Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC Farm Commissioner, and Mr Ed Madigan, his US counterpart, are to meet within a week in a last-ditch effort to reach agreement. Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative who led the US negotiating team, abandoned plans to visit Paris - where opposition to EC concessions has been fiercest - and returned to Washington yesterday. She plans to continue talks with Mr Frans Andriessen, her EC counterpart, at a trade ministers' meeting in Canada at the weekend. In Germany, members of the Bundestag yesterday condemned French efforts to block a Uruguay Round agreement as 'intolerable'.</p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Technology: Microsoft's next big update - How the software maker has responded to customer comments and complaints Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, is set to unveil plans for the next generation of its hugely popular Windows personal computer software in Atlanta, Georgia, next week. Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, plans to demonstrate Windows 4.0 - codenamed Chicago - to the public for the first time and detail plans for its release. Chicago is a big advance on the best-selling computer operating system combination ever - Microsoft's MS-Dos and Windows software. Gates predicts huge sales for Chicago next year. He hopes a 'significant proportion' of the 60m users of Windows will upgrade to the new software. In addition, most PC manufacturers are expected to install the new version of Windows on PCs shipped after the official launch. The date for that is yet to be fixed. But the company expects the product to be available this year. 'Chicago will be the most popular systems (software) update we have ever put out,' says Gates, who comments that he will be disappointed if Chicago does not generate at least Dollars 500m in sales during its first year on the market. The Chicago upgrade package for existing Windows users is expected to sell for between Dollars 50 and Dollars 100. Microsoft suggests several reasons for PC users to buy the upgrade: With the introduction of Chicago, Microsoft will merge its two top selling products, MS-Dos and Windows, into a single PC operating system, providing a better way to harness the power of the latest, high-speed PC microprocessors. Chicago, it claims, will also make PCs much easier to use than either Apple Computer's Macintosh or PCs running existing versions of Windows. The new program will make it easier to hook PCs up to a network. Extensive testing of Chicago indicated to Microsoft that Windows users were often befuddled by crowded, confusing screens and inconsistent commands. So Chicago will look quite different from the existing Windows product. For example, Microsoft found that the Windows Program Manager, File Manager, Windows Setup and Control Panel systems were often confusing to users who did not know where to start when they needed to make changes to the system, by adding hardware or software. These elements have been made simpler and more consistent in Chicago, so that adding a new printer or changing the resolution on screen is much easier. Microsoft has also made major improvements to the basic applications incorporated in Windows, including word-processing, communications and personal information management programs. Yet despite these new elements, Microsoft faces some significant challenges if Chicago is to live up to expectations. To start with, the new look means many users may need retraining to take full advantage of its capabilities. Some PCs used by companies or individuals do not have enough memory or processing power to run Chicago. So corporate PC buyers face the choice of upgrading all their PCs or supporting two generations of PC operating systems. Yet for new PC users and users of recently purchased PCs, Chicago represents a breakthrough in performance and ease of use. With this new version of Windows, Microsoft appears set to maintain its tight grip on the market.</p>

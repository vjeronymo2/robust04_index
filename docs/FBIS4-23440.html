			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Tunisia is preparing to host the 30th African  summit, which opens on 13 June. In preparation for this summit,  the 60th session of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the OAU  member-states opened in the capital today.    In the opening session, Benjamin Bounkoulou, chairman of the  former council and Congolese foreign minister invited the  delegation of the Republic of South Africa to take the seats  reserved for it, noting in so doing the country's officially  joining the OAU.    Prime Minister Hamed Karoui delivered the official speech at  the opening session. [passage omitted] The prime minister  talked about the dire need for African states to notice jointly  the changes witnessed by the world today, as well as the  development of blocs and groupings, so as to move from a period  of following events to one of having an impact on them and of  holding the reigns of initiative in order to safeguard our  interests and continue our contribution to the development of  human civilization.    The prime minister said that the OAU remains the best  framework for uniting our ranks, shouldering our efforts,  defending our rights and interests, and imposing the status we  deserve on the international arena, particularly as the present  OAU foreign ministers' session is taking place at a critical  stage in the history of our continent and that of our  contemporary world.    The prime minister pointed out that the priority of  priorities on which the Africans' efforts must be applied is the  achievement of peace, development, and cooperation.  Responsibility compels us to deal with our internal situation  with all decisiveness by adopting political and social reforms.  Every state must find the suitable method for its situation so  as to deepen its reforms by avoiding the dangers lying in wait  for democracy, such as religious extremism and tribal conflict.

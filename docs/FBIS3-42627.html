Formed in November 1992, the Commodity Producers of Russia  Federation unites federal, republic, kray, and oblast branch  unions, associations, and other combines of commodity producers.  Its founders include the Association of Industrialists and  Entrepreneurs of Russia, the Agrarian Union of Russia, the  League of Assistance to Defense Enterprises, the Russian Union  of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, and the Russian Union of  Labor Collectives. The congress adopted a decision on membership  of the FTR for the Union of Oil Industrialists and the Trade and  Industry Chamber of Russia.    The forum delegates adopted in respect to the results of the  work a Declaration on the Rights of Commodity Producers of the  Russian Federation.    In accordance with a resolution of the congress, the  Federation Council Presidium was instructed to convey to the  president of the Russian Federation and the Federal Assembly and  Government of Russia the main proposals and demands of the  congress.    As follows from the documents of the congress and the debate  conducted within its framework, the FTR's main goals for the  transitional period are protection of the rights and  representation of the interests of the combines of commodity  producers of Russia in the organs of state power and  administration, furtherance of the development of domestic  industry, the agrarian sector, and enterprise and the formation  of a system of social partnership, and the enhancement of the  social prestige and the revival of the historical traditions of  Russia's commodity producers.    The by-laws of the federation, which were approved by the  Second FTR Congress, have now been registered with the Ministry  of Justice of the Russian Federation.    In accordance with an instruction of the congress, FTR  Chairman Yuriy Skokov will hold consultations with the  Government of Russia, the leaders of factions of deputies of the  Federal Assembly, the leaders of political parties and  grassroots movements and organizations, and entrepreneurs for  the formulation of a concerted position on questions of  socioeconomic policy taking account of the interests of the  commodity producers.  <H3>  Declaration of the Rights of Commodity Producers of the  Russian Federation </H3>   We commodity producers, enterprise outfits, managers  (directors), and entrepreneurs--all who are employed in the  sphere of commodity production, regardless of forms of  ownership, types of economic activity, and political  persuasion--affirm that:    --the building of a democratic federal state based on the  rule of law is possible only on condition of the reform of the  economy for the creation of efficiently functioning commodity  production;    --the chosen model of radical economic transactions in  Russia  has brought about a progressive decline in commodity production  and increased crisis. Account is not being taken of the fact  that the entire infrastructure of the country's industrial,  technological, and scientific and technological potential was  formed under fundamentally different conditions and that for its  adaptation to a truly market environment a transitional period  is necessary.    The fundamental goal of the reforms--a rise in Russians'  living standard--is being sacrificed.    The Federation advocates the implementation of reforms and  sets as its goal recognition and protection of the rights of the  commodity producers based on self-organization and the  harmonization of their interests in the process of reform of the  economy.  <H3>  The Commodity Producers Federation, Recognizing Its  Responsibility to the Country and Society, Declares: </H3>   --its right to conclude a master agreement with the  government of the Russian Federation enshrining a qualitatively  new system of mutual relations in the implementation of economic  transformations for the creation of efficient commodity  production;    --its right to devise and sign as quickly as possible with  the organs of state power of components of the Russian  Federation regional agreements for the formulation of the  optimum mutually acceptable mechanisms of economic reform  locally;    --its right to participate in the elaboration of all  legislative instruments and enforceable enactments concerning  commodity production and to submit them for consideration to the  Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation and other organs of  state power in accordance with current legislation;    --its right to assurance by the state of protection of the  vitally important interests of the commodity producers as an  essential condition of the preservation and strengthening of  Russia. The state's self-withdrawal from the accomplishment of  the tasks of support for domestic commodity production is  impermissible;    --its right to support by the state for the priorities of  the  domestic commodity producers in the process of privatization. We  are opposed to the rash redistribution of the national wealth to  the detriment of the vast majority of the population;    --its right to a long-term state protectionist policy in the  interests of the domestic commodity producers. We support  Russia's active inclusion in the world market in the interests  of the national economy, but we are opposed to the conversion of  our fatherland into a raw material appendage of the developed  countries;    --its right to participate in the creation of a  comprehensive  system of social protection of the commodity producers.    The Federation will uphold and defend the rights of the  domestic commodity producers within the framework of current  legislation in interaction and cooperation with organs of  federal and regional power and administration and with all  domestic organizations and movements expressing the interests of  business circles and the work force.  <H5>  P.S. </H5>   A lengthy meeting between Yuriy Skokov and Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin was held recently. The meeting discussed  problems of Russia's economic and social development, ways of  extricating commodity production from the profound crisis, and  questions of support for the interests of the commodity  producers. As reported by information sources within the  government, the discussion was of a constructive nature.    Yuriy Skokov also met with members of the government and  also  leaders of certain factions of deputies.</p>

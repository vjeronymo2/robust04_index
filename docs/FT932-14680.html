			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Rates on vacant premises at Pounds 574m BUSINESSES IN England and Wales paid Pounds 574m in rates on empty property last year, nearly 5 per cent of the total business rate bill, new statistics show. This is a sharp rise over previous years, in line with the large increase in the number of vacant commercial properties. Most of the revenue came from London, where the Pounds 353m of rates charged on unoccupied buildings was nearly 9 per cent of the total London commercial rates bill. The rising bill for rates on empty property, which is levied at half the cost of occupied property, has become an increasingly heavy overhead for landlords and those tenants that have been unable to find new occupiers for unneeded premises. Some landlords have escaped paying rates on empty buildings by stripping out services to make their buildings uninhabitable. This option is not open to tenants, many of whom are facing problems sub-letting unwanted space. The statistics, which were not previously compiled, were put together by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation. The body is lobbying the government to cut the empty-rates liability from 50 per cent of the normal levy to 25 per cent. It is also asking the government to extend the grace period when occupiers are excused from paying rates from three months to 12 months after they have moved out of their premises.</p>

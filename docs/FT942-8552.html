			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / More competition complaints The European Commission is receiving more and more complaints about restrictions on competition, its annual report on competition for 1993 reveals. Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, said complaints had doubled since 1980, and the trend was likely to accelerate as companies insist on a level playing field in the single market. In particular, the commissioner took aim at restrictions in competition in Europe's energy market. Mr Van Miert promised to press ahead with efforts to create a single market in energy which was lagging behind telecoms liberalisation. Commission officials hope that private sector complaints could be a tool for attacking state monopolies, particularly powerful operators in the gas and electricity industry. In 1993, the Commission eliminated its backlog of old competition cases. Some 1,250 cases involving cartels or abuse of a dominant position were being examined on December 31, 1993, compared with a little under 1,700 a year earlier. Mr Van Miert signalled that the Commission is examining how to develop the idea of a common competition area extending to prospective EU members in eastern Europe.</p>

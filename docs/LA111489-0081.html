			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EUROPEAN FIRM BUYING COMBUSTION ENGINEERING  </P> <P> Combustion Engineering Inc., a diversified international manufacturing and  service concern, said Monday that it agreed to be bought by a European  industrial conglomerate for $1.6 billion.  </P> <P> ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd., a Swiss-Swedish supplier of technical equipment and  services, will pay $40 each for all of Combustion Engineering's outstanding  shares in a tender offer to start later this week.  </P> <P> Combustion Engineering stock surged $13.50 a share to close at $39 in heavy  trading on the New York Stock Exchange, with analysts saying that they expect  the European company to succeed with its friendly takeover bid.  </P> <P> The transaction is not subject to financing, the announcement said.  </P> <P> "They are paying top dollar for it," said analyst George Gaspar at Robert W.  Baird Inc., who noted that the offer was high enough to discourage any  potential rivals.  </P> <P> Combustion Engineering evolved from a New Jersey company called the Locomotive  Superheater Co., founded in 1910, into a provider of high-tech industrial  products such as computerized controls for plants.  </P> <P> It restructured after its primary business of selling power plant equipment and  services went into a decline in the early 1980s and has been successful selling  the technology internationally. Some 40% of its sales come from abroad.  </P> <P> ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd., a supplier of electrical equipment and services for  industry, has annual sales of about $20 billion and is owned by Sweden's Asea  AB and the Swiss-Swedish Brown Boveri et CIE AG.  </P> <P> Combustion Engineering, which supplies the power generation, process and public  sector markets, had 1988 sales of about $3.5 billion.  </P> <P> The company said the offer will be subject to a number of conditions, including  the tender of shares representing at least 80% of the outstanding stock.  </P> <P> A definitive merger agreement was approved by directors of both companies.  </P></p>

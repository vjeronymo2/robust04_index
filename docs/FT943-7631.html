			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Lac's last line of defence removed Lac Minerals, the Canadian mining group which is the target of two unwelcome takeover offers, will be forced to dissolve its protection plan, or poison pill, if either of the bids is accepted by its shareholders. The Ontario Securities Commission said after two days of hearings that it will order Lac to remove the poison pill if either of the rival suitors, the Toronto-based gold producer American Barrick or Royal Oak Mines of Vancouver, attracts more than 66 per cent of Lac's shares. Royal Oak's CDollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.1bn) bid is due to expire tomorrow, while Barrick's CDollars 2.1bn offer expires on Friday. Both are conditional on acceptance by holders of two-thirds of Lac's shares. The poison pill allows Lac's directors to issue large amounts of stock to existing shareholders at a deep discount in the event of a predator acquiring a stake of more than 15 per cent. Lac has so far tried to convince shareholders that their interests would be best served by allowing it to remain independent. Mr Jim Pitblado, chairman, told the OSC that Lac has talked to other potential suitors, but that it could be two or three weeks before another bid materialises. He declined to give details of these talks. Royal Oak and Barrick contend that Lac's directors have had enough time to find a 'white knight' since Royal Oak made its first offer on July 7. According to the two suitors, Lac's shareholders should now be allowed to decide the company's fate. Analysts give Barrick a higher chance of success than Royal Oak, despite the lower face value of its bid. Both companies have offered a combination of cash and shares, but Barrick's paper is widely regarded as more attractive and liquid than Royal Oak, which is a much smaller company with relatively high-cost mines. Royal Oak raised the cash component of its offer earlier this month. The fact that Barrick has not responded is taken as a sign that Mr Peter Munk, its chairman and controlling shareholder, remains confident of most Lac shareholders' support.</p>

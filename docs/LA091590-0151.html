			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Capizzi -- Remarks of Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi were characterized  incorrectly in a story Friday about the Amber Jefferson case.  </P> <P> The story mistakenly said Capizzi had criticized black community leaders. In  fact, Capizzi's remarks were not directed specifically at blacks, he said, but  "collectively" at all of the people who had accused his office of mishandling  the case.  </P></p>

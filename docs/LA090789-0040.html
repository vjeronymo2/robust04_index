			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Hal Who?: Actor Hal Linden finds that he is probably eternally typecast as  "Barney Miller," the laconic New York police captain of the popular 1975-82 TV  series. At a recent celebrity golf tournament in Vail, Colo., his golf clubs  seemed to have disappeared in the clubhouse. Linden said they were finally  found by the manager, who admitted with some embarrassment that they were  stored under "Miller." "As long as they know me some way, I don't mind," said  Miller . . . er, ah, Linden. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mahmud Bakri] </F>   [Text] According to reports, in the ongoing battles in  Yemen the two warring factions are using modern types of weapons  that were not previously in the Yemeni arsenal. Our information  confirms that the value of the weapons that have entered Yemen  recently totals $1 billion and that these weapons have flowed  into Yemen from various U.S., European, and Israeli arms  companies. The reports say that Israel exploited the  complications of the Yemeni crisis and shipped these weapons to  Yemen via several African countires, including Uganda and Zaire.    Reports also say that there are secret alliances between  certain Yemeni tribes and Israeli military personnel stationed  in these African countries. The reports add that an Israeli  military committee left for a tour of these countries early in  February where they met with Yemeni tribal leaders. Under an  agreement reached between the two parties, these Yemeni figures  became responsible for shipping the arms to Yemen across Yemeni  borders with certain Arab countries. The reports say that $2.1  billion has flowed into Yemen from abroad with the aim of  consolidating the division.    The reports affirm that the Pledge and Accord Document which  was signed in Amman on 20 February raised deep concern among  foreign circles opposed to Yemeni unity. The Israeli Cabinet  studied the Document on 28 February and realized that it augers  well for Yemeni unity. They therefore considered that it posed  a danger to Israeli security in the Red Sea and the Horn of  Africa and that Yemeni unity might affect Israeli movements in  the Red Sea littoral countries in Africa.</p>

			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: My shares in my name I hold ordinary shares in a company in which shares are dealt in under Rule 535(2) - ie, a 'matched bargain' basis. The company operates an employee share scheme. For the purposes of this, a value of the shares to be issued is agreed with the Inland Revenue each year. I spent my working life with this company but am now retired. I wish to retain the balance of my shares and anticipate that, one day, they may yield a significant capital gain. I therefore wish, in annual stages, to move my holding into an 'own choice' personal equity plan. Would a sale of shares, and their immediate re-purchase into an own-choice Pep at a price demonstrably in line with present transactions in the company's shares, be acceptable to the Inland Revenue? Can such a transaction be executed by my stockbroker without any risk of his 'losing' the shares to a third party in the process? In order to transfer your shares directly into a single company Pep, the Revenue must be satisfied that they have been acquired from an approved all-employee, savings-related share option scheme. A scheme which is restricted to, say, directors would not be acceptable. The Revenue booklet IR 98 will give you more information and can be obtained by writing to the Revenue at Somerset House, London WC2. The transfer into the single company Pep must take place within 90 days from and including the date that you direct the trustees of the scheme to transfer the ownership of the shares to yourself, or direct to the Pep manager. The price must be the open market value of the shares for the date on which the transfer takes place. The transactions can be achieved without any risk of 'loss' because, if the time scale is adhered to, there would be no change of beneficial ownership.

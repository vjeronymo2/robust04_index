			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Lloyd's syndicate expects losses to exceed Pounds 100m ONE OF the most highly rated syndicates at the Lloyd's of London insurance market yesterday reported that its 1990 loss would exceed Pounds 100m - about twice the estimate reported by syndicate managers less than five months ago. The extent of the problems of syndicate 745 will increase concern among Names - the individuals whose capital supports underwriting - that Lloyd's overall deficit for 1990 could reach the 1989 total of Pounds 2bn. KPH Underwriting Agencies, which manages the syndicate, expects losses to be between Pounds 108m and Pounds 129m. This compares with the syndicate's stamp capacity - capital base - of Pounds 43.1m. In October KPH said losses would be between Pounds 36m and Pounds 60m. The syndicate's 1,750 Names could lose up to Pounds 30,000 for each Pounds 10,000 share in the syndicate. Unlike many other syndicates which specialised in catastrophe and 'spiral' reinsurance - in which syndicates and companies reinsure each other's high-level catastrophe exposures - 745 was widely respected among underwriters and brokers. The syndicate attracted 377 so-called 'working Names', partly because of the reputation of underwriter Mr Dave King who resigned when news of his own losses emerged last year. Mr Andrew Elliot, the syndicate's active underwriter, who took over from Mr King, said recent claims from hurricane Hugo, which hit the Caribbean and southern US in 1989, and the European storms of January 1990 had been heavier than expected.</p>

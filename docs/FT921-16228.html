			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Letter (2): Retail standards: while cheerful experts exist, others are missing a competitive trick Sir, Thank God someone finally put into print what many many others have felt about the retail standards. I literally had to hold back from laughing aloud while reading Samuel Brittan's article. Unfortunately this was a laugh of desperation - agreeing on the frustrations, but knowing that this will probably never change while I'm alive (presumably I'll have died while waiting in one queue or another]). There are two separate causes of this particularly British problem that I find hard to fathom: The complete lack of realisation by the retail sector that a happy and satisfied customer tends to buy more products and services; and Members of the British public continue to complain about poor service, not to the management of the retail business, but to themselves. Then, in an almost masochistic manner, continue to shop at those same stores where they are treated so poorly] The message is 'Don't complain to yourself, but to management and then vote with your feet]'. If one store treats you poorly, tell the management and don't shop there again. Find another that does treat customers as they should - the most important ingredient to any business - and reward that business with your custom. I realise that this is can be very difficult to do but it should be attempted at all times, otherwise things will never change. As business is really only a reflection of the public's wants and needs, you will then find that the level of service will increase as retailers realise that they cannot continue to attract custom with the present state of appalling service to the British public.

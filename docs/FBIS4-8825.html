			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sandor Lezsak, executive chairman of the </F> Hungarian Democratic Forum, by Janos Papp in Budapest; date not  given: "Sandor Lezsak on the MDF, Politics, Press"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Papp] What are the chances  for the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] in the elections?    [Lezsak] A third of our candidates have a real chance to  make it into parliament, and a few candidates might also get in  from the next third. According to my estimates, more than 60  individual MDF candidates will receive the voters' confidence,  and they will be strengthened by the candidates successful on  the lists. I have confidence in the election success of the MDF  because, in the preparation for the campaign, our candidates  visited many households and made contact with people; we set up  the election offices, and we will slowly catch up with the  Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] in organization.    [Papp] Some people claim that the MDF started its campaign  too modestly. This is a tough and dirty struggle, and other  parties carry out their campaign in this way. Why is the MDF so  withdrawn?    [Lezsak] The MDF does not agree with a styleless struggle;  both our leadership and our members clearly declared this at the  very beginning. Our election posters do not irritate anyone,  and we thank the citizens for their confidence and calm of four  years, because the voters also contributed to Hungary being the  most stable country in the region. The opposition parties will  also realize sooner or later that all that glitters is not gold,  and I mean by this that it is not sure that the foreign campaign  experts employed by them are aware of the Hungarian reality. In  fact, the final election results will tell which party has the  real experts. [passage omitted]    [Papp] According to the political signs, it may happen that  no party will form a coalition with the MSZP, if they get into a  position to form a government. What happens in that case?    [Lezsak] New parliamentary elections will probably be  called, but today no one can even forecast the results of the  elections in May; nor can anyone say for sure which party will  be the final victor. The MDF has huge resources. Take some 40  percent of the voters: These people are watching domestic  political developments with silent passivity. Their votes could  be decisive and, therefore, the MDF also hopes to get a lot of  votes from this group, because every person of goodwill knows  that the MDF has carried out predictable political activity over  the past four years, and the party's program is a guarantee that  we will continue the policy begun by the late Jozsef Antall.    [Papp] Let us suppose that, contrary to all expectations,  the MDF does not have the success that you envisage. Will this  lead to personal consequences?    [Lezsak] Our chances of winning are increasing and, no  doubt, the MDF will play a determining role in the new Hungarian  parliament and Government. However, if things turn out  differently, this will not be the end of the world, because a  process of internal cleansing would start and, as a result, we  would really have the opportunity to get to know the people. It  is more than probable that many careerists would turn their  backs on us and would try to get close to other parties. This  would not be anything special, because this is also part of  life.

			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / ANC admits camp brutality The African National Congress released a report yesterday saying at least 22 people were executed, murdered or beaten to death in its detention camps in Angola and Tanzania, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. The ANC leader, Mr Nelson Mandela, who ordered the inquiry, said the organisation was taking it very seriously. 'The very fact that we have taken the public into our confidence about the report . . . which has found that serious violations of human rights have been committed, is an indication of our good faith.' The report documented executions, torture, beatings and human rights abuses against ANC members held in camps. It said 15 people were executed by ANC firing squads.</p>

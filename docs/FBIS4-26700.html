			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Danielle Yang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 25 (CNA) -- The Finance Ministry has  decided to allow Taiwan banks easier access in doing business  with mainland Chinese banks, a ministry official said Saturday  [25 June]. Under the new measure, Taiwan banks' overseas  branches will be allowed to do business directly with Mainland  China's overseas branches, and will no longer have to go through  foreign banks' overseas branches, the official said.    Overseas branches of Taiwan banks can also do business  directly with foreign banks' mainland branches.    Previously, Taiwan banks wishing to do business with  mainland  banks had to first go through foreign banks' overseas branches  and then through foreign banks' mainland branches.    The Finance Ministry is expected to submit the new measure  during a meeting on July 4, the official said.</p>

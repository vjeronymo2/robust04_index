			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SOVIET JOINT VENTURES FARE POORLY  </P> <P> More than 1,000 foreign firms have created formal joint ventures with Soviet  partners, but many of the enterprises have failed to start up and some have  gone bankrupt, the Tass press agency said today.  </P> <P> Tass said the Finance Ministry has registered 1,284 joint ventures, with a  total charter capital of more than $3 billion.  </P> <P> Half of the Western investment in joint ventures went into light industry and  service establishments, it said. Another 20% was invested in industrial  services such as marketing, engineering and maintenance, and about 15% was  committed to heavy industry and machine tools.  </P> <P> But Tass said the ventures were frequently plagued by legal, financial and  organizational problems.  </P> <P> "The number of joint enterprises that have not begun operations is very high.  There are cases when they go bankrupt or dissolve," Tass said.  </P></p>

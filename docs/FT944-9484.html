			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: ICI gets triple boost Chemicals leader ICI was one of the stronger performers among the FT-SE 100 constituents yesterday as the company's joint broker turned bullish and the market focused on the phenomenal rises in raw materials of which ICI is the main UK manufacturer. Also, investors picked up international earners ahead of an expected US decision on interest rates. ICI climbed 16 to 771p. Broker SG Warburg joined the majority of UK investment houses by moving to 'buy' from 'hold'. Analyst Mr Paul Milchrist refused to comment on the rationale behind the move, but it was believed to have been prompted by the fall in the share price since third-quarter figures in October that were accompanied by a sharply raised earnings forecast. The shares received a further boost from comments made during the profits announcement from Wardle Storeys, a big user of PVC. The company, which makes items such as trim and seat- covering for the car industry, said it had budgeted for price rises of at least 40 per cent in the six months from the start of September, and Wardle fell 24 to 371p on concern over the squeeze in profit margins. ICI's involvement in PVC is modest, but analysts responded to the overall boom in commodities - Smith New Court expressed its support at the afternoon meeting. Finally, many investors were alighting on leading dollar earners in anticipation that the US Federal Open Market Committee might raise its key Fed Funds rate today. Any increase would stimulate support for the US currency. Dollar strength also helped pharmaceuticals group Glaxo bounce 10 1/2 to 619p. The shares were further encouraged by reports that a new anti-viral drug being developed by the company had been effective in fighting Hepatitis B.</p>

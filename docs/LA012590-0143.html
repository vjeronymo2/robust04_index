			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN KILLED BY GUNMAN IN PANAMA;  </P> <P> CRIME WAVE: A SPREE OF ATTACKS AND ROBBERIES IS 'MUCH WORSE' THAN UNDER  NORIEGA, AN OFFICIAL SAYS.  </P> <P> A senior American employee of the Panama Canal Commission was killed Wednesday  in the latest in a series of brazen attacks that have pushed the rate of  violent crime here to levels unknown under the regime of Manuel A. Noriega.  </P> <P> Authorities said they could detect no political motive behind the murder of the  commission's acting financial officer, William J. Joyce, who was shot by a  masked intruder Tuesday night during a theft of guns and jewelry from his home  near the mouth of the Panama Canal.  </P> <P> The attack came less than two days after a similarly violent assault on another  U.S. citizen in the same neighborhood. It added to a spree of assaults and  thievery that has included incidents in which teams of men armed with automatic  weapons made off with $100,000 during a daylight bank robbery and forced  terrorized patrons at two posh restaurants to hand over their money and  jewelry.  </P> <P> In an interview with The Times, the commander of the new Panamanian Public  Force, Col. Eduardo Herrera Hassan, blamed the extraordinary wave of violence  on what he said are hundreds of dangerous criminals who remain at large after  being freed from Panamanian jails during the U.S. invasion.  </P> <P> A U.S. official said an additional 300 former Panamanian soldiers who have not  yet been accounted for also could represent a serious criminal threat.  </P> <P> While no comparative statistics are available, Herrera declared in an interview  that the rate of assaults, murders and other crimes in recent weeks has been  "much worse" than under the Noriega regime. He complained that his troops'  effectiveness in rounding up fugitives and countering the crime wave has been  limited by government restrictions that prohibit them from carrying rifles or  other automatic weapons.  </P> <P> The new indication of a more dangerous Panama contrasts with the image of  tranquillity painted by U.S. officials. American military police continue to  patrol the streets in jeeps while shifting much of their authority back to  their Panamanian counterparts.  </P> <P> The outbreak of violence, in a nation in which the brutality of the old  Noriega-led Panama Defense Forces deterred much street crime, raises new  questions about the consequences of the tentatively planned U.S. withdrawal of  its troops from the capital by next Thursday.  </P> <P> The warning by Herrera of the dangers posed by the roaming convicts provided  the first official accounts of how little success U.S. and Panamanian  authorities have had in rounding up the inmates who were set free during the  invasion.  </P> <P> In the city of Colon alone, Herrera said, 389 of the 400 prisoners let go by  the Panamanian prison warden remain at large. Indicating that the problem is of  similar gravity across Panama, he declared: "The great majority of the  prisoners who were freed during the invasion have not been captured."  </P> <P> A U.S. source said that in addition to those who escaped from Colon, at least  250 more convicts are still on the lam, including 104 of the 160 prisoners who  fled the notorious Coiba Island penal colony while American troops were taking  control of the facility. Among the remainder, the source said, are more than  100 who escaped from the Carcel Modelo jail in Panama City.  </P> <P> Herrera made his comments about the connection between escaped prisoners and  crime before the shooting of Joyce occurred. Sources close to the investigation  said Wednesday night there was no indication that an escaped convict was  responsible for the attack.  </P> <P> The attack made Joyce the first American to be killed in Panama since the  invasion, which claimed the lives of 23 U.S. soldiers and three civilians, as  well as 202 Panamanians. A Panama Canal Commission spokeswoman said, however,  that the close-knit community of about 2,700 American employees has suffered  from an unusual outbreak of muggings and other crimes against U.S. employees  since the invasion, and she reported that environmental control officer David  Baerg had been assaulted and robbed by an intruder in his home at daybreak  Monday.  </P> <P> According to an account provided by the spokeswoman, Willie K. Friar, the  attack on Joyce occurred Tuesday evening when a young Panamanian man rang the  doorbell of the American's home in the affluent La Boca neighborhood and asked  for Joyce's son by name.  </P> <P> When Mildred Joyce, the victim's wife, opened the door, a second man, wearing a  mask and wielding a revolver, emerged from a hiding place and the two entered  the home together. As Joyce rose from his living-room chair, the gunman shot  him in the chest.  </P></p>

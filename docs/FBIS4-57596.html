			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ismael Merida read by Angel De la Guardia </F> Hernandez; from the "Evening Information Review" newscast]    [Text] Greetings to all. Determined to make the best use  of the days left in May and however many work shifts it takes  June, Cuban sugar producers at their daily tasks confirm that  the harvest battle can be won with less than half the resources  required in previous years. Sugar workers confirm with their  daily actions during this tense and difficult final, lap that  the commitment to fulfill the sugar plan is irreversible and  will be maintained.    Good examples of this are Havana and Guantanamo Provinces,  the first to fulfill their respective sugar production plans.  Other good news is that Sancti Spiritu Province, one of the  country's largest, is about to join the vanguard with its stable  and secure work.    Rain, blessed when in season, has not beat down the Cuban  sugar producers' will to win. They understand the urgent need,  for the sake of the country's economy, to cut and mill all  available sugarcane and to not stop until the projected volume  of sugar has been reached. Cuban sugar producers are aware that  working in a very humid environment is not someone's whim and  that there is no alternative but to further increase efforts and  organization to process raw material that still remains in the  fields, doing so with maximum efficiency.    The strategy now is to not limit industrial capacity,  maintain a high level of productive combativeness, and not  become frustrated with the rain, no matter how heavy it seems.  The harvest, as Sugar Industry Minister Nelson Torres has said,  must be viewed as a whole and unique industry which belongs to  Cuba. That is why available resources are assigned to the  center with the milling capacity.    Together with this battle, which is of unique economic  importance to Cuba, there is intense work in sugarcane  agriculture, especially in sowing and cleaning fields. A  satisfactory national amount was reached during January to  April, when approximately 6,000 caballerias of gramineae were  sowed, with Camaguey Province standing out in this priority  task. The amount of hand cutting during this stage is also  worth noting.    In Cuba, sugarcane recovery is something like the main dish  on the sugar menu. It is only logical that the increased yield  per hectare should attract all the attention at this time of the  year. But now, more than ever, these jobs must be carried out  without neglecting what belongs to the sugar industry after more  than 160 work shifts of daily work.    Cuban sugar producers, in cooperation with support groups,  fight, invent, recover, work. They do not fold their arms; they  see in old spares that were previously considered useless  everything that can be made useful once again. This is the  picture that has been painted; this is the reality of a period  that demands attitudes such as these. Hard days pass, but the  number one priority is victory.</p>

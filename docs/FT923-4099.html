			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / World Trade News: The mist on Russia's window - St Petersburg's port is uneasy with enhanced role ST PETERSBURG was built as Russia's 'window on Europe'. Three centuries later the city still serves that purpose but the window is in danger of jamming half-shut and the panes are misting up. The importance of St Petersburg as Russia's maritime gateway to Europe has increased since the dissolution of the Soviet Union deprived the country of direct access to most of its warm-water ports. But the city's ability to rise to the challenge has been limited by capacity constraints and a dearth of development finance for expansion. For centuries Russia's statesmen fought wars to ensure the country retained access to ports which did not ice up. But this strategic goal was reversed almost overnight by the break-up of the Soviet Union. A study prepared by the St Petersburg-based Baltic Shipping Company found that Russia had lost direct access to almost half of the 37 ports serving the European part of the Soviet Union. Just at the time when Russia was attempting to re-integrate itself in the world economy, its goods-handling capacity was cut from 381.8m tonnes to 148.9m tonnes a year. It might be argued that this would not matter greatly if Russia were able to rely upon open trading relationships with its newly independent neighbours. But such has been the bitterness accompanying the collapse of the Soviet Union that the Baltic states, in particular, have been quick to exploit their new leverage by attaching onerous terms of trade. Russia's pride has been pricked by such actions and its newspapers have argued that the country's future as a great world power is at stake. Grand schemes for extending Russia's port capacity have been proposed. One, devised by the Baltic Shipping Company, envisages the creation of a 180m-tonne 'super-port' in the Gulf of Finland although the proposals have run into a storm of ecological protests. Mr Grigoriy Filimonov, who has been entrusted with developing the plans for the BSC, believes the bulk of the Dollars 19bn financing costs could be provided by joint venture arrangements between western importers and Russian exporters. But Mr Anatoly Bilichenko, the director of the commercial sea port, ridicules such concepts. Sitting in his smart office still decorated with portraits of Marx and Lenin, he says: 'This is a typical example of our old way of thinking. It is communist-style gigantism. Any new money should be invested in improving the capacity of the existing port rather than sinking it into a new location.' Mr Bilichenko argues that the most sensible way forward is to expand the port's facilities and update its outmoded infrastructure. He says that a Dollars 150m investment would enable the port to expand capacity from its current 13m tonnes to 20m tonnes. The World Bank is keen to help develop the port and is likely to earmark part of the Dollars 600m it has available to fund infrastructure development projects. 'The port is a very high priority but how much money it is allocated depends on the Russian government's list of financing requests later this year,' it says. Mr Bilichenko believes that up to Dollars 50m may be forthcoming from the World Bank and the European Community; other funds could be raised from Russian enterprises and private western bank loans. Although the fate of St Petersburg's port is as yet far from clear, the debate about its future provides a fine illustration of the pluralistic pressure group politics that is evolving in Russia. At one time all such investment decisions would have been taken by Moscow ministries with scant regard for local considerations. Now, government officials have to pay heed to the views of local politicians and citizens, journalists and foreign bankers as well as a vociferous green movement. Radioactive sediment, still lying on the floor of the Gulf of Finland after the Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster of 1986, would be stirred up by new building work, the greens claim. They also fear that any accident at the proposed new oil terminal might endanger the cooling systems of the nearby Sosnovyi Bor nuclear power station. But it seems likely that national strategic imperatives are likely to overrule such ecological concerns. Russia's politicians attach high importance to the port's development - Mr Boris Yeltsin, Russia's president, has lent his support to the project while Mr Anatoly Sobchak, the city's mayor, has campaigned vigorously for a string of new port developments. 'We remain Russia's single window on Europe and we must fulfil this function in full measure,' he told the St Petersburg press in June.</p>

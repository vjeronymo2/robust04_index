			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Bank intervention saves franc THE BUNDESBANK and the Bank of France seemed close to winning their battle to avoid a devaluation of the French franc last night as the currency rose sharply against the D-Mark. However, the franc's improved performance on the foreign exchanges encouraged dealers to test the strength of sterling once again, forcing the pound to a record low against the German currency in European trading. The German and French central banks were said to have undertaken light intervention on the foreign exchanges yesterday morning, buying francs, as the currency rose above FFr3.40 to the D-Mark. The franc closed at FFr3.3860 to the D-Mark, nearly 1 1/2 centimes up on the day. In late New York trading, the French currency was trading even higher, at FFr3.3825, which some analysts hailed as a psychological breakthrough for the central banks. However, some dealers took a cautious view, suggesting fund managers have not yet reversed their decisions to sell francs this week. The franc and other European currencies were partly supported by an announcement from the European Commission in Brussels that emergency exchange controls imposed by Spain, Ireland and Portugal are compatible with EC law. Yesterday, the commission broke its self-imposed blackout on comments about the financial markets with a terse two- sentence statement on the legality of the measures. The comments helped to lift the Spanish peseta away from its ERM floor of Pta72.62 against the D-Mark, to close at Pta69.67. The Portuguese escudo closed at Esc89.35 to the D-Mark, above its ERM floor of Esc92.33. However, sterling, suspended from the ERM last week, fell to DM2.5090 in European trading. It recovered to close 0.5 pfennigs down on the day at DM2.5450.</p>

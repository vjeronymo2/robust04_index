			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Arts: Petrified at the wedding - Music theatre / David Murray reviews Mecklenburgh Opera's latest east European experiment THE adventurous Mecklenburgh Opera has a penchant for east European experiments, and now it has staged the 'first performance of a Slovak opera in England'. Petrified - 'Skameneny' in the original - is a sort of ballad-opera in one hour-long, seven-scene act, composed in 1974 by Juraj Benes, who is now 52. The programme-notes assure us that it represented (rather belatedly?) the low state of communal morale after the collapse of the Prague Spring in 1968. What we see, however, is a timeless village-tragedy, rather on the lines of Lorca's Blood Wedding. Hanka, 'a young girl', is just that; Janko, 'a young poet', is the rebellious local romantic (we first see him flinging crumpled-up poems at the villagers, who fail to appreciate them). They connect, run away together  -to widespread disapproval - and disconnect; back at home Hanka is pressed into marrying a much older man; years later Janko makes a dramatic return, and it all ends in grief. Besides the principal pair there are male and female trios of village character-types, who both comment and interfere, sometimes violently. Heroic efforts in the programme-book to explain the sense in which they are all 'petrified' remained opaque. Perhaps Skameneny conveys more to Slovaks. In any case, John Abulafia's production - formal groupings, stereotyped miming of anguish and loss - leaves the progress of the action frustratingly unclear. For all we can see, it is hard to tell just how and even when the unhappy wedding takes place, or what exactly happens when Janko returns. The words might have helped (and Ewald Osers' Englishing was an expert job, as far as one could tell), but except from Richard Halton's outstanding Janko they were mostly indistinguishable. The worst offender was Rebecca de Pont Davies' anxious Mother, whose fine, pungent mezzo - nearly a real contralto, rare nowadays - disgorged scarcely one recognisable English vowel, even at a mere ten yards' distance. But all the singers were regularly foxed by their long-drawn-out lines: again and again, we waited impatiently through an extended 'Maaa' or a 'Teee' for some final consonant to reveal what word we were hearing. Presumably the text sings better in Slovak. It is drawn from poems by the 19th-century Janko Kral, which the composer enlisted in the service of his newly-devised story, and apparently they prompted his music toward ballad-inflections for the first time. But they seem to be self-contained, introspective effusions, not narratives - and Benes supplies no stage-directions: the producer has had to make theatrical bricks with very little straw. The attraction of the piece lies in its music, rather than its clouded action. In post-1968 'Czechoslovakia' (which has just now ceased to be), Benes had minimal access to developments further west; his idiom has grown along post-Bartok paths, untouched by anything as radical as postwar serialism or doctrinaire atonality. The lean score of Petrified touches down, regularly and reassuringly, upon tonal bases. Christopher Baugh's stage-designs offer a close analogy, with traditional Czechoslovak forms copied in arrangements of raw, mass-produced panels and blocks, each blazoned with its factory-code. In tutti the seven-strong instrumental ensemble, including cembalom - here, Anne Manson conducts a first-class band - sometimes goes into strident, dislocated polyphony. On the other hand, whole scenes are accompanied by just one or two players, keening away in ethnic style beneath grateful, expressive vocal lines (especially Patricia Rozario's as the winsomely unlucky heroine). There is enough palpably fresh and consistent character in all this to nullify any fashion-oriented complaint that Benes has missed out on western developments. Mecklenburgh has already commissioned a new Hamlet 'opera' from him (for 1995-96), which is predicted to explore madrigal-territory. One may hope that it will recapture some vital dramatic territory, too. Further performances at The Place, Duke's Road, WC1, on November 28 and 30, December 1, 3, 4 and 5; and another at the Phoenix Arts in Leicester on January 12</p>

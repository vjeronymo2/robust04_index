			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Observer: Slipping The Confederation of British Industry thinks the Accounting Standards Board is acting too quickly in churning out new financial reporting standards, but its own criticisms demonstrate anything but nimble footwork. The arguments might have had a point two years ago, but the ASB has already changed its ways to extend consultation periods and experiment before making its standards mandatory, just as the CBI appears to want. Anyway, the rival Hundred Group of leading finance directors somewhat stole the CBI's thunder several months ago in calling for greater co-ordination and phasing of publications. An 'overload group' has already been established that embraces all the different standard-setting bodies. Moreover, the CBI is suffering considerable memory lapse. It attacks the ASB for producing so many standards, yet three years ago it was calling for the body to tackle many of these very topics.</p>

			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AFTER 30 YEARS, SUN SETS ON 'SUN-UP SAN DIEGO'  </P> <P> KFMB-TV(Channel 8) is canceling "Sun-Up San Diego," a mainstay of local morning  television for almost 30 years, the station announced Thursday.  </P> <P> The last show will air Aug. 10, just a few days short of the show's 30th  anniversary.  </P> <P> Channel 8 also announced it will produce a new afternoon talk show, hosted by  "P.M. Magazine" co-hosts Pat Brown and Dave Hood, scheduled to debut in  October.  </P> <P> Sun-Up producer Pat Elwood will work on the new show, but hosts Kathi Diamant  and Jerry G. Bishop have been given notice.  </P> <P> Sun Up aired live at 8 a.m. until earlier this year, when the station switched  it to 9 a.m., in order to align itself with network programming and to allow  for an early-morning local newscast.  </P> <P> The show "did poorly against well-established talk shows" in the 9 a.m. time  slot, according to Channel 8 vice president Bill Moylan. None of the Sun-Up  staff was available for comment.  </P> <P> "These things happen in this business," Moylan said. "Nothing is forever."  </P></p>

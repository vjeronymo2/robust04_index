"However, I hope the reaction will not only be from the  international community," Klaus said in an interview for Czech  Television this evening. He said the massacre should be the  "last straw" which should force the enemy parties in the former  Yugoslavia to sit down at the negotiating table and "stop  shooting." [passage omitted]</p>

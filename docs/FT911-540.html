			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / International Company News: Continental brushes up its image  -The airline's moves towards regaining financial health A jet in the new Continental Airlines white, blue and gold livery was parked in the humid sunshine at one of the gates of Houston's new international airport terminal last week. It was one of the first 12 airliners to be repainted in the Houston-based carrier's new colours. Over the next three years, the entire fleet of 350 aircraft will be repainted and refurbished as part of Continental's efforts to renew its image and return to financial health. 'We know we are not out of the woods yet, ' said Mr Hollis Harris, the former Delta Airlines president who replaced Mr Frank Lorenzo as chairman of Continental last September. 'It's not going to be easy, but I believe this country needs four or five major carriers in the market place. I believe we will be one of those,' he told journalists flown in from around the world to see Continental's new corporate identity. Since December, Continental has been operating under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code. It sought protection from its creditors to enable it to restructure its heavily indebted balance sheet. It is now in the midst of a complex financial restructuring exercise. Mr Harris hopes it will enable the airline, the fifth largest carrier in the US, to fly out of bankruptcy in the next eight to 12 months. Many US airline analysts believe Continental has a reasonable chance of pulling through, although much will depend on the length and depth of the US recession, the speed and vigour of the recovery in air travel and the success of the company's financial restructuring. Mr Harris said when he landed at Continental he was impressed by the airline's route structure, its staff and its overall potential. 'But the financial situation was worse than I thought', he explained. His original plan was to avoid filing for Chapter 11. He felt this would be bad for staff morale since Continental had already been through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1983 under Mr Lorenzo. Instead, he put several Continental assets up for sale and his former airline, Delta, showed interest in buying Continental's extensive Pacific operations. But with the economy weakening, rising fuel prices and the impact of the Gulf conflict, Delta decided not to go ahead with a substantial offer for the Pacific routes. High fuel prices were also putting pressure on Continental. By December, Mr Harris said, the company decided there was no alternative but to file for Chapter 11. However, Mr Harris adopted a radically different approach to the company's previous Chapter 11 filing. Instead of launching a sweeping programme of job cuts and internal restructurings, he adopted a 'business as usual' strategy. The airline would continue to operate normally, while restructuring its balance sheet. 'The plan was first to make the airline profitable and then work to bring in additional capital to expand the airline,' Mr Harris said. This month Continental reported a deeper first-quarter loss of Dollars 195m. against a profit of Dollars 21m in the first quarter of last year. But Mr Harris maintained the company had operated well since the filing, and with traffic picking up again, he expected the airline to be operating in the black in July. But the financial restructuring poses a considerable challenge. The plan is to convert about Dollars 2bn of unsecured debt into equity to reduce the overall debt burden, including Dollars 2.5bn of unsecured debt and Dollars 4.5bn of secured debt. Continental is also restructuring its aircraft operating and capital leases while painting and refurbishing the fleet. To strengthen further the company's finances, Mr Harris is seeking to raise an additional Dollars 600m in fresh equity. A further Dollars 150m will be raised from the sale to American Airlines of Continental's Seattle to Tokyo route, and the company expects to sell its Chelsea aircraft catering subsidiary for about Dollars 80m. It is also planning to sell a 51 per cent stake in its Air Micronesia operations in the Pacific which is expected to raise Dollars 300m. a big impact on existing shareholders equity. Mr Harris said all present shareholders would see their holdings greatly reduced. This would include Scandinavian Airlines System which has a 16.8 per cent stake in the company and 18.3 per cent of voting rights. But Mr Harris said he expected SAS to invest additional funds in the US airline. Apart from Seattle-Tokyo route and the Air Micronesia transaction, Continental does not intend to make any significant asset sales. Even in the proposed Air Micronesia deal, Mr Harris said Continental would continue to operate the service. The airline already has plans to grow in the Pacific as well as in Europe. It already provides more services to Mexico than any other US carrier. While the airline's biggest burden is its heavy debt, one of its biggest strengths is its low cost base. This is why Mr Harris said he was committed not to reduce salaries at Continental. 'Our people are the lowest paid in the industry. Morale is high. That is helping us in bankruptcy', he explained. Although Continental, unlike many airlines, does not have a cost problem, it does have a revenue problem. At the end of the day, the success or failure of its recovery strategy will depend on its ability to improve the quality and yields of its revenues.</p>

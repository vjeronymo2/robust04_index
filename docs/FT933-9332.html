			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / International Company News: Procter &amp; Gamble hit by provisions THE costs of the restructuring programme announced by Procter &amp; Gamble last month, and some other large one-off charges, took the Cincinnati-based consumer products group heavily into the red in the 12 months to end-June. P&amp;G said yesterday that it made an after-tax loss of Dollars 656m in its latest financial year. Sales were Dollars 30.4bn, up 3.6 per cent. However, the deficit was due solely to P&amp;G's previously-announced Dollars 1.5bn after-tax reserve, designed to fund the cost-cutting moves announced in mid-July, and a further Dollars 1bn non-cash charge to cover the new accounting standards on retiree medical benefits and deferred taxes. Added to a Dollars 200m restructuring provision, established last September to cover the disposal of P&amp;G's fruit juice business, one-off charges reduced P&amp;G's profits last year by Dollars 2.7bn. Before these charges, P&amp;G said that after-tax earnings wereDollars 2.07bn, 11 per cent up on the Dollars 1.87bn of the previous year. Earnings per share, ahead of charges, stood at Dollars 2.91, also up by 11 per cent. In the fourth quarter, P&amp;G's after-tax profits - before the charges - increased by just 1 per cent, to Dollars 341m, while sales increased by 3 per cent to Dollars 7.36bn. However, Mr Edwin Artzt, chairman, noted that pre-tax operating profits showed a more healthy 9 per cent increase. In the US, underlying unit volume increased by 1 per cent during the year overall, although by 6 per cent in the final quarter. The international businesses saw a 10 per cent increase in unit volume during 1992-3.</p>

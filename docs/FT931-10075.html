			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (26): German giant strengthens position - Once Britain led the world but now mainland companies are dominant. But, the gap between UK insurers and their continental rivals has not increased in real terms / Insurance LARGE mainland European insurance companies continue to dominate an industry in which Britain historically has been a world leader. Seven leading general insurance companies are from Germany (Allianz, Muenchener Ruck), Italy (Generali), Switzerland (Swiss Re and Zurich) and France (Union des Assurances de Paris and Assurances Generales de France). Despite a weakening in its share price over the 15 months to September 30, 1992, Allianz, Europe's biggest insurer and now the seventh biggest company in Europe, dwarfs its competitors. The German company, which has spent the past two years quietly digesting big acquisitions in eastern Germany and the US, is still nearly twice as big in market capitalisation terms as its nearest rival, Generali of Italy, and, strikingly, nearly 50 per cent bigger than the combined capitalisation of Britain's five composite insurance companies (Sun Alliance, Commercial Union, General Accident, Guardian Royal Exchange and Royal Insurance). UK insurers can at least be relieved, however, that the gap between them and their rivals on mainland Europe has not increased in real terms, with currency factors playing a part in the improved ratings of the German companies. Six of the 17 companies which improved their ratings were German  -Muenchener Ruck, AMB, Victoria, Wuerttembergische, Volksfuersorge and Nurnberger. During the year to September 30, 1992, the mark appreciated by more than 15 per cent against the US dollar, greater than the corresponding increases in most other European currencies. Germany's Nurnberger - which entered the rankings for the first time as the 451st biggest company - also strengthened its position with a rights issue. Other companies moving up the rankings included Aegon, the well-managed and highly profitable Dutch company which benefited by a 10 per cent rise in its 1991 profits, rising 64 places to 117. Belgium's Royal Belge climbed 44 places to 233rd. Fortis, formed in 1990 by the merger of Amev of the Netherlands and AG of Belgium, has also risen strongly with its capitalisation increasing to Dollars 4,206.4m from Dollars 2,942.7m, taking it from 167 to 104 in the rankings. Generali (whose capitalisation increased from Dollars 11.87bn to Dollars 13.81bn over the period and rose one place in the rankings to 23rd) also made rights issues over the period, and also benefited from the fact that more of its assets are located in Germany and Austria than rival Italian companies. The original domestic market of the Trieste-based insurer was the Austro-Hungarian empire. Irish Life, Ireland's biggest life insurance company, also came into the rankings for the first time following its privatisation in July 1991. Britain's Britannic rose by 11 places to 396, after reporting improved profitability in 1991 (profits up 38 per cent to Dollars 40.8m) with a performance which reflected the buoyancy - in spite of the recession - of traditional door-to-door sales of life insurance policies in the UK. Scandinavia's four largest companies - Skandia and Trygg Hansa SPP Holding of Sweden and Baltica and Hafnia of Denmark - were the biggest losers. All the companies suffered from a deterioration in trading conditions across Scandinavia, but uncertainty stemming from bungled acquisitions and merger efforts was the most serious factor undermining investor sentiment towards the sector. Skandia, the 206th biggest company in Europe by market capitalisation in 1991, was particularly hard hit. Its share price plummeted during the first half of 1992, after Norway's Uni Storebrand and Denmark's Hafnia borrowed heavily to fund an ambitious - and ultimately disastrous - takeover plan. The group's capitalisation sank from SKr14,586m to SKr3,684m. Uni and Hafnia  -the 498th biggest European company in 1991 - were forced to suspend payments to creditors in August and by the end of the year the break-up of both companies appeared to be on the cards. The capitalisation of Italian, Spanish, French and British companies were all hit by a downturn in market sentiment, following a series of poor results in 1991 and falling returns from investments. Two Italian companies  -Fondiaria and Assitalia (part of the state-owned INA empire) left the FT500 (Fondiaria ranked 214 in 1992), while RAS - down from 244 to 282 - and SAI - down from 304 to 417 - also saw their rankings fall. Alleanza, the life insurer in which Generali has a majority stake, increased its profits to Dollars 120.3m (Dollars 100,1m), but fell 15 places in the rankings to 133. Spain's Mapfre, which entered the FT500 last year, has quickly dropped out with its share prices dragged down amid a sluggish performance by the Spanish market as a whole. France's large state-controlled insurers, which figured in the FT500 for the first time in 1991, fell back. Investor confidence has been adversely affected by the prospect of poorer results in 1992 (the figures shown reflect 1991 performance) as well as the problems of the Paris property market, in which each of the companies is a significant investor. Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) fell 17 places to 69, Assurances Generales de France (AGF) fell 15 places to 110, while Groupe des Assurances Nationales (GAN) slumped 99 places to 162. UK composite insurers, which dropped down the table in 1991, registered further falls in 1992, even though investor confidence in the sector has recovered in the expectation of better results in 1992. The combined pre-tax losses in 1991 of the UK's five leading companies - Sun Alliance, Commercial Union, General Accident, Guardian Royal Exchange and Royal Insurance - amounted to more than Dollars 2bn. CU improved its ranking by 10 places (to 115 from 125), but each of the other companies lost ground, with Royal (down to 303 from 159) worst hit. Legal &amp; General, a life company which also has greater exposure to non-life business, also fell (down to 167 from 137). The UK's biggest listed-life company, Prudential Corporation slipped in the rankings (down to 51 from 48), in spite of increasing its 1991 profits to Dollars 441.2m (Dollars 403.2m). Lloyds Abbey Life - the UK's biggest bank insurance business - saw its capitalisation fall in dollar terms, sinking 24 places as a result to 114th. Finally, Sun Life, which was taken over by Rockleigh Corporation, the investment vehicle jointly owned by Liberty Life of South Africa and UAP of France, lost its London listing and left the FT500.</p>

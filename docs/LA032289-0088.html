			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NFL WINTER MEETINGS;  </P> <P> TOO NOISY CHEERING WILL BRING PENALTIES  </P> <P> If you're planning to see a pro football game next fall, be careful when and  how you cheer, and how long. And how loud.  </P> <P> Noticeably noisy cheering -- at the wrong time -- could bring a penalty of 50  yards or more against the home team.  </P> <P> The owners of the 28 National Football League clubs decided that at the winter  meetings at Palm Desert Tuesday, when they empowered their officiating crews to  penalize teams for overzealous crowds.  </P> <P> Referees were authorized to confiscate timeouts or, if necessary, walk off  penalties against teams whose cheering fans raise the noise level to a pitch  that disrupts the other team's communications.  </P> <P> At the Seattle Kingdome, for instance, visiting quarterbacks have for years  complained that their teammates often couldn't hear the signals in the din.  </P> <P> But until now, the NFL has maintained that anti-rabble legislation was  impossible.  </P> <P> As Tex Schramm of the Dallas Cowboys, chairman of the league's competition  committee, used to say: "You can penalize teams and players -- but not crowds."  </P> <P> Tuesday's legislation -- approved by a 21-7 vote -- was unprecedented.  </P> <P> Said Ram Coach John Robinson: "It isn't a bad precedent to ensure the normal  functioning of a game. The colleges have a rule like this."  </P> <P> The NFL rule provides for an unlimited number of yards penalized. Although  football teams and players can be penalized a maximum of 15 yards for even the  most flagrant foul, a crowd that refuses to quiet down could draw a penalty of  50 or 90 yards or even more.  </P> <P> "Eventually (from the five-yard line in) it would be only half the distance of  the field," Schramm said. "So you could never score a touchdown (on the  penalty)."  </P> <P> Two competition committee spokesmen, Schramm and Miami Coach Don Shula,  outlined a three-step, noisy-stadium procedure:  </P> <P>  -- The referee will first advise the fans and the defensive players that there  will be a penalty unless the clamor abates.  </P> <P> If it doesn't, he will take away one or more timeouts -- assuming the home team  hasn't used them all.  </P> <P>  -- Then he will penalize the home team five yards at a time as long as  necessary.  </P> <P> "Hopefully, one lost timeout, or one penalty, will be enough," Schramm said.  "The timeouts will go first because most coaches would rather take a penalty  than lose a timeout." Shula, representing the coaches, approved of the rule.  </P> <P> "The offenses are so sophisticated now that they can operate with hand signals  in a noisy stadium," he said. "But the problem is that this limits what you can  do."  </P> <P> The NFL conceded that the rule violates the free speech amendment to the U.S.  Constitution.  </P> <P> "There's a slight infringement," Schramm said.  </P> <P> In recent years, however, many sports fans have breached the same precept.  </P> <P> "They have prevented the offensive teams from being able to communicate," Shula  said.  </P> <P> The league's battle against fake injuries took the form of a statement by the  competition committee, unopposed by the convention, recommending fines and  suspensions -- and in serious cases loss of draft choices -- for clubs, coaches  and even physicians.  </P> <P> Two members of the committee, Schramm and Shula, urged the NFL's referees to  assume that in any instance, a stricken player is injured, even if he has taken  two or three previous dives, but to put in motion strong disciplinary measures  if they "sense a pattern" of abuse.  </P> <P> The statement was a response to a widely publicized incident last year when the  Seattle Seahawks were accused of faking injuries six times in one game to foil  the Cincinnati Bengals' no-huddle offense.  </P> <P> That offense is entirely legal, the competition committee ruled, supporting  Commissioner Pete Rozelle's position.  </P> <P> Will a mere statement slow the feigning of injuries?  </P> <P> "I think this will stop it," Schramm said.  </P> <P> The league also modified its rule against roughing the passer, enjoining  rushers from heading for a quarterback's knee when they have a clear path in.  </P> <P> The new language is designed to prevent attacks such as that of Philadelphia's  Andre Waters on the Rams' Jim Everett last year.  </P> <P> Waters said afterward that he got the only part of Everett he could reach. And  to some observers, that's the way it looked.  </P> <P> Among others on the competition committee, Shula, however, disagreed.  </P> <P> "He was obviously going for the knee," Shula said.  </P></p>

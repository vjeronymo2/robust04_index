			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GILLESPIE WILL OPPOSE PLAN TO LIMIT ASSIGNED RISK ELIGIBILITY  </P> <P> Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie said Tuesday she will seek a court  injunction to prevent the insurers who run the California Automobile Assigned  Risk Plan from refusing to sell policies to hundreds of thousands of "good  drivers" who cannot buy through the regular market.  </P> <P> Gillespie, speaking at a San Francisco news conference, also said she intends  to institute after public hearings in June a two-tier assigned risk sales plan  under which drivers from families earning less than $26,000 a year would be  permitted to buy liability coverage required under the state's mandatory  insurance law for $700 a year.  </P> <P> Within an hour of her announcements, the insurers -- who had earlier refused  entreaties from the commissioner to make such a special provision for  low-income groups -- responded that Gillespie has no authority to take either  step and said the assigned risk board will fight her in court.  </P> <P> An aide to Gillespie said papers seeking the injunction will be filed by the  end of the week. A hearing is expected before the May 1 deadline, when insurers  say they will stop selling the assigned risk policies to new applicants who are  "good drivers."  </P> <P> The exchange between Gillespie and the insurers marked the latest in a series  of disputes in which the commissioner has insisted that the industry assume  some social responsibility for keeping insurance prices down for those who can  least afford them, and the insurers have answered that the law requires only  that they keep the assigned risk system solvent.  </P> <P> Under the assigned risk plan, drivers who cannot obtain insurance -- either  because of poor driving records or because insurance is unavailable in their  areas -- are assigned to various insurance companies in proportion to the  business the companies do in the state. "Good drivers" are defined as those  with no more than one traffic violation in the last three years.  </P> <P> Gillespie has refused requests by the insurers for a 112.3% rate increase in  the assigned risk system. The insurers, who say the plan lost $600 million in  1989, have responded with court appeals and a new request for a 160.5% hike.  </P> <P> The insurance commissioner said Tuesday, "California has an insurance emergency  because automobile insurance, especially for low- and moderate-income drivers,  is becoming scarcer due to its high cost. This emergency affects the state's  public welfare, criminal justice system, transportation system and overall  economy."  </P> <P> But Steve Feely, vice chairman of the Assigned Risk Plan and an executive at  the Farmers group of companies, challenged Gillespie's right to do anything  about this. He said that to institute a low-income sales plan, the commissioner  would first have to seek approval from the Legislature.  </P> <P> "There is no way of knowing how many people might be made eligible under (her)  proposal, but we have grave concerns about any proposal which would  substantially increase the number of drivers in the plan who would be paying  inadequate rates," Feely said.  </P> <P> Gillespie, meanwhile, also announced that she will hold hearings later this  spring into alleged "redlining" of minorities and other low-income groups by  insurance companies in violation of Proposition 103, which bars such  discrimination.  </P> <P> The commissioner's announcements were hailed by consumer leaders at her news  conference. "We're encouraged," said Robert Gnaizda of Public Advocates,  "because we believe the assigned risk governors are in violation of the law on  several counts."  </P></p>

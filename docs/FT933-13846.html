			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (9): London's misplaced optimism THE LONDON stock market paid the price in the second quarter for what now looks like over-optimism over both global and national economic prospects in the earlier part of the year. At home, expectations that the effective devaluation of sterling after September 1992 would herald a significant recovery in the UK economy were damped down by a notable absence of improvement in company profits. On the international front, successive cuts in interest rates in Europe merely signalled recessionary pressures. By the end of June, continued dissatisfaction with the progress of the domestic economy had been translated into political drama in the House of Commons, adding a new dimension to the uncertain mood holding the stock market in thrall. The FT-SE 100 index, the stock market's favourite, if somewhat limited, measuring rod, finally retained only a few points of its gain from the end of the previous quarter - a gain which never moved above 1 per cent. There are signs, however, that the Footsie was not an entirely reliable guide to performance in the second quarter. It is heavily weighted in terms of UK companies with markets and profits in Germany and the other European countries which appeared to be moving deeper into recession over the quarter. It also includes many pharmaceutical companies, which have been losers on a global market scale because US investors feared that the Clinton administration would cut healthcare costs savagely. The market's performance looks a little better on some of the broader measuring scales. The FT-A All-Share index, covering the full range of UK stocks, added 1.7 per cent over the three month period. The picture brightens even more if the market is measured in terms of the FT-SE Mid 250 share index, which closed on June 30 some 4 per cent higher than at the end of March. The Mid 250 index, by definition, reaches further down the list of domestic stocks that have continued to respond to such recovery in the UK economy as has so far been registered. At the same time, it avoids some of the international pressures. As the second quarter ended, there were signs that the market was fighting its way into a new, higher trading range, and that its faith in economic recovery was resilient. Much of this faith appeared to be rooted in belief that impending cuts in German rates would open the way for further interest rate reductions in the UK - although precisely why a final one-point cut in base rates should achieve what has not been achieved by so many previous reductions has yet to be made clear. But even if it is regaining its confidence, the London market may still face further uncertainty before economic recovery is established. The reshuffle of John Major's government was highlighted by the appointment of a new chancellor of the exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, who has to make important decisions about government spending and on taxation policies later this year. He may put interest rate decisions aside until then. Having survived the ICI/Zeneca demerger, with all its import for core investment portfolios, the financial markets still have to survive the Pounds 5bn sale of the government's shares in BT, and also a state funding programme of an estimated Pounds 1bn a week for the rest of the year. All these considerations continue to restrain a stock market which, nevertheless, retains its faith in economic recovery in the UK, a nation now identified as a low-inflation, low-cost manufacturer. Such faith will now have to wait for the round of third-quarter trading results from British companies.</p>

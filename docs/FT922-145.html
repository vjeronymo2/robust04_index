			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Buckingham plans to raise Pounds 30m in wake of plunge into losses BUCKINGHAM International, the hotels, tours and nursing homes operator, yesterday announced plans to raise about Pounds 30m in the wake of a plunge into pre-tax losses for the year to November 3 and static losses for the six months to May 3. Mr Nick Jivraj, chief executive, said Buckingham, having breached its banking covenants, had the option of either 'a firesale of the company's non-income producing assets' or a refinancing. The company is to issue for cash Pounds 33m nominal of secured redeemable loan stock 1995 at par and 23.1m convertible deferred shares at 0.14p. Mr Jivraj said that the Pounds 30m net proceeds would: pay off Pounds 19m of bank loans; provide working capital; give the company a three-year breathing space in which to sell the non-income producing assets; and allow the completion of the apartment complex in Portugal. The Gulf war had caught Buckingham with a third of its room stock under development and Mr Jivraj said that the conflict had an immediate and detrimental effect on its hotel operations. Cash dried up and covenants were heavily breached - particularly those relating to interest cover. Jivraj family interests and investment trusts under the management of Robert Fleming will take up all their entitlements in the placing. The family interests will be putting up about Pounds 18m of the Pounds 33m raised and loan stockholders will end up with 73 per cent of the enlarged equity. In the year to November 3, turnover rose 33 per cent to Pounds 49.1m (Pounds 37m), although operating profits fell 12 per cent to Pounds 6.17m (Pounds 7.04m). However a jump in interest to Pounds 4.92m (Pounds 1.14m) and exceptional charges of Pounds 9.47m - write-down of assets of Pounds 8m and loan renegotiation fees of Pounds 1.5m - left pre-tax losses of Pounds 8.21m (profits Pounds 5.9m). Losses per share worked through at 7.01p (earnings 5.4p) and the final dividend is omitted, as the interim had been. The previous year's total was 2.1p. Borrowings had risen by Pounds 24.2m over the year to Pounds 81.2m, giving gearing of 82 per cent. In the six months to May 3 turnover advanced 40 per cent to Pounds 21.9m (Pounds 15.6m) reflecting first-time trading from the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza in Lisbon and two hotels in San Antonio, Texas. Operating profits almost trebled to Pounds 1.28m (Pounds 440,000). However, pre-tax losses crept up to Pounds 2.21m (Pounds 2.15m) after interest charges more than doubled at Pounds 4.01m (Pounds 1.73m). Losses per share were 1.84p (1.78p) and Mr Jivraj said the company would not resume dividend payments until after a substantial disposal.</p>

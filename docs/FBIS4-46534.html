			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Lopatin under rubric </F> "Nongovernmental Report": "A Professional Army Instead of an  Armed People"]    [Text] In May 1994 it was two years from the day the  Russian Armed Forces were formed. All this time the Russian  military headed by P. Grachev have been saying over and over  again that a combat-effective Army is being created from the  Soviet Armed Forces rear which Russia inherited, and that is why  there are so many shortcomings and problems. They say that the  Army is being reduced, but to defend the enormous expanse the  numerical strength of the Armed Forces should be not one percent  of the population as provided by law, but 2.1 million  servicemen. The say that a reduction in officers costs  enormously more than their pay and that the problem of Armed  Forces manpower acquisition is "one of the weakest points of  military organizational development" and consequently it is  necessary to keep the draft until the year 2000, placing all  persons of draft age "under arms." Finally, they say that what  "previously was worked out and implemented over many years" has  been done in the Army in two years. Is this so?  <H8>  Transferring Instead of Scrapping </H8>   According to USSR Ministry of Defense data, after  disintegration of the USSR there were over two million  servicemen on the territory of Russia as of 1 January 1992 out  of a Union Army of three million, including 575,000 officers and  280,000 warrant officers, 80 percent of nuclear weapons, over  60,000 pieces of armored equipment, around 60,000 artillery  tubes, 6,000 combat aircraft and helicopters, over 500 combatant  ships and 70 percent of supplies. On the territory of Russia  there also remained 813 of the main enterprises of the  military-industrial complex, supplying 80 percent of arms and  military equipment to the USSR (the annual output was over 400  aircraft and helicopters, around 500 tanks, over 500 artillery  systems, over 20 combatant ships, around 400 missiles and 25  space vehicles).    In the following two years Russia gradually increased its  military potential by subordinating to itself groups of forces  abroad and troops on the territory of a number of former Union  republics (Georgia, Armenia, Belorussia, Moldavia, Tajikistan,  Kirgizia...). During 1992-1993 270,000 servicemen, 3,100 tanks,  6,000 BMP's and 1,500 aircraft were removed to Russian  Federation territory from the far and near abroad.    In essence there was a gradual transfer of the Union Army  together with the military department from certain hands to  others (initially unified USSR Armed Forces, then combined CIS  Armed Forces, and finally Russian Federation Armed Forces). That  is how it always has been in world practice: with a change in  state leadership, the army has been resubordinated by the  traditional method--the military leadership was bought (or  bribed), concessions were made in the form of partial reforms or  the promise of them for the lower Army strata, and the oath was  administered to military units, with actions by enemies of the  new authority suppressed. That was how it was this time as well.  The exceptional experience of the Bolsheviks, who created the  Red Army through a scrapping of the old one, was not repeated.  Thus, the Russian Armed Forces were formed by changing uniform  and name, with resubordination and maximum preservation of the  Union Army.  <H8>  Preservation Instead of Reduction </H8>   In 1850 it wa believed that one million soldiers were  sufficient to defend all European countries. A half-century  later, in 1900, the numerical strength of standing armies had  been brought to three million. Toward the end of the 20th  century there are 25 million persons under arms in the world  (including around 8 million in Europe, 3 million in the Near  East, around 10 million in Asia, 3.5 million in America and 1  million in Africa).    In Russia the numerical strength of the standing army also  rose: in 1725 there were 210,000 in the regular Army, 28,000 in  the Navy, and 100,000 Cossacks; in 1913 there were 1.35 million,  including over 1,700 generals and 150,000 officers.    After disbanding the Russian Army of 10 million in a few  months in 1917, the Bolsheviks subsequently introduced the  practice of sharp reductions in the Army, which repeatedly led  to social shocks both in the Army as well as in society:     -  1922-1923--Army reduced from 5.5 million to 562,000;    -  1945-1947--8.5 million demobilized (2.8 million remained);    -  1953-1955--1.1 million, including 119,000 officers,  discharged  because of reduction;    -  1956-1958--a reduction of 600,000, including over 100,000  officers.        With the beginning of perestroyka in the USSR, the reduction  in the Army proceeded basically through a decrease in the  authorized strength of servicemen, which greatly exceeded their  actual number:     -  1989-1990--from 4.2 to 3.7 million, including 100,000  officers and 50,000 warrant officers;    -  1991--by 700,000, including 150,000 officers and 90,000  warrant  officers, with a shortage of 660,000 persons in the USSR Armed  Forces.        Thus, in the Soviet period a reduction in the Armed Forces  as  a rule took place in 1-2 years, and at the proposal of the  military department itself, but without a program being  developed to settle servicemen being discharged to the reserve.  This was explained either as a transition from war to peace, or  as a reduction in those who even so already had served the  prescribed terms, or simply as a reduction in "dead souls" from  the shortage of personnel, or as a "reduction" through removal  of troops from the Armed Forces makeup (1989--Railroad Troops,  MVD Internal Security Forces, KGB Border Guard Troops;  1991--Civil Defense troops and road construction units;  1994--according to the plan, "peacemaking forces" and the  Airborne Troops.    In January 1992 B. Yeltsin announced a reduction in the  Armed  Forces of 700,000 persons from their actual number. In September  of that same year the Russian Federation Law "On Defense"  established that by 1 January 1995 "the actual number of Russian  Federation servicemen in the peacetime Russian Federation Armed  Forces cannot exceed one percent of the Russian Federation  population," i.e., in 2.5 years there was to be a reduction of  another half-million in the size of the Army. The military  department committed itself to preparing a program for the Armed  Forces reduction.    But in February 1993 the Russian Federation Minister of  Defense announced, and the Russian Federation President  confirmed then as well, an authorized strength of Russian  Federation Armed Forces of 3.5 million, including 2,218  generals, 692,000 officers, and 2.8 million privates and NCO's,  with an actual numerical strength of 1.8 million servicemen. A  half-year later Grachev announced the authorized strength of the  Armed Forces already as 2.34 million with an actual strength of  around 1.5 million, although, as we know, nowhere did anyone  announce a reduction of 1.2 million in the Army during this  period. The state program for Armed Forces reduction just had  not been prepared, but on the other hand the task of "reducing  the Armed Forces to the prescribed level" according to basic  provisions of military doctrine had been postponed for a year  (until 1996), and the Armed Forces numerical level itself,  established by law, was arbitrarily raised by Grachev from 1.5  to 2.1 million. While he had declared repeatedly in 1993 that  the Army had to be "small and completely professional" and the  numerical strength of the Armed Forces, as specified by the Law  "On Defense", would be brought to 1.5 million, in 1994,  admitting that the Armed Forces were only at 54 percent strength  in privates and NCO's, he nevertheless asserts that we need an  Army of two million, but a reduction in the Armed Forces is  possible in 1994 by 200,000 and in 1995 by another 200,000. For  the umpteenth time he explains his position by the need to  defend the homeland and by the threat of social shocks, although  the task of reducing an Army of 1.5 million by increasing it by  400,000-600,000 persons does not lend itself to understanding.    One might ask why such sly statistics are necessary. They  permit the following:     -  preserve over 150 formations and the entire gigantic  superstructure above them (hence the 7 to 50 percent personnel  strength of units, by which an attempt is made to patch  "Trishka's caftan" of combat readiness [from a Krylov fable,  meaning that fixing one thing results in damaging another]; and  substantiate the need for 2,500 generals and greater  expenditures for Army upkeep;    -  preserve the existing military system, including universal  military obligation, and not hasten with military reform;    -  announce, if necessary, another "peaceful" initiative in  reducing the Armed Forces.        That is how it was under M. Gorbachev, and that is how it is  under Yeltsin. As a result, with an Armed Forces reduction of  2.7 million announced over the last five years, the overall  number of those under arms in Russia's 16 departments remained  practically the same--3.5 million. But even if everyone who  reaches the age of 18 (in Russia this is around one million  persons annually) were to be placed under arms, as Grachev  wishes to do, even then one could not reach the level announced  by our generals in the interests, of course, of "ensuring  Russia's security."  <H8>  What Does History Teach? </H8>   As follows from the unclassified report which the USSR  submitted to the League of Nations in April 1931, the numerical  strength of servicemen in the USSR as of 1 January 1931 was  562,000 in the Armed Forces, including 38,000 command personnel;  28,000 in the Border Guard Troops; and 17,000 in OGPU [United  State Political Directorate] Internal Security Forces.    At that time 1.2 million persons reached draft age annually,  of whom 300,000-350,000 were not physically fit. The principle  of an "armed people" professed by Napoleon and von Moltke, who  even intended to provide the Army as the teacher of their  nations by passing all people through the barracks, required  teaching military affairs to 900,000 persons annually. But with  a two-year term of service it was possible to pass only 270,000  temporary duty personnel through the RKKA [Workers' and  Peasants' Red Army] and other troops. It was necessary either to  increase the Army to 1.7 million or combine a regular army with  a militia system (a regular division passed 1,900 persons  through a year and a territorial division 3,500, with  expenditures for training one fighting man being R535 in 2 years  and R291 in 5 years respectively). With the economic and  political isolation of the USSR, which did not possess nuclear  weapons, the second path was chosen as being most economical and  effective. The situation has changed fundamentally under present  conditions, as follows from Russian Federation military  doctrine. First of all, "the immediate threat of direct  aggression being unleashed against the Russian Federation has  dropped considerably" and Russia "does not regard a single state  as its enemy," considering "as partners all states whose policy  does not harm its interests and does not contradict the UN  Charter." Secondly, traditional Armed Forces have a tertiary  significance as a deterrence factor in ensuring military  security after nonmilitary means and nuclear weapons, first use  of which we rightly rejected. Thirdly, the Russian Federation  ensures its security through entry into or cooperation with  collective security structures. And finally, an overall  reduction of armed forces and military expenditures is occurring  in the world.    The country's economic capacities changed substantially  simultaneously with this:     -  Russia's territory and its population and draft resources  are less than in the USSR by one-third and one-half  respectively;    -  gross domestic product [GDP] for 1992-1993 dropped 30 percent  along with a growth in domestic debt and the budget deficit;    -  over 40 million Russians were below the subsistence minimum  in  1994.        The situation has changed, but we continue to try to fit the  practice of military organizational development to the theory of  "massive war" and an "armed people." Speaking recently in the  State Duma to substantiate increased military expenditures,  Chief of Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff Colonel  General M. Kolesnikov asserted that "armed conflict will require  a mass army four times larger than the present one" and that  today we cannot fight for four years in a row as during World  War II. Having 30 million persons on military registration, of  whom 6 million are the top-priority reserve, we continue to try  to place all youth under arms, sending one-third of draftees to  "other troops" to perform duty--Border Guard Troops (150,000),  Internal Security Forces (around 400,000), and Railroad, Road  Construction and other troops (in 15 departments in all),  including troops under joint-stock companies (such as  Rostelekom, Dalspetsstroy and so on), which altogether  contradicts the Russian Federation Constitution.    The demand is not to increase the number of privates, but to  reduce the number of supervisory personnel with a change in the  table of organization structure by reducing the number of highly  paid general and officer positions and increasing the proportion  of NCO's and civilian personnel. But only 10 of the 115 military  educational institutions on the territory of Russia with an  annual graduation of 37,000 officers have been reduced in two  years. As before, up to 30,000 young officers are graduated each  year with a simultaneous increase in monetary allowance for  cadets to R130,000 per month.    It would appear that neither world experience nor our own  history teaches us anything. In Czarist Russia before World War  I only 26 cadet schools and 38 warrant officer schools were  training commanders for an army of 1.5 million, with an annual  graduation of 3,000 officers and 19,000 warrant officers. In the  summer of 1941 there were 1.3 million officers in a Red Army of  10 million, while by the end of 1941 Germany had only 148,000  officers at all fronts, of whom only 23,000 were regular. In  1941 both Russia and Germany were relying on NCO's--professional  junior commanders. In the world practice of military  organizational development today, the norm for states with a  highly developed economy is a ratio in which 0.05 percent are  generals, 10-15 percent officers, and 35 percent junior  commanders, with an overall numerical strength of servicemen not  exceeding 0.7-0.8 percent of the country's population and with  the proportion of military expenditures at 3-4 percent of GDP.  For Russia this would mean having the numerical strength of the  Armed Forces at one million, including up to 700 generals, up to  200,000 officers and up to 350,000 junior commanders.  <H8>  `Be, Rather Than Appear To Be' </H8>   These parting words left for the German General Staff by A.  von Schlieffen seemingly acquire special pertinence in our  Russian reality.    On the one hand, Russian generals record and the Russian  Federation President approves among basic provisions of military  doctrine such principles of ensuring military security in the  Russian Federation as "conformity of Armed Forces organizational  development to the country's political goals and economic  capacities and to the course of reforms," and "use of domestic  and world experience in military organizational development."    On the other hand, with growing military expenditures, the  practice of military organizational development does not conform  to the country's political goals and economic capacities.  Dissipation of allocated forces and assets to a large number of  formations and units, an absence of interest in service among  officers, massive draft dodging among civilian youth, and  "commercialization" of service all lead to decay of the Army. As  a result there is neither money nor an Army.    This is occurring because, using military reform as a cover  and speculating on problems of servicemen and workers of the  military-industrial complex, state and military bureaucrats  demand increased expenditures not for transformations, but for  preserving the previous system, partially canceling the  dissatisfaction of its representatives through increased pay.  This enables keeping the military-bureaucratic apparatus at the  previous size and permits its uncontrolled use of sources of  incomes in the military department for their personal goals.    Only through military reform is it possible to obtain a  combat-effective army with a real and inevitable reduction of  military expenditures. The goals proclaimed in Russia of  building a democratic, rule-of-law state and civilian society  demand a decisive rejection of the practice of mass education of  society through the Army, general militarization of citizens,  and militarization of their labor. A professional army of one  million on a volunteer basis must come to replace the "armed  people," with introduction of alternative (civilian) service and  with retention of service by conscription only in wartime. Today  every third state in the world has a fully professional army on  a volunteer basis, including the United States, Great Britain,  Canada, Japan, India, Pakistan and Australia.    How can we shift to a professional army with fewest losses  and costs, in the shortest time and with greatest effectiveness?    An optimum solution to this problem requires fulfilling the  following basic conditions:    1. If we immediately recognize the actual numerical strength  of the Armed Forces to be authorized and plan military  expenditures, withdrawal of troops, real reduction and military  reform on this basis.    2. If we cut the number of units and formations in half and  man the rest with the freed-up personnel (1994-1995).    3. If we change the ratio of branches of Armed Forces  through  a significant reduction in the proportion of ground troops and  air defense and shift to Armed Forces organizational development  based on missions (1994-1995).    4. If we reduce military schools (by 40-70 percent for  branches of the Armed Forces) and military academies (leave one  per branch) and bring the annual graduation of officers to  10,000 (1994-199(5)).    5. If we reduce the size of command and control entities  (above all at the expense of the intermediate level) with a  threefold reduction in the number of generals' positions and  with the granting of pensions and of the benefits prescribed by  law (1994).    6. If we reduce the number of officer positions, with the  discharge (at their wish) of those who have served the  prescribed terms, with presentation of an opportunity to fill  previous positions in administrative management entities and  logistic, medical and financial support entities, positions of  technical specialists and positions in military science with  civilian personnel, and with the discharge and settling of the  remaining portion of officers under a reduction (1994-1998).    7. If we reduce the number of positions filled by warrant  officers (by 80-90 percent), with the right granted to fill a  number of previous positions by civilian personnel  (storekeepers, chiefs of depots, storehouses and messhalls, and  so on) and positions of junior commanders, with nonextension of  contract with persons who have not been certified (1994-1996).    8. If we revise the time periods, conditions and curriculum  for training junior commanders based on a number of military  schools being reduced, bringing in servicemen from among cadets  and warrant officers, and increasing the prestige of their  service (1994-1995).    9. If we carry out the reduction and certification of  cadets,  warrant officers, officers and generals for further service  through competitive professional selection, with mandatory  reorganization and professionalization of military cadre  entities and with greater rights granted to servicemen's  assemblies (1994-1996).    10. If we revise the conditions, time periods for going over  to contract service, and content of the contract (not only  obligations of the serviceman, but also responsibility of the  state is necessary), with priority conclusion of contracts (for  2-5 years) with officers and persons certified for positions of  junior commanders and of technical specialists in combat teams  and crews (1994-1995).    Fulfillment of these ten "if's," which define the concept of  transition to a professional Army through a structural reduction  in the Armed Forces, will permit having a professional army in  Russia already in this century.    A professional army is not an end in itself.    Transition to a volunteer method of manpower acquisition and  to contract service permits resolving problems and tasks which  are difficult to resolve under the present system of military  organization:     -  preserve combat effectiveness and increase combat  readiness of the Armed Forces with a reduction in their  numerical strength;    -  perform selection and manpower acquisition based on strict  competition with increased demands on candidates instead of  registration without competition and mass call-up;    -  relieve officers of performing duties of junior commanders  and  privates, and relieve the Army of the function of a "cheap labor  force";    -  ensure high professionalism through an interest in service  and  responsibility of both parties to the contract (both the  civilian and the command element);    -  lower the number of  accidents, breakdowns and crashes and increase the operating  life of equipment, reducing the volume of military orders for  its production;    -  substantially reduce the number of instances of loss and  injury  among personnel, eliminate causes of "dedovshchina" and elevate  the level of military discipline;    -  free up additional working hands for the country's national  economy (by reduction and non-call-up) and also free up real  estate, equipment and property in the Armed Forces, which in  other countries led to an increase in GDP and full compensation  for additional expenditures for transition to a professional  army;    -  ensure stability of the Army in an unstable society, and  prestige of military service amidst strong anti-Army sentiments  among draft-age youth and their parents.        In agreeing with the Russian Federation President's  statement  that "the military department does not reform itself," it is  evidently necessary to examine this matter in the Security  Council, in the Federal Assembly, and in society, creating a  Committee for Assistance to Military Reform in the Russian  Federation based on results of the discussion.</p>

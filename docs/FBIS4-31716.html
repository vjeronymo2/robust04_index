			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, June 14 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Deputy Prime  Minister Zeljko Simic and head of the Croatian Bureau in  Belgrade Zvonimir Markovic agreed on Tuesday it was necessary to  restore communications and economic and other ties between  Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) and Croatia, which they said  would pave the way to resolving vital problems in Serbo-Croatian  relations.    The Yugoslav Information Ministry said in a statement that  Markovic briefed Simic about the Croatian Bureau's activities  and handed him a letter from Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime  minister and foreign minister.    The two sides agreed that Simic's visit to Zagreb on  February  12, was a step towards resuming negotiations aimed at  normalizing mutual relations and stabilizing the overall  political situation in the region. They also said they hoped  that Simic and Granic would meet soon and that outstanding  problems would be resolved on an equal footing and in the spirit  of tolerance which had so far prevailed in the talks between  Yugoslavia and Croatia. Croatia violently seceded from the  former Yugoslav federation in mid-1991.</p>

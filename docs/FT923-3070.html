			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Japan rules out interest rate cut JAPANESE officials yesterday dismissed suggestions that Japan should cut its own interest rates but welcomed the realignment of European currencies and the German decision to reduce rates. Mr Tsutomu Hata, finance minister, said that Japanese interest rates were already low and that there was no reason to cut them further. 'The cumulative effects from the past five discount rate cuts are emerging steadily and (interest) rates are at useful levels,' he said. Mr Mamoru Ozaki, vice- finance minister, said Germany was intending to stem the recent rise in the value of the D-Mark, but added: 'This, however, will not inspire us to alter our monetary policy.' Japanese financial markets nonetheless rallied yesterday, partly on expectation of a further easing of Japanese rates. The Nikkei index of the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed up 363.71 points, at 18,471.40. Traders said the rally was partly a response to the 800 point decline on Friday, but sentiment was aided by the prospect of an international move towards lower interest rates.</p>

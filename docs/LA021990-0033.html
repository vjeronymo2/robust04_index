			<p><P> February 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRS INQUIRY FOCUSES ON FOREIGN FIRMS' U.S. COMPANIES;  </P> <P> TAXES: AUDITS INTO SUSPECTED 'UNDERPAYMENTS' HAVE BEEN IN THE WORKS FOR YEARS.  THE AMOUNT IN QUESTION COULD RUN AS HIGH AS $12 BILLION.  </P> <P> The Internal Revenue Service confirmed Sunday that it has been auditing  American subsidiaries of foreign-owned companies to see whether they have been  underpaying their corporate income taxes.  </P> <P> IRS officials estimated that the cases they now have in progress suggest that  suspected "underpayments" by such firms over the past several years could  amount to as much as $12 billion. However, many of the cases are still in  negotiation and may not yield that much.  </P> <P> The suspicion stems from the fact that although foreign investment here has  tripled during the past decade and foreign firms are now earning substantially  more than they did before, the amount they are paying in U.S. taxes has  remained almost unchanged.  </P> <P> IRS officials confirmed Sunday that data compiled by the agency indicates that  of about 36,800 foreign-owned companies that filed U.S. tax returns in 1986,  more than half reported they had no taxable income.  </P> <P> Although authorities say the cases often are a matter of judgment, there is  suspicion that some foreign-owned subsidiaries in this country have  successfully reduced their tax liability by "overpaying" for the parts or  technology they import, thus cutting back the income they report here.  </P> <P> Charles S. Triplett, deputy associate chief counsel of the IRS, said the  auditing, which was reported Sunday by the New York Times, was begun in the  early 1980s and was intensified during the last half of the decade when foreign  firms' presence in the United States increased.  </P> <P> "We stepped it up four years ago -- it's not exactly a hot flash," he said in a  telephone interview.  </P> <P> Triplett said that contrary to some reports, the probe was not being  concentrated on Japanese companies. But he said it is possible that more  Japanese-owned firms ultimately may be challenged because they tend to import  from parent firms rather than buy their parts here.  </P> <P> "We are not picking on any particular country," Triplett said. "We also have a  lot of Canadian and West German cases, but they don't seem to make the news  flashes."  </P> <P> The disclosure follows a study last year by the congressional Joint Committee  on Taxation that suggested there was "some indication that the level of tax  payments of foreign-owned businesses in the United States is unusually low."  </P> <P> Triplett said the agency's efforts could be bolstered in future audits by a  1989 law that enables the IRS to fine foreign-owned companies up to $10,000 a  month if they do not comply promptly with demands for records or testimony, and  then eventually assess extra taxes. But he said the law does not apply to  records for tax years before it was enacted and so is of little help in the  audits that the IRS currently is performing, which primarily involve the  behavior of corporations during the early 1980s.  </P> <P> IRS officials said the new law was enacted to reinforce a 1987 ruling by a  federal district court in Los Angeles that empowered IRS officials to subpoena  the records of a U.S. subsidiary of a foreign firm. That case involved Toyota,  U.S.A., the auto importer.  </P> <P> Triplett said the IRS frequently finds a reverse pattern when U.S. subsidiaries  move to foreign tax havens. In those cases, he said, they sometimes allocate  too much of their incomes to their foreign operations, thus reducing the amount  they must pay to Uncle Sam.  </P> <P> Triplett cautioned, however, that in many such instances the allocation of  income between one country and another is a matter of judgment and eventually  is determined by negotiation between the IRS and the corporation involved.  </P> <P> "They're not out of compliance necessarily," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of the Czech Republic (3): Reserves grow Relatively high interest rates and the prospect of Koruna revaluation in the event of full convertibility keep foreign funds flowing in. Every day for the past few months, the CNB has been buying foreign currency at the regular 11am forex fixing session, writes Anthony Robinson. So far this year, it has drained Dollars 3.4bn of liquidity from the markets, pushing reserves up to Dollars 5.8bn by early December. This is after repayment ahead of schedule of International Monetary Fund loans totalling Dollars 1.07bn. Reserves in the banking system as a whole, at about Dollars 8.3bn, are roughly equivalent to a quarter of the estimated Dollars 35bn gross domestic product for 1994. This means that at the end of its second year of independence, the Czech Republic is essentially free of foreign debt. Psychologically, that is gratifying, especially after the initial worry prompting the central bank to borrow abroad to bolster reserves shortly after the January 1993 divorce from Slovakia. But the inflows, much of which are speculative, have disturbing implications for money supply and inflation control. The CNB is struggling to keep inflation for 1994 within its target of 10 per cent. Mr Josef Tosovsky, governor of the CNB, warns: 'It will be much harder to reduce inflation to 8 per cent in 1995 against a background of rising economic growth.'</p>

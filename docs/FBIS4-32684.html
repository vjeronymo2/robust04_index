			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by N. Ilic: "Claws of the Turkish Beys"] </F>   [Text] Over the last 10 years and especially since the  disintegration of the SFRY [Socialist Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia], southeast Serbia has lived in a tense and  unpleasant shadow of the frantic Islamization of the neighboring  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM]. This is an  assessment that can be heard ever more frequently in this region  and also in the reports of the leading international agencies.    In the last three years Turkey has been acting more and more  aggressively toward Macedonia, taking advantage of its poor  economic position and the blockade from the south. The aim is  to conquer the territories in the south Balkans that the Ottoman  Empire lost some 70 years ago, correspondents of REUTER and the  French papers write from Skopje.    According to these papers, the finale of the Turkish plan is  to build a railroad to Albania through Macedonia, which would  close the "green" circle around Serbia and open the possibility  of a military-transport route toward Kosovo, Raska, and  Montenegro.    It is also rumored that businessmen from Ankara and Istanbul  are offering $200 million in nonrepayable investments to the  FYROM Government to see "the Islam Express" roaring down the  Macedonian railroad tracks in six months' time. All this  envisages Skopje's meek consent to the realization of this  project because this former Yugoslav republic is, due to the big  credits it took from Turkey during the time of gaining its  independence, financially and politically incapable of resisting  this demand.    The national parties in FYROM admit that the Turkish beys  have with this bought the tacit approval of the Macedonian  officials, whom they have grasped in their claws for a long  time. They have even managed to secure a 24-hour Turkish  language television program in the middle of Macedonia as well  as renovation and revival of the Turkish schools in Western  Macedonia, where the majority of children do not speak the  language of sultans at all.    By 2005 the Muslim population is expected to form the  majority population in Macedonia. There are more pupils of the  Islamic denomination in the first grades of primary schools than  of other denomination now, the statisticians and those well  acquainted with the situation in FYROM claim.    Behind all this, naturally, lies a question: Will Turkey,  with a demographic explosion of the Islamic population via our  southern neighbor, try to recapture what it lost in the Balkan  wars and will it, with the railroad, by the end of the year be  knocking on the doors of southeast Serbia, too?    "It is realistic to expect something of the kind. For the  Turks have never overcome their loss of the Balkans. They have  left sizable traces here and we can thus expect first the  attacks of their propaganda and then of the remaining state  'machinery,' concretely in Toplica and the region around Vranje,  Pirot, Leskovac, and Nis, where numerous geographical localities  are still registered under their [Turkish] names," Prokuplje  historian Bozidar Cevori says.    According to him, history knows of cases of rapprochement of  the Turks, the Albanians, the Sandzaklians [the residents of  Sandzak], and the Turkicized Montenegrins with the aim of  Islamizing the southeast and other parts of Serbia. Here, the  construction of the railroad through Macedonia could give fresh  impetus to the realization of Allah's ideas. The pretensions of  the Turkish beys and landowners should evidently not be taken  lightly as [Bosnia- Herzegovina President] Alija Izetbegovic  himself has announced that this is part of the long-term plan of  the resettlement of approximately 4 million Muslims from Turkey  in the homes of their grandfathers and great-grandfathers.</p>

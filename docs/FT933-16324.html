			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Smith heads for confrontation over unions' block vote MR JOHN SMITH has set himself on a collision course with the trade unions at this autumn's Labour conference by refusing to moderate plans to reduce their collective role in the party's decision-making. In an interview with the Financial Times, the Labour leader underlined his determination to ensure that union participation in the selection of the party's parliamentary candidates could be exercised only through the individual party membership of trade unionists. This one-member, one-vote principle has already been rejected by a majority of trade unions. The TGWU, the largest union affiliated to the party, will this week join others in insisting that, as Labour's paymasters, they must retain a collective voice in the choice of candidates. But Mr Smith said: 'I did not become leader of the Labour party just to do easy things. I have the responsibility as leader to do what I think is right. And I will do it. It's my job to seek to persuade people.' He added: 'I am under no illusions that it's an easy battle to win but I am determined to win it.' Despite the threat of a humiliating defeat at the party conference, where the unions hold 70 per cent of the votes, Mr Smith insisted a decision could not be deferred for a further year: 'I will fight on . . . I hope I will succeed in persuading people to adopt it at the conference.' Mr Smith rejected a compromise floated by some unions which would give votes only to those trade unionists who paid the political levy to their unions and were willing to sign a register of Labour supporters. Instead he wants individual trade unionists to join the party. 'We have got to have people who choose to be members of the party,' he said. He agreed this would mean that they would have to pay another fee in addition to the political levy (an average of Pounds 1.70 per person). The incentives for trade unionists to join the party directly would include a significant cut in the Pounds 18 annual party membership fee. Stressing the need for greater democracy, he added: 'It is not just one-member one vote. It is a lot more members and a lot more votes.' Mr Smith predicted his plan would have strong support from the constituency delegations at the conference. But with those delegations accounting for only 30 per cent of the vote, he is relying on a last-minute retreat by the unions, and on inter-union divisions, to avoid a damaging defeat. Mr Smith was keeping open the possibility of a compromise in his separate dispute with the unions over their role in the election of the party leader. He was ready to consider the possibility that the unions' representation in the electoral college, which chooses the leader, could be calculated on the basis of the unions' proposed register of Labour supporters. David Goodhart writes: Mr Bill Morris, leader of the TGWU party, yesterday strongly reaffirmed the union's hostility to Mr Smith's reforms. He said there was 'absolutely no need' to change the current constitutional relationship and the debate was just a 'distraction'. But he suggested a new argument for delaying the decision for one year if Boundaries Commission changes enable parliamentary selections to be deferred. The union is unlikely to regard Mr Smith's clarification of his position on electing the party leader as an important concession. One official said last night: 'We care much more about the selection of candidates, we have always been involved in that.' By-election pressure, Page 7 John Smith interview, Page 13</p>

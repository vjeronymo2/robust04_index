			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOCAL GAS WILL CURTAIL SUPPLY TO UTILITIES  </P> <P> Southern California Gas Co. will cut natural gas deliveries by more than  two-thirds to electrical utilities starting Nov. 1 to save enough gas to cover  demand from homes and small businesses during cold-weather months, gas company  officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The gas company will cut deliveries to Southern California Edison Co., the  Department of Water and Power, the Imperial Irrigation District and the cities  of Pasadena, Burbank and Glendale, said gas company spokesman Ralph A. Cohen.  </P> <P> "With very high continuing demand from the utility electrical generation  customers, we just can't meet our storage goal of 67.5 billion cubic feet by  Dec. 1," Cohen said.  </P> <P> The curtailment of cleaner-burning gas -- only the most recent of several over  the past two years -- could force the electrical utilities to burn dirtier oil  to generate power.  </P> <P> But Edison, the gas company's largest customer, has saved 4.8 billion cubic  feet of natural gas under a new storage program and could use it in part to  offset the curtailment, said Edison spokesman Lewis M. Phelps.  </P> <P> Edison officials were to meet with gas company officials on Friday to decide  how to meet the shortfall, Phelps said.  </P> <P> He added that the gas company had promised 100% delivery of natural gas during  smog episode days in November.  </P></p>

			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Stock Exchange calls for curb on manipulation SIR ANDREW Hugh Smith, chairman of the London Stock Exchange, has called for the creation of a single enforcement agency with the power to bring criminal and civil charges in cases of market manipulation. In the exchange's report for the year to March 31 Sir Andrew said that amid growing public concern about market manipulation 'it is not widely recognised how limited are the exchange's powers nor how much valuable work we do to monitor and detect irregularities'. The exchange has called for the creation of a surveillance mechanism which would allow regulators to track all equity-related transactions, including those in underlying derivative instruments which are now not captured by enforcement authorities. Separately, Sir Andrew said the exchange intended to spend about Pounds 40m in the next two-and-a-half years to build a successor to the outdated SEAQ price display system. The exchange has already spent about Pounds 7.5m planning SEAQ, which had been the subject of opposition from some members. It had been said that the exchange's inability to make its Taurus paperless settlement system work raised questions about its ability to build a cost-effective SEAQ successor. Sir Andrew said IBM Consulting had been retained to act as a monitor of progress on the project in an effort to avoid the Taurus pitfalls. The annual report noted that the exchange suffered a pre-tax loss of Pounds 11.9m for the year which ended in March, against a profit of Pounds 1.5m the year before, as it absorbed the costs of closing down Taurus. During the year the exchange conducted more than 295 investigations into possible breaches of trading and reporting rules and 10 cases were referred to disciplinary panels. The report confirmed that Mr Peter Rawlins, who resigned in March as Stock Exchange chief executive after the failure of the Taurus project, was paid Pounds 348,530 in the year to March 31 (Pounds 272,584 in the previous year). He also received Pounds 174,500 compensation for loss of office, including a car worth Pounds 9,500.</p>

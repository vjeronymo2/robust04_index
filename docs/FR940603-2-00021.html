			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;The 603 Basin at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) contains deteriorating irradiated reactor fuel from a number of sources. This basin also contains sludge from corrosion of the reactor fuel. The seismic competence of the 603 Basin is not established. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Processing canyons and reactor basins at the Savannah River Site contain large amounts of deteriorating irradiated reactor fuel stored under conditions similar to those at the 603 Basin at INEL. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;There are thousands of containers of plutonium-bearing liquids and solids at the Rocky Flats Plant, the Hanford Site, the Savannah River Site, and the Los Alamos National Laboratory. These materials were in the nuclear-weapons-manufacturing pipeline when manufacturing ended. Large quantities of plutonium solutions are stored in deteriorating tanks, piping, and plastic bottles. Thousands of containers at the Rocky Flats Plant hold miscellaneous plutonium-bearing materials classed as ``residuals'', some of which are chemically unstable. Many of the containers of plutonium metal also contain plastic and, in some at the Rocky Flats Plant, the plastic is believed to be in intimate contact with the plutonium. It is well known that plutonium in contact with plastic can cause formation of hydrogen gas and pyrophoric plutonium compounds leading to a high probability of plutonium fires. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We note that removal of fissile materials from the 603 Basin at INEL has begun. We are also following the plans for remedying several of the other situations listed. In general these plans are at an early stage. In addition, we are aware of steps DOE has taken to assess spent fuel inventories and vulnerabilities. We also note that a number of environmental assessments are being conducted in relation to the situations we have listed above. Finally, we note that a draft DOE Standard has been prepared for methods to be used in safe storage of plutonium metal and plutonium oxide. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These actions notwithstanding, the Board is concerned about the slow pace of remediation. The Board believes that additional delays in stabilizing these materials will be accompanied by further deterioration of safety and unnecessary increased risks to workers and the public. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore the Board recommends: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) That an integrated program plan be formulated on a high priority basis, to convert within two to three years the materials addressed in the specific recommendations below, to forms or conditions suitable for safe interim storage. This plan should recognize that remediation will require a systems engineering approach, involving integration of facilities and capabilities at a number of sites, and will require attention to limiting worker exposure and minimizing generation of additional waste and emission of effluents to the environment. The plan should include a provision that, within a reasonable period of time (such as eight years), all storage of plutonium metal and oxide should be in conformance with the draft DOE Standard on storage of plutonium now being made final. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) That a research program be established to fill any gaps in the information base needed for choosing among the alternate processes to be used in safe conversion of various types of fissile materials to optimal forms for safe interim storage and the longer term disposition. Development this research program should be addressed in the program plan called for by (1) above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) That preparations be expedited to process the dissolved plutonium and trans-plutonium isotopes in tanks in the F-Canyon at the Savannah River Site into forms safer for interim storage. The Board considers this problem to be especially urgent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) That preparations be expedited to repackage the plutonium metal that is in contact with, or in proximity to, plastic and to eliminate the associated existing hazard in any other way that is feasible and reliable. Storage of plutonium materials generated through this remediation process should be such that containers need not be opened again for additional treatment for a reasonably long time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) That preparations be expedited to process the containers of possibly unstable residues at the Rocky Flats Plant and to convert constituent plutonium to a form suitable for safe interim storage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) That preparations be expedited to process the deteriorating irradiated reactor fuel stored in basins at the Savannah River Site into a form suitable for safe interim storage until an option for ultimate disposition is selected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) That the program be accelerated to place the deteriorating reactor fuel in the K-East Basin at the Hanford Site in a stable configuration for interim storage until an option for ultimate disposition is chosen. This program needs to be directed toward storage methods that will minimize further deterioration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) That those facilities that may be needed for future handling and treatment of the materials in question be maintained in a usable state. Candidate facilities include, among others, the F- and H-Canyon and the FB- and HB-Lines at the Savannah River Site, some plutonium-handling glove box lines among those at the Rocky Flats Plant, the Los Alamos National Laboratory, and the Hanford Site, and certain facilities necessary to support a uranium handling capability at the Y&hyph;12 Plant at the Oak Ridge Site. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) Expedited preparations to accomplish actions in items (3) through (7) above should take into account the need to meet the requirements for operational readiness in accordance with DOE Order 5480.31. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> John T.

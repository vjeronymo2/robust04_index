			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (32): Is it really the Wall Street of shame? - Raymond Snoddy on a racy, pacy - and possibly preposterous - history of the Journal / Media THE POWER AND THE MONEY: INSIDE THE WALL STREET JOURNAL by Francis X. Dealy, Jr Birch Lane Press Dollars 22.50 374 pages THE Wall Street Journal could hardly be more respectable or respected throughout the world of business - at least, that part of it influenced in any way by the US. Its staid columns, enlivened only by the occasional line drawing, are almost eccentric in the degree to which they ignore the conventions of modern newspaper design and presentation. Yet according to Francis Dealy's account of the Journal and the people who produce it, appearances are deceptive. His case is not only that the paper's parent Dow Jones has demonstrated business incompetence on a considerable scale, or that the Journal 'missed' some of the biggest stories of the 1980s such as the savings and loan or the Michael Milken scandals, but that there has been behaviour at a senior level verging on the corrupt. Favourable stories could be planted, it is alleged, or the unfavourable played down by taking to lunch a senior figure with a taste for social climbing. Then there is at least one serious case of nepotism at a senior editorial level, the suggestion that promotion owed more to living in the same neighbourhood as senior executives and even the implication that one senior Journal editorial figure slept with a head of state to get a prize-winning interview. For a book that goes on to produce such lurid allegations the narrative begins conventionally enough with a good account of the early years of the paper and its purchase at the turn of the century by the legendary Clarence Barron for Dollars 156,000, including the Dow Jones Ticker Service. Barron was a formidable business journalist whose Seven Points to Better Reporting and Writing could still enlighten contemporary journalism students. For example: '7. The lead is everything. Rework it thirty times. And invariably on the thirty-first try, a perfect paragraph flows from somewhere.' The book is also interesting on the thinking behind the launch of the Asian Wall Street Journal, the role of the Journal in American business life and the perennial debate in any financial publication about where the balance should lie between specialist and more general news - how many 'frisky furniture' stories, as the more mundane business stories are called in-house, should be carried. Inevitably, however, this book will be judged on the accuracy of the more extreme allegations made. Is the Wall Street Journal really such a seething mass of monstrous egos, alternatively missing major stories and cutting ethical corners? A number of those who know the paper well have dismissed the allegations as 'bunk', and although Dealy did work at the Journal it was as an advertising salesman. The habit of reconstructing events through the proliferation of extraneous detail as if there was someone standing by with a video camera does not exactly instill confidence. ('It was Monday, May 23, 1954 at 7.43am and Eddie Schamp, Bill Kerby's chauffeur, had the motor idling as the Dow Jones limousine waited outside 11 Columbia Terrace . . . ') The Power and the Money is not a book to indulge in innocent explanations where a decent conspiracy will do or give up the chance of portraying events in an unfortunate light for the Journal. For example, Dealy refers to New York Times coverage on a Saturday of a case involving a possible tobacco industry research fraud and is disparaging about the fact that the Journal carried the tobacco industry response in its Monday columns, something that simply could have been caused by trying to find a fresh angle on an 'old' story. However, the author quotes an unnamed Journal reporter as saying: 'I don't know for sure, but it is not unreasonable to assume we downplayed the story not to offend an advertiser.' While this is undoubtedly a racy read for anyone interested in newspapers and how they cover business I am left with the nagging feeling that it is not unreasonable to wonder how much of this book I should believe. At least one important conclusion rings true - that the Wall Street Journal has already reinvented itself a number of times, the last in the 1940s, and that the process should not be over. 'For the Journal to continue into the twenty-first century it needs to be transformed again. Yet like Cassandra's prophecy, the prognosis goes unheeded,' Dealy argues. Maybe this time the transformation could include a redesign.</p>

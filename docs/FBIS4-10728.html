			<p>BFN     [Text] Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma has decided to  again convene the Junta of Commanders in Chief in order to  expedite government and Armed Forces contacts. The first  meeting was scheduled for today.    The meeting between the defense minister and General Augusto  Pinochet, Admiral Jorge Martinez Busch, and Air Force General  Ramon Vega lasted two hours.    With this invitation to the commanders in chief, Defense  Minister Edmundo Perez reactivated an institution that had not  met since Chile returned to democracy: the Junta of Commanders  in Chief. The Junta is a Defense Ministry advisory organ  created in 1960. It is by definition the highest military  contact with the political power, although it was never convened  during President Patricio Aylwin's administration.    Minister Edmundo Perez decided to reactivate the organ  because he thinks it is a mechanism that permits an easy  civilian-military contact. The Junta only deals with strategic  and defense affairs. During this meeting, the commanders and the  defense minister analyzed the country's strategic situation.    There were no comments at the end of the meeting, but all  the  participants looked pleased.</p>

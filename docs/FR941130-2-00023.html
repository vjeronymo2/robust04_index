Box 1188, Houston, Texas 77251&hyph;1188, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;211&hyph;001 a request for modification of a Commission order. Transwestern filed the request for modification pursuant to Rule 212 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 CFR 385.212.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transwestern, ``due to changed circumstances'', proposes to modify the sale which was granted by the Commission in its Order Authorizing Abandonment, issued November 1, 1994 in Docket No. CP94&hyph;211&hyph;000, 69 FERC 61,130 (1994). That November 1, 1994, order approved Transwestern's abandonment of the Vaca Lateral by sale to Enron Oil and Gas Company (Enron). Transwestern now proposes to modify the transaction as a spindown whereby the Vaca Lateral will be transferred to Transwestern Gathering Company (TGC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Transwestern. Upon conveyance of the Vaca Lateral facilities to TGC, TGC will in turn reconvey such facilities to Enron, the original transferee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  December 12, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

This abandonment and replacement is necessary for safety since the current tap is located adjacent to a heavily traveled highway. The gas will continue to be metered and transferred to Sevier upstream of the proposed tap.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> East Tennessee proposes to abandon all pipe and the current S.V.3302A&hyph;111 downstream of the new valve by removal. Sevier's current FT&hyph;A contract will reflect the relocation of this tap. There will be no maximum daily quantity increase with the tap's construction and peak day and annual deliveries will not be affected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> East Tennessee will own, operate and maintain the proposed facility. The estimated cost for current facilities abandonment is $8,700, new facilities construction is $16,000, and the total project cost is fully reimbursable to East Tennessee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total quantities to be delivered to Sevier after abandonment and replacement of the facilities will not exceed that authorized to be delivered. East Tennessee has sufficient capacity to accomplish deliveries under the proposed change without detriment or disadvantage to other customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  January 5, 1995, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "African News" program] </F>   [Text] The United Nations special representative in Angola,  Alioune Blondin Beye, is in the capital, Luanda, for talks with  President Jose Eduardo dos Santos after visiting the UNITA  [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] stronghold  of Huambo yesterday. Speaking on arrival, Mr. Beye said there  was no deadlock at the peace talks he has been chairing in  Zambia for the past seven months. He declined to discuss the  possibility that the UN might withdraw from Angola at the end of  the month if no settlement was reached. The government and  UNITA delegations at the talks have returned to consult with  their leaders in Angola. A government minister, Albino Malungo,  has appealed to UNITA to allow the resumption of aid flights,  which were suspended last Monday [13 June], saying food stores  could otherwise deteriorate.</p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Work harder is only option in US and Europe Sir, Thank you for providing excellent information on business in Europe. Problems of unemployment and potential growth are clearly very challenging. I have just finished an assignment in a textile operation in Europe. Some key data are: Total wage costs per hour: (Europe) Dollars 21.25, (US) Dollars 10.25, (Mexico) Dollars 2. Benefits as percentage of total wage: 44, 22, 40. Percentage absent from job: 10-20, 2-4, 1-3. Approximate employee hours worked per year: 1,490, 1,860, 1,940. Plant operating hours per year: 5,150, 8,400, 6,000. North American and European personnel at all levels are going to have to go back to work - fewer holidays, and benefits with more flexibility. There are not enough technology jobs with high pay to provide employment for everyone who wants such a job. New plant, property and equipment is so expensive that plants must have the capability of operating 168 hours per week for 52 weeks per year with little overtime. No business can forecast customer demand with sufficient accuracy, so personnel and other resources must be shifted about for best operations. High-cost nations, including the US, must change. Otherwise, growth and employment will be shifted to low-cost countries. Frank C Wilson, president, International Management, PO Box 1213, Gainesville, Georgia 30503-1213, US</p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Slovak premier personifies his republic's image problems: Anthony Robinson, recently in Bratislava, reports on a new state's old-style chief THE Slovak nationalists who took their country into separate statehood on January 1 argued, above all, that sovereignty would raise the profile of Slovakia in the outside world. Hastily trained ambassadors were sent out to new embassies, the new state gained recognition from governments, the United Nations and a raft of other international institutions, including, last month, the Council of Europe. But there are legitimate doubts whether expensive international exposure has done Slovakia much good. It has served to give a broader platform for Mr Vladimir Meciar, prime minister, who led his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) to victory in the polls a year ago and then to independence from the Czech Republic. Mr Meciar, whose unpredictable and contradictory domestic pronouncements frequently offend ethnic minorities at home, insists on representing Slovakia abroad on all possible occasions, having sacked his first foreign minister, a popular former actor called Milan Knazko, four months ago. But his lack of experience in foreign affairs, his resemblance to the old lumbering Communist-era apparatchik, and lack of foreign languages reinforce precisely the stereotypes of Slovak backwardness which the post-Communist nationalist revival was meant to dispel. Slovakia's entry into the Council of Europe, for example, was marred by Hungarian protests about alleged discrimination against its 600,000-strong ethnic minority in Slovakia. Only at the last moment did Budapest - which had already taken another dispute over the controversial Gabcikovo dam on the river Danube to international arbitration at The Hague - decide to abstain and allow the Slovak application to proceed. Shortly afterwards the Slovak parliament approved a liberal language law which removed many of the Hungarian minority's complaints. But then, Mr Meciar objected and demanded a revision of sensitive clauses, such as that which dropped a requirement for ethnic Hungarian women to add the Slovak ending to their names, turning a typical Hungarian name like Nagy into Nagyova. His decision to re-open a barely healed wound was characteristic. In July he came back from a 10-nation regional co-operation summit in Budapest only to announce that he had decided to acquire five supersonic MiG-29 jet fighters from Russia. The aircraft and spares worth Dollars 180m (Pounds 120.8m) would be acquired in part payment of Moscow's Soviet-era debt to Slovakia, he said, mirroring an earlier Russian-Hungarian agreement under which Budapest will take delivery of MiG-29 and other sophisticated military equipment worth more than Dollars 800m. Hungary justified its own acquisition by the conflict in neighbouring former Yugoslavia. Its armed forces were kept deliberately weak by Moscow after the Hungarian army joined anti-Communist rebels fighting Soviet forces in 1956. But the risks were revealed last year when Yugoslav air force MiG-29s several times violated Hungarian air space during raids on Croatian targets in bordering Slavonia Mr Meciar, however, chose to interpret the Hungarian move as confirmation of Budapest's ambition to reintegrate Transylvania and southern Slovakia, with their 3m strong ethnic Hungarian minorities, into a modern version of the 'greater Hungary' which was dismembered by the 1920 Trianon treaty. But it remains to be seen whether Mr Meciar will be able to complete the deal. Most of the military airports in former Czechoslovakia were sited in the Czech Republic, closer to opposing Nato forces. The military clauses of the complex inter-state divorce agreements divided the military assets of the former federal state in ratio of 2: 1, reflecting the population split of just over 10m Czechs and 5m Slovaks. Slovakia now has far more aircraft than it can service or fly as a result. Much of the equipment transported east is inadequately stored. Acquiring even more military equipment would require substantial collateral spending on training and maintenance beyond the means of the over-stretched Slovak budget. For, economically, Slovakia is in deep trouble. On July 9, Mr Julius Toth, finance minister, announced a 10 per cent devaluation of the Slovak koruna, This was six months after sending an IMF mission packing for proposing a 20-30 per cent devaluation which he attacked as being based on biased figures produced by Prague. To protect the economy, he argued instead for a 20 per cent import surcharge. This has not been applied, but economists and potential investors believe the koruna is still over-valued. Two-way trade with the Czech Republic has fallen by more 30 per cent since January and foreign investors have remained on the sidelines. Slovakia received less than 10 per cent of foreign investment into the former federal republic. It has become less attractive now that access to the Czech market requires extensive paperwork and delays at the new border. Foreign consultants report only desultory interest from the odd potential investor: 'Kicking the tyres' of the new republic, in the words of one US consultant. Most deals are small and involve neighbouring Austrian or northern Italian companies looking for cheap components. 'The Slovaks are good engineers and good metal fabricators, but hopeless at sales and marketing,' one Italian businessman commented. European Community restrictions on steel imports have hit some of the republic's most efficient enterprises, like the East Slovakian Steel Works at Kosice in the east of the country. Slovakia's post-independence economic malaise has been accentuated by a Communist-era bureaucracy, lack of progress in privatisation and a wave of government resignations, including that of Mr Lubomir Dolgos, the privatisation minister. The haemorrhage of frustrated ministers has left Mr Meciar isolated at the head of a minority government and searching for an alliance with the small Slovak National party. Meanwhile, higher taxes have been unable to fill the gap left by the collapse in profitability of the big arms and other state enterprises. Loath to reduce the bureaucracy, and committed to expensive prestige projects like new theatres and the restoration of cultural monuments, the government is being forced to cut pensions and social spending to try to keep the budget within IMF-agreed limits. Devaluation has cleared the way for a Dollars 90m 'systemic transition facility' loan from the IMF with less conditionality than required on a regular standby facility. But the government will be hard pressed to keep the public sector deficit to Kcs15bn (Pounds 300m) given that the deficit reached Kcs14bn by mid-July.</p>

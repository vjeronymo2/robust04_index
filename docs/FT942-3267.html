			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: Upstart Cott shakes up cola kings - The Toronto group is at war with Coke and Pepsi Walk into the Loblaws supermarket in Humbertown Plaza on the western outskirts of Toronto and you are on the frontline of the global cola war. Soft drink displays dominate two walls of the store, and it is quickly apparent which brand Loblaws wants shoppers to buy. Most of the shelf space is taken up by President's Choice (PC), Loblaws' own in-house brand. A 750ml bottle of PC Cola sells for 49 cents, compared with 79 cents for Coca-Cola or Pepsi. While a 24-can case of the two traditional brands costs CDollars 6.99, President's Choice sells for just CDollars 4.99. PC Cola is one of a growing array of private-label soft drinks made by Cott Corporation, the upstart Toronto-based company which is giving Coke and Pepsi - long viewed as two of the world's most invincible brands - their stiffest competition for a long time. The success of Cott and other private-label soft-drink makers led PepsiCo to warn last week that its second-quarter earnings would be virtually flat. Pepsi's share price has tumbled by 16 per cent on the New York Stock Exchange in the past 10 days. By contrast, Cott last week reported a 67 per cent jump in first-quarter earnings, to CDollars 9.6m (USDollars 6.9m). Sales, at CDollars 217.5m, were more than 66 per cent higher, and they included a 77 per cent surge in revenues from the US. Analysts predict sales will surpass CDollars 1.2bn in the year to January 1995, almost double last year's CDollars 665m. Cott has signed supply agreements with 90 retail chains around the world. They include Wal-Mart, the biggest US retailer, which markets Cott products under the name Sam's American Choice. Since the beginning of the year, the Canadian company has helped supermarkets in the UK, France and Spain to launch private-label soft drinks. It recently began shipments to Ito Yokado, Japan's second-biggest retailer. Cott's success is dramatically illustrated by the experience of J. Sainsbury of the UK, which launched a Cott product under the name Sainsbury's Classic Cola in April. Within four weeks, the cola had won a 60 per cent share of Sainsbury sales, equal to a quarter of England's entire take-home cola market. Cott has several advantages over Coke and Pepsi: Its marketing and advertising expenses pale in comparison. By providing retailers with their own private-label brands, Cott has no need to spend tens of millions of dollars promoting a national brand by sponsoring the US National Football League (as Coke does), or hiring Michael Jackson and basketball star Shaqille O'Neal for advertising campaigns (as Pepsi has). Cott piggy-backs on retailers' centralised warehouse and distribution facilities. The same supermarket trucks which carry produce from warehouses to stores bring Cott soft drinks from the bottler back to the warehouse. Until recently, the cost to bottlers of Cott concentrate was as little as one-sixth of that for Coke or Pepsi. Mr Mark Husson, analyst at J. P. Morgan in New York, concluded in a recent report that 'private-brand retailers stand to make 15 per cent more profit from a premium private-brand cola than they do from national brands'. Nowhere has Cott scored bigger gains, or provoked a more powerful response from Coke and Pepsi, than in its home market of Ontario. 'It's tweaked Coke and Pepsi to re-examine their whole organisation,' says the soft drinks category manager at one of Canada's biggest supermarket chains. The products of Cott, disguised in retail chains' private-label packaging, are on the shelves of almost every supermarket in the province. Even corner stores carry them under the name RC Cola (short for Royal Crown Cola), for which Cott has the Canadian bottling licence. Private-label colas have captured more than half the business in the two biggest supermarket groups, Loblaws and Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific (A&amp;P). According to Cott, its products now command a 31 per cent share of the entire Ontario cola market. On the other hand, Coca-Cola's Canadian bottling subsidiary ran up losses of almost CDollars 200m in 1992 and 1993. In a drive to improve competitiveness, it has closed eight of its 16 production plants, and all but six of the 68 administration offices. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have responded to Cott's challenge in Canada by lowering prices and, more importantly, widening retailers' margins. The two national brands used to be loss leaders for many supermarkets. Now, according to an A&amp;P official, the margins on Coke, Pepsi and Cott colas are roughly equal. Competitive margins are not enough, however, to persuade retailers to push Coke and Pepsi as hard as their private labels. According to Mr Husson: 'Successful retailers in the 1990s will be those understanding that they are promoting a strong, differentiated supermarket brand, not merely serving as passive landlords of shelf space.' The A&amp;P official notes that soft drinks have played an indispensable role in promoting the chain's entire range of Master Choice private-label products. 'It's the one item that has brought the name Master Choice to the marketplace,' he says. Not everyone, however, is convinced that Cott's long-term future is assured. Some analysts have questioned its aggressive accounting practices. Its chairman, Mr Gerald Pencer, is an entrepreneur whose last venture - a Canadian trust and loan company - ended in failure. Coke and Pepsi's increasingly aggressive response has also raised doubts about whether Cott's spectacular growth of the past two to three years can be sustained. Its margins have lately been squeezed in several key markets, including Ontario. Cott's first-quarter earnings may have been impressive, but they were less impressive than many investors anticipated. PepsiCo and Coca-Cola can console themselves that their new rival's share price has also fallen more than 10 per cent in the past week.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Sirte, 27 June (MENA) -- [passage omitted]  Al-Qadhdhafi said that the recent proposal adopted by the Arab  League on the Lockerbie case could be the only solution for this  crisis. He added that this proposal, which "is convincing and  satisfactory for all the parties," will be submitted to the  Security Council by the Arab group, the nonaligned countries,  and the African states and could be accepted because it is not a  Libyan one.    In his remarks on developments in the Lockerbie case, Col.  al-Qadhdhafi said that there are now strong suspicions that  Libya is not the sole defendant in this case but that there are  several parties, especially after the confessions of Yusuf  Sha'ban, who is being tried before a Lebanese court.    On tightening the sanctions imposed on Libya, he stressed  that his country is ready to confront any situation. But he  expressed his belief that the European countries will be the  only losers in this.    On his meeting with the wife of Mansur al-Kikhya [Libyan  dissident who disappeared while in Egypt], al-Qadhdhafi said:  We met and I stressed to her that the security organs in Egypt  and Libya are fully cooperating to uncover the truth. He  pointed a finger of accusation at the U.S. intelligence and its  Libyan agents.</p>

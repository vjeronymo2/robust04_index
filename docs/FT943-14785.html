			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Minister confirms contact with BR Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, said at the Commons employment committee yesterday that he had told members of the British Rail board on June 9 that Railtrack's 5.7 per cent interim pay offer to the RMT transport union conflicted with government guidelines. However, Mr MacGregor denied he was involved in the 'details' of negotiation. In a written memorandum to the committee, the Department of Transport said that it had been made clear to Railtrack that any increases in pay for signal workers had to be 'offset by improvements in efficiency and productivity and the package must represent value for money'. During his session with the committee Mr MacGregor said he hoped the two sides would return to negotiations and there could be an early settlement of the dispute. He pointed out that signalling staff had enjoyed a 47 per cent real improvement in their earnings since 1980 and benefited from the introduction of new technology and increased investment. This compared with a 37 per cent increase in real earnings for all manual workers in the country. Yesterday's talks at Acas brought only a Pounds 50 improvement in Railtrack's offer of a one-off cash payment. The RMT said Railtrack had refused to add that sum to basic pay rates, while the company replied that its offer was only an opening one. The union wants the company to increase the size of the pay package from an overall figure of Pounds 4.3m. 'The costs appear to be set in concrete, mixed at Department of Transport headquarters in Marsham Street,' said Mr Knapp. There are no plans for further talks.</p>

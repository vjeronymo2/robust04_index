			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporters Gao Xinghua 7559 5280 5478] and Li </F> Guoli [2621 0948 0448]]    [Text] Qinshan, 16 Dec (XINHUA) -- China will develop  nuclear power on many fronts, and within 20 to 30 years will  create a line of nuclear power plants that will ease the energy  crunch.    A high-level official of the Chinese nuclear industry said  today that the nuclear power industry hopes to build multi-unit  nuclear power bases along the coast. The economic prosperity of  the coastal areas makes the poverty of energy resources in those  areas all the more striking.    Experts estimate that by 2020, installed nuclear power  capacity on the mainland could reach 20,000MW, raising its  proportion of the total annual electric power output of the  country from the presently weak 1 percent up to about 5 percent.    China's energy resources are unevenly distributed, and the  shortage of energy resources in the eastern and southern areas  is particularly evident. Economic, safe, and clean nuclear power  is one way to end the energy crisis, and reduce the  transportation pressures and the harmful environmental effects  caused by thermal power. China will pursue an electric power  development strategy of "lead with thermal and hydropower,  supplement with nuclear power," and will give consideration to  building more nuclear power plants in the coastal areas.    In their individual development of nuclear power plants,  Zhejiang and Guangdong have been very constructive. Other  coastal provinces that are now expressing their interest in  building nuclear power plants are: Jiangsu, Liaoning, Hainan,  and Shandong, some already making early-stage preparations, and  others proceeding with commercial discussions. The development  of China's nuclear power industry will be done cautiously. The  official added that financing is China's biggest problem because  of the high costs and long construction periods required.  Investment resources for future nuclear power construction must  come from many sources, through national and local investments,  raising money locally, bank loans, and foreign loans and export  credits.    China welcomes foreign investments as a means to speed up  electric power construction through joint ventures with foreign  investors, or independent investments in thermal and hydropower  projects, but whether foreign investments can be accepted in the  nuclear power arena hasn't been decided yet.</p>

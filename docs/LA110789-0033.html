			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. BALKS AT YEAR 2000 AS DEADLINE TO CUT GREENHOUSE GASES;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: THE WHITE HOUSE INSISTS IT WANTS TO COMBAT GLOBAL WARMING. IT  MERELY SAYS THAT NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO SET FIRM GOALS.  </P> <P> Although insisting that the United States has led the world in steps to protect  the environment, the Bush Administration came under intense public pressure  Monday to adopt an ambitious goal of stabilizing emissions of so-called  greenhouse pollutants by the end of the century.  </P> <P> The heat came from Europeans, the government of the Netherlands and  environmental activists, as well as the head of the U.N. Environmental Program,  who warned: "It is almost a virtual certainty that our planet faces  unprecedented climate change. In the face of catastrophic possibilities, we  cannot await empirical certainty. We know enough right now to begin action."  </P> <P> But Environmental Protection Agency chief William K. Reilly and White House  science adviser D. Allan Bromley, appearing at a global warming conference  convened here by the Dutch government, declared that this is neither the time  nor the place to set a deadline or limits on the emission of greenhouse gases.  They are so called because they trap radiation and have been responsible for a  slow but measurable warming of the Earth's atmosphere.  </P> <P> Barring an eleventh-hour turnaround, the U.S. delegation will refuse to endorse  the crucial paragraph of a declaration calling for stabilization of greenhouse  gases in the atmosphere by the year 2000.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Reilly said the Administration "will be prepared to go as far and  as fast as the rest of the world" to meet the threat of pollution-caused  warming of the climate, although "to imagine that we will develop policies in  total lock-step is illusory."  </P> <P> Crucial language for a declaration to be issued at the end of the conference  was still being negotiated Monday night. Mostafa K. Tolba, director of the U.N.  Environmental Program, said there was still movement toward a general accord.  </P> <P> "Ninety-five percent of the countries consider that it is their responsibility  that they should stabilize the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse  gases no later than the year 2000," he said.  </P> <P> When the conference ends today, Tolba said, he expects all of the conferees to  adopt the principle of atmospheric stabilization -- but to include language  indicating that some of them oppose establishing the year 2000 as a deadline.  </P> <P> Even before the arrival of environmental ministers in this city near The Hague,  working-level officials from 61 countries spent nearly three days trying to  shape a declaration that could get a consensus.  </P> <P> In addition to the United States, other countries resisting the key provision  contained in a Dutch draft declaration include Britain, Japan and the Soviet  Union. The declaration calls for carbon dioxide emissions to be trimmed by 20%  from 1988 levels by the year 2000, enough to "stabilize" the atmosphere so that  further measures could produce a reduction of energy-trapping gases.  </P> <P> Although attention has focused on the United States and other world powers  resisting the deadline and the emission target, Reilly said that a majority of  Third World countries would resist such a requirement if given a chance to vote  on it.  </P> <P> Developing countries now produce only about 30% of the carbon dioxide being put  into the atmosphere, but their share is expected to increase as development  progresses. The United States alone, with its massive use of fossil fuels,  produces nearly a fourth of the total.  </P> <P> In a declaration along the lines of the Dutch draft, leaders of private  environmental organizations from 22 countries urged the ministers to adopt the  20% reduction and the turn-of-the-century deadline.  </P> <P> Produced after a two-day conference in Rotterdam last week, the unofficial  declaration called for the wealthier industrialized nations to provide  technical and financial assistance to enable developing countries to meet the  goals.  </P> <P> The private groups urged completion of a framework convention on climate change  next year and adoption of an international accord on carbon dioxide reduction  by the end of 1992. They noted that 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide have been  emitted into the atmosphere since the Paris economic summit called for  "decisive action" on global warming last July.  </P> <P> Representatives of the environmental groups criticized the United States and  its allies for opposing a deadline and reduction targets.  </P> <P> "Waiting for scientific certainty," said Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned  Scientists, "is not responsible policy." Dan Becker, an official of the Sierra  Club in Washington, charged that decisions for the U.S. delegation were being  relayed from the White House and that Bromley, the President's science adviser,  had been sent along to "handcuff" Reilly, the U.S. delegation chairman.  </P> <P> The EPA administrator and the science adviser appeared together at a press  conference shortly before Reilly addressed the delegates, and Bromley declared  the two of them in accord on the U.S. position. The Bush Administration is  conducting a "crash program" of research to understand the greenhouse  phenomenon and long-term global warming, Bromley said.  </P> <P> "In no way are we hanging back," he said, "and this reflects the President's  firm personal commitment in keeping the United States in a leading position."  </P> <P> In his address to the conference Monday afternoon, Reilly stressed U.S. support  for developing a strategy against global warming through the Intergovernmental  Panel on Climate Change, established under the auspices of the United Nations  and the World Meteorological Organization.  </P> <P> The IPCC is due to meet in Washington in February. After that meeting, Reilly  told reporters, the United States will be prepared to begin negotiation of a  framework convention on climate change, if other nations agree.  </P> <P> Tolba, who was working to iron out differences with the holdouts, agreed with  the U.S. contention that the conference here is not an occasion to negotiate a  formal agreement.  </P> <P> But, he said, it is important that the conference "give a signal" when it  concludes today, and in his address to the opening session Monday morning and  in remarks at a press conference, he appeared to be speaking to the United  States.  </P> <P> Noting that automobiles account for 10% of the fossil fuel burning, he said  carbon dioxide emissions from motor vehicles will increase by 75% by the end of  the century if efficiency continues at the current 20-m.p.g. average.  </P> <P> "This is not acceptable," the U.N. official said.  </P></p>

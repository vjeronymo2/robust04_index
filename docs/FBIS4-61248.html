			<p>BFN     [Text] Moldova's Deputy Premier Valentin Kunev regards as  possible the restoration of financial and economic relations  between Kishinev [Chisinau] and Tiraspol in their former volume.  There is every chance for that, he said in an interview with  INTERFAX on Wednesday.    In his opinion, the recent top-level talks between Moldova  and Transdniestria "have created a political situation that  makes it possible to do it." He disclosed that Moldova's  National Bank would unveil its office in Transdniestria shortly,  and through this body "a system of mutual crediting would be  devised and put to work."    As he put it, "by launching a mechanism of mutual accounts,"  Kishinev and Tiraspol will be able to "resolve the issues that  have piled up in power engineering, communication, and other  fields." In his words, "common approaches have been found to  how the Tiraspol airport should operate." "Moldova, Kunev said,  is ready to help reopen it the best it can, but only after the  Tiraspol authorities persuade the 14th Russian Army, controlling  the military airport, to make it municipal property.</p>

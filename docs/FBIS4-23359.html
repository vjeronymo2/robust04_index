			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Danial arap Moi in Nyayo Stadium, </F> Nairobi, on 1 June -- live]    [Excerpts] My dear Kenyans, ladies and gentlemen: We  assemble here today to celebrate the 31st anniversary of the day  we attained self-government, this is Madaraka [self-government]  Day. This day is an important one because it marks the first  significant step made by our people in their struggle to be  free. [passage omitted]    Ladies and gentlemen, we are celebrating this year's  Madaraka  day against a background of optimism and suffering by our  people. We are all aware of the many social and economic  hardships that ordinary Kenyans have had to put up with in the  last two years due to worldwide economic recession whose effects  were made worse by prolonged drought. During the same period we  have had to implement far-reaching economic and political  reforms. That we were able to successfully undertake  comprehensive reforms is a testimony of the resilience of our  nationhood. Indeed, few countries in Africa would have gone  through such a transformation without the risk of social  turmoil. I am therefore most grateful to Kenyans, particularly  the ordinary men and women who bore the brunt of most of these  reforms. I am equally grateful to our friends who have tried to  understand the negative social impact some of the measures have  had on our people. In spite of these short-term setbacks, I am  convinced that the reforms that we have implemented would lead  to renewed to economic growth and prosperity for our people.    What is urgently needed, and my government is taking  adequate  measures, is to sharpen the reforms and to focus on the social  dimensions of development. This should be done by developing  programs in all the relevant ministries to address the basic  needs of the poor and disadvantaged in search of security, food,  school fees and textbooks, medical services, transport and  water. The identification of needy cases and the provision of  assistance will be done by the local relief and welfare  committees. My government has already started these programs by  providing school fees and safety nets for those retiring from  the public service. My government is also making budgetary  provisions to strengthen this program in the 1994-95 financial  year. I am, however, making a very strong appeal to the donor  community to join us in refocusing the structural adjustment  programs to an approach which meets all the noble ideals of  balanced development.    Ladies and gentlemen, as I said during the recent  international investment conference, my government is fully  committed to a market driven economy which will attract foreign  investments. However, my government is concerned with the  increasing marginalization of sections of our population as we  open up the economy to market forces. This is an area which  cannot be left to market forces alone and that is why ways and  means must be found to cushion the vulnerable groups from the  adverse effects of economic liberalization. As we grumble with  the effect of these reforms it must be understood by all that  the concept of transparency and accountability is not expected  to be applicable only to the people of Kenya, for to do so is  tantamount to saying that Kenyans cannot be trusted or be relied  upon, that would be most unfair. Recognizing that no society on  earth can claim to be perfect, we will continue to serve our  people in the best manner possible. In turn, we expect foreign  organizations and institutions based in Kenya, especially the  nongovernmental organizations, to conduct their affairs openly,  fairly and with due regard to the laws of this country.    Dear Kenyans, as we celebrate this day when we attained  internal self-government it is also appropriate to review the  political atmosphere in our country. Seventeen months ago we  held the elections which ushered in a multiparty Parliament.  The elections were preceded by intensive political activities,  which unfortunately, divided Kenyans along ethnic lines. Today,  long after elections were concluded, Kenyans still look at one  another with suspicion. Some leaders continue to regard  themselves as the guardians of the interests of their supporters  only. Besides, some leaders continue to spend a lot of useful  time politicking rather than guiding Kenyans into  development-related activities. Indeed, one of the reasons why  the economy performed poorly last year was because of our people  spending many man hours in unproductive activities.    Fellow citizens, it is upon you to decide on your future and  as your president I urge you to choose hard work for prosperity  and development. Kenyans are known for their determination,  commitment, and hard work. Indeed, since independence the  culture of hard work, unity and love for one another has been  responsible for the significant development that the various  sectors have registered. Regrettably, we risk losing the culture  of hard work, tolerance, and unity of purpose if we continue  engaging ourselves in activities that would not benefit anyone.  Tribalism is on the rise. Politicization of almost every aspect  of our social life is getting entrenched and an increasing  number of Kenyans are spending their most valuable times in idle  talk. This has to stop. Ladies and gentlemen, the time to  arrest this situation is now. We must ensure that tribalism  does not gain a foothold in our society. After all, the many  patriots who made it possible for us to be free people set aside  their ethnic differences in order to pursue their common  objectives. It is therefore incumbent upon all leaders from  KANU [Kenya African National Union], the opposition, the clergy  and other categories of leadership to demonstrate their  commitment to a united Kenya.    On my part, I will always, as I have done throughout my  political carrier, champion the interests of all without fear or  favor. Events taking place in neighboring countries should  serve as a reminder to Kenyans to guard against divisive  politics. As I have often said it is the ordinary mwananchi  [citizen] who is the innocent victim when a chaotic situation  grips any country. My government will not tolerate leaders who  are bent on inciting people or diverting their efforts from  those which enable them to earn their livelihood in a peaceful  atmosphere. Equally, the government will give all necessary  assistance to leaders who are genuinely interested in helping  Kenyans improve their standards of living. I have deliberately  emphasized the need for us to remain united because I genuinely  believe that Kenyans have a right to live in peace with one  another. Indeed, that was the main reason our forefathers waged  a bitter struggle to win freedom from political domination.  Leaders bent on inciting Kenyans and wasting their times are  betraying the very spirit which was the driving force behind the  struggle for independence. [passage omitted]    Ladies and gentlemen, events taking place in other parts of  Africa are both disturbing and regrettable. Indeed, unless the  unwarranted killings and displacement of people stops our  continent faces a very bleak future. The loss of lives taking  place in Rwanda, Somalia, and southern Sudan must stop. There  can be no justification for such a heavy toll of human lives.  Regrettably, the loss of lives taking place in some parts of  Africa is happening at a time when donors are increasingly  diverting interests from the continent. African leaders must  appreciate that the continent is on the verge of complete  marginalization from the rest of the world. We must act now to  save this continent from social turmoil or disintegration. On  our part, Kenya will continue to participate in efforts to bring  lasting peace to conflict-torn parts of Africa. In view of the  serious concern I attach to problems facing the people of  Rwanda, I have requested my colleagues President Mobutu Sese  Seko of Zaire, President Hassan Mwinyi of Tanzania, and  President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda to join me in a meeting  which is being proposed for 6 June, Monday. But I am not  optimistic of this meeting, because of the complicated tragedy  which took place in Rwanda. Because it is so complicated, no one  hopes for a clearer future.    Many international communities all over the world wonder why  neighbors are not rushing to save Rwandans. It is because of  that complication. I pray God that Rwandan leaders will be  shown the right way to protect the lives of the innocent  children, women, and the entire Rwandan people. The state of  genocide that gripped that country is indeed chilling and  unbearable. It must come to an end, if that country is to move  forward.    My fellow countrymen, the conflicts which face some African  countries should make us Kenyans resolve to maintain peace which  we have enjoyed since independence. We owe it to future  generations to build a united, peaceful, and prosperous country.    As we celebrate this year's Madaraka Day let us once again  renew our commitment to live in peace, love, and unity with one  another. May God bless you all. Thank you.</p>

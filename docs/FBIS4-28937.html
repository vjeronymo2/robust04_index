			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a broadcast report from Seoul on 13  June, the U.S. imperialist Armed Forces of aggression in South  Korea staged a farce by making a show of Apache assault  helicopters. The U.S. imperialist war mongers were bent on  inciting a war fever by babbling that the assault helicopters,  which they brought in last March as part of their maneuverings  to reinforce the Armed Forces aimed at a northward invasion, are  high performance helicopters. The U.S. imperialist war mongers  also made a show of Patriot missiles not long ago and staged a  farce of demonstrating how to operate those missiles.</p>

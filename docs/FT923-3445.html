			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / International Company News: Zuckerman takes lead in battle for the NY Daily News MR MORTIMER ZUCKERMAN, the owner of US News and World Report magazine, took the pole position last night as the leading contender to acquire The Daily News, the loss-making New York tabloid that was formerly owned by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. A New York bankruptcy judge gave Mr Zuckerman six days to achieve an agreement with both creditors and a key trade union. On Thursday night aides to Mr Conrad Black, the bidder previously thought most likely to succeed, admitted they could not reach an accord with trade unions because they could not match the offer made by Mr Zuckerman. Mr Martin Maleska, an investment banker representing Mr Black, said Mr Black would only return to the fray 'if Mr Zuckerman is unable to complete the transaction'. Mr Zuckerman already has the support of eight trade unions at The Daily News. But the Newspaper Guild, which represents editorial staff, is resisting his insistence on the right for him to change staff without regard to the existing seniority system. A lawyer for the newspaper's creditors committee told Judge Tina Brozman in New York the committee was unhappy with Mr Zuckerman's offer to pay Dollars 18m of the Dollars 42m owed by the newspaper. Mr Black had offered the creditors Dollars 22m. The News meanwhile agreed to postpone staff pay cuts on the understanding that if Mr Zuckerman achieved deals with all unions by next Thursday he would provide a Dollars 3m bridge loan to the paper.</p>

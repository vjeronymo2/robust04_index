			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Output falls 0.6% in first quarter: Recession continues into seventh quarter - Order books at best level since 1990 A FURTHER fall in UK output during the first three months of this year has dragged the longest post-war recession into its seventh successive quarter. Overall gross domestic product fell 0.6 per cent in the first quarter and 1.5 per cent compared with the corresponding period last year. The fall in output for the whole economy, excluding oil and gas extraction, was 0.4 per cent compared with the previous quarter. This brought the annual rate of decline to minus 1.6 per cent. The figures from the Central Statistical Office show that this recession has been longer but not as steep as the recession of 1979-81. Non-oil GDP has fallen 4.3 per cent over seven quarters from a peak in the second quarter of 1990. This is only two thirds as deep as the 1979-81 recession, when non-oil output dropped 6.2 per cent. Overall GDP has fallen 4.2 per cent against the 5.5 per cent decline of 1979-81. The decline in manufacturing output has been only half as severe this time round. Since the second quarter of 1990 manufacturing output has fallen 7.7 per cent. This compares with a 16.4 per cent fall in output from the second quarter of 1979 to the first quarter of 1981. So far, output of the services industry has fallen by 2.4 per cent, the same drop as in 1979-81. In the first quarter of this year the services industries' output was 0.3 per cent lower than in the previous quarter. Manufacturing output, however, grew by 0.3 per cent, the first quarterly rise since the recession began. Oil and gas extraction output fell 4.3 per cent on the previous quarter because of maintenance works, while the mild winter was responsible for a 4.2 per cent drop in other energy and water supply. Manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers in the UK reduced their stocks in the first quarter of this year by Pounds 173m after a fall of Pounds 1.41bn in the fourth quarter of last year, according to provisional figures from the CSO. Within this, retailers increased their stocks by Pounds 228m following a decrease of Pounds 148m in the fourth quarter.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 19 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Chinese  Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said today that concerned  authorities in China are putting Wei Jingsheng under house  surveillance [jian shi ju zhu 4148 6018 1446 0145] and the  report that he is being indicted is groundless.    A reporter asked at today's news conference: It is said that  Wei Jingsheng will not be re-indicted on treason charges. Will  he be indicted on other charges? In reply Wu Jianmin made the  above statement.    Another reporter asked: Most recently there have been  reports that demonstrations and protests had occurred in Lhasa,  and that some foreigners in Tibet had their passports  confiscated or were expelled from Tibet. Will you please  confirm these reports?    Wu Jianmin said: I have not heard of such incidents. There  will not be any problems for foreigners in China as long as they  obey Chinese law.    Wu said: We should be aware that some people are deeply  prejudiced against China, always attack and spread talk against  China, and start rumors to confuse people. They do these things  with ulterior motives. In any case, these words do not merit  our attention or trust.</p>

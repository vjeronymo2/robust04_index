In the case of a nonagreeing association, the Farm Credit Administration may require a revision of the allotment sufficient to enable the bank to make the payment to the Farm Credit System Financial Assistance Corporation, provided that the association would continue to meet its minimum permanent capital requirement. The Farm Credit Administration Board may, at the request of one or more of the institutions affected, waive the requirements of this paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(G) if the Board deems it is in the overall best interest of the institutions affected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A Farm Credit Bank or agricultural credit bank and a recipient, other than an association, of allocated earnings from such bank may enter into an agreement specifying a dollar amount and/or percentage allotment of the recipient's allocated earnings in the bank between the bank and the recipient. Such agreement shall comply with the provisions of paragraph (e)(2) of this section, except that, in the absence of an agreement, the allocated investment shall be allotted 100 percent to the allocating bank and 0 percent to the recipient. All equities of the bank that are purchased by a recipient shall be considered as permanent capital of the issuing bank. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) A bank for cooperatives and a recipient of allocated earnings from such bank may enter into an agreement specifying a dollar amount and/or percentage allotment of the recipient's allocated earnings in the bank between the bank and the recipient.

All equities of a bank that are purchased by a recipient shall be considered as permanent capital of the issuing bank. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Where a bank or association invests in an association to capitalize a loan participation interest, the investing institution shall deduct from its total capital an amount equal to its investment in the participating institution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 620_DISCLOSURE TO SHAREHOLDERS <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 10.

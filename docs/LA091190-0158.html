			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Irvine -- Irvine Councilwoman Paula Werner was quoted out of context in a story  Friday. Werner's comment, "It's all coming down to partisan politics, when we  should be concentrating on local issues," did not refer to the controversy over  seating Mary Ann Gaido on the council but to Measure F, which seeks to move  city elections from June to November.  </P></p>

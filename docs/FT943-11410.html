			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Car registrations 'set to beat 2m' The Retail Motor Industry Federation, representing the UK's 7,000 franchised dealers and other independent motor traders, yesterday raised its forecast for new-car registrations this year to more than 2m. The first 2m-plus projection to be made by a big industry association came as dealers were engaged in a flurry of activity to deliver the first M-registered cars to customers when the plate becomes legal at midnight on Sunday. The federation's latest figure of 2.01m units compares with its previous forecast of between 1.8m and 1.9m. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the largest trade and lobby organisation, is predicting 1.95m. The federation's upward revision, the second this year, reflects consistent buoyancy in the marketplace - but also 'intensive marketing activity by manufacturers and dealers', said Mr Neil Marshall, the federation's policy director. Mr Marshall said the activity was expected to 'force' registrations beyond the 2m mark. The federation would not clarify Mr Marshall's remarks, but it is understood to have concluded that manufacturer pressure to 'move metal' is exaggerating the true size of the market through dealers pre-registering cars without buyers, and which may be later have to be sold as 'nearly-new' vehicles through auctions and other outlets. Registrations in the first half of this year have already reached 956,000 and the society has predicted 500,000 registrations for August - in spite of a survey commissioned by National Breakdown showing more than half of motorists want the annual registration change scrapped. The survey found that 34 per cent of motorists considered it an 'excuse' for the trade to increase prices, and 27 per cent viewed it as an 'exercise in snobbery'. Of the 500,000 August registrations expected, manufacturers' order books for companies such as Citroen, Peugeot and Volkswagen indicate that more than 100,000 of the total will be diesel cars, confirming their status as the fastest-growing sector of the car market. According to Citroen, on some of its model ranges such as the ZX estate, diesel versions are outselling their petrol equivalents. In a further survey by Volkswagen, in which 63,000 car owners were questioned, 10 per cent were found to drive diesel cars - but 30 per cent said they would be buying a diesel when their car was replaced. More than 340,000 diesel cars were sold in the UK last year. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars is ending production of its Pounds 170,000 Corniche convertible and similar Bentley Continental models after 23 years.</p>

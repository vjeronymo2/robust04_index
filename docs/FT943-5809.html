			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Bank regulators propose new rules US bank regulators are proposing new capital adequacy rules to take account of banks' exposure to risk from their derivatives holdings. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates nationally chartered banks, yesterday published the new rules for a two-month comment period, and the Federal Reserve Board has also proposed similar rules. An OCC official described the proposals as a 'refinement', but said they could require banks to hold more capital to offset the risk of some of their derivatives holdings. The new rules would change the factors which estimate exposure, by converting the notional principal amount of derivatives contracts into the equivalent of loan, and would sharply increase the factors for contracts linked to equity, precious metals other than gold, and commodities. Earlier international standards for bank capital adequacy ratios agreed by the Basle committee on banking supervision did not explicitly cover this kind of contract, but many national bank supervisors, including the US, have informally allowed banks to use the conversion factor applied to exchange rate contracts, which is 1 per cent for less than one year and 5 per cent for longer. Under the new rules, gold would still use these factors, because its volatility is estimated to be comparable to foreign exchange contracts, but other contracts would be weighted more heavily. Equity-linked contracts would have a conversion factor of 6 per cent of notional principal amount for maturities under one year, 8 per cent for one to five years and 10 per cent for longer terms. Other precious metals would be weighted at 7 per cent for maturities up to five years and 8 per cent for longer. Other commodities would be weighted at 12 per cent up to five years, and 15 per cent for longer maturities. The proposed rules would also recognise some netting arrangements that banks enter into with partners as a way of reducing potential future exposure.</p>

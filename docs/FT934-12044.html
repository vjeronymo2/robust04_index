			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: On-site contractor behind AAF's fall to Pounds 11m loss AAF INDUSTRIES, the mini-conglomerate which issued two profits warnings in quick succession after a rights issue in April this year, yesterday reported interim pre-tax losses of Pounds 10.98m compared with profits of Pounds 2.26m. The losses stemmed directly from expansion of AAF's prefabricated building manufacturing business, which it bought in 1989, into an on-site contractor. This business had operating losses of Pounds 10.8m in the six months to June 30. The group will also incur an additional Pounds 7m cost in the second half following the decision to close this business and transfer some of the manufacturing activities to Brandesburton. On April 1, AAF announced a 1-for-4 rights issue at 175p which was 97.6 per cent subscribed. Three months later the group made its first profits warning, followed by a second in September. The sudden fall in the company's fortunes will embarrass Hambro Magan, its merchant bankers, but also KPMG, the auditors. AAF said yesterday that the task of establishing the financial position of the Blackburn business was made more difficult partly because of 'incomplete accounting records'. Investors and the company will question whether any of the costing procedures or management controls were already inadequate at the time KPMG signed off on last year's accounts. They will also be concerned that KPMG will have revisited AAF ahead of the April rights and apparently found nothing amiss. AAF said its debt at the half year had risen from Pounds 18.6m to Pounds 21.97m and had risen substantially since. W&amp;A Investment Corp, the South African company that controls 43 per cent of AAF, has guaranteed and provided funding of Pounds 9.1m. Losses per share were 58.2p (11.3p earnings).</p>

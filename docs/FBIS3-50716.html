			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 6 Jan (Notimex) -- The Mexican  Government announced today that Guatemalan national Jesus  Sanchez Galicia has acknowledged participating with the armed  rebels operating in the southeastern Mexican state of Chiapas  after having received military training in Guatemala. The  office of the Attorney General of the Republic (PGR) pointed out  that Sanchez Galicia "participated in two clashes in an area,  tentatively identified as Tekom," where at least 40 members of  the armed group that appeared last Saturday in the state of  Chiapas were killed. The PGR details in a communique that when  Sanchez Galicia was questioned after his arrest, he indicated  that he had received "commando" training in Guatemala where he  had learned to use long range and large caliber weapons.  Sanchez Galicia, according to the PGR communique, said that he  had also participated in the takeover of the community of  Ocosingo where members of the so-called Zapatist National  Liberation Army [EZLN] had an intense encounter with the Army  before withdrawing.    The communique notes that following the Ocosingo incidents,  Sanchez Galicia escaped into the mountains and subsequently  boarded a bus headed toward Villahermosa, capital of Tabasco, a  southeastern state neighboring Chiapas. Both Chiapas and  Tabasco border Guatemala.    Mexican authorities reported this Wednesday that they had  captured 34 Zapatists, including Sanchez Galicia, after the EZLN  violently attacked several communities and clashed with the Army  in encounters which according to official reports resulted in  hundreds of casualties.    The PGR points out that Sanchez Galicia was assembling  another group that was preparing operations in a region called  Nueva Era, near the city of Champoton in the southeastern state  of Campeche.    The communique explains that Sanchez Galicia was captured at  a checkpoint set up along the Chiapas-Catazaja junction in  Tabasco, bordering Chiapas. Checkpoint officials, the PGR  communique adds, decided to question Sanchez Galicia, who was  travelling on a bus, because of suspicious looking "scratches"  on his body and his soiled clothes.    Sanchez Galicia was turned over to federal attorney general  agents who continued the investigation.    The communique also states that authorities have obtained a  "composite sketch" of the so-called "Commander Marcos," who has  been identified as one of the main Zapatist leaders. He is  male, 1.74 meters tall, athletically built, light dark skin,  approximately 25 years old, deep green and very large eyes, dark  hair, straight and broad nose, round face, average mouth, and  bushy eyebrows. The PGR added that two specific features of the  so-called "Commander Marcos", who supposedlly speaks two  languages, is that he is pockmarked and bald.</p>

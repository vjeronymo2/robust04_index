			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / International Company News: Canada defers action on O&amp;Y aid THE Canadian government for the time being will not offer any financial assistance to Olympia &amp; York, the debt-burdened property developer. The political risk of bailing out the wealthy Reichmann family, which owns O&amp;Y, and the success so far in containing the fall-out from O&amp;Y's troubles have led the government to defer taking a decision on a loan guarantee requested by O&amp;Y and its lenders. The guarantee is required to facilitate the sale-and-leaseback of the 36-storey Exchange Tower building in Toronto. O&amp;Y needs funds from the deal to retire a commercial paper programme secured by the building. A senior government official said yesterday that Ottawa would 'hang back and watch for a bit'. The cabinet has yet to consider any proposal to support O&amp;Y. The government's hesitancy reflects public resistance, including in many business quarters, to the use of public funds to prop up O&amp;Y. The Globe &amp; Mail newspaper said in a weekend editorial that there was 'no public policy interest in shielding the Reichmanns, their banks or the banks' shareholders from the consequences of their actions'. An executive with one of the country's largest property brokers said many agents would welcome any weakening of the grip that O&amp;Y and another large developer, Cadillac Fairview, have on the downtown Toronto office market. The government had considered helping O&amp;Y, which is world's biggest property developer, when it appeared O&amp;Y's troubles might destabilise the banking system and currency markets. However, the chief executives of O&amp;Y's two biggest creditors, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Royal Bank of Canada, have said that write-offs of their portions of O&amp;Y's USDollars 12bn debt would have only a limited impact on their earnings. Disgruntled holders of unpaid commercial paper remain a potential threat to O&amp;Y's stability. Under the trust indenture of the Exchange Tower commercial paper programme, the trustee is obliged to declare O&amp;Y in default if more than 25 per cent of holders ask it to do so. Royal Trust, the trustee for the programme, said it would act 'in the best interests of our note-holders'. The trust company is reported to have set up a special committee to consider the delicate fiduciary issues raised by O&amp;Y's delay in redeeming the paper. Mr Donald Wright, president of Merrill Lynch Canada, one of seven securities dealers that made the market in O&amp;Y commercial paper, said he still expected 'a happy outcome' on the commercial paper issue. In keeping with their obligation to create a secondary market, several securities firms, including Merrill Lynch, still hold inventories of Exchange Tower paper. Mr Wright noted that O&amp;Y had scrupulously repaid, with accrued interest, another commercial paper programme on which redemptions were delayed by its liquidity crisis last month.</p>

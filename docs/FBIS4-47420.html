Loshchilov, V.A. Kashparov and V.P. Protsak </F> (Ukrainian Agricultural Radiology SRI, Kiev) under the  ``Radiation Hygiene'' rubric; received 5-27-92; UDC  614.73-07(477)]    [Abstract] When planning measures aimed at decontamination  of settlements in the territory contaminated with radioactive  substances as a result of the Chernobyl AES(ChAES) accident one  should take into account the possibility of secondary  radioactive contamination caused by natural factors (wind  transfer, horizontal migration with sewage etc.) or  anthropogenic contamination. The authors studied the likelihood  of secondary radioactive contamination of a decontaminated  settlement when agricultural work is performed. Studies were  conducted in a settlement located 45 km NNW from the accident  power unit. During the period of studies there was no  precipitation, and air and the soil humidity was low. Analysis  of the obtained data showed that dust transfer of radioactive  substances within a 5 km radius during agricultural work had no  significant effect on secondary contamination of the settlement.  It is concluded that natural factors and technogenic action on  soil cover, including agricultural work, have no tangible effect  on secondary radioactive contamination of decontaminated  settlements located in a territory with [.sup]137[/]Cs  contamination of up to 2 MBq xm[.sup]-2[/]. However, it is  noted that in extreme situations (tornadoes, dust storms, forest  fires etc.) dust transfer of radioactive substances can have  substantial effect on secondary contamination of the territory  and warrants additional studies.

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: Indian steel maker rises 18% to Rs630m The Steel Authority of India (Sail), the country's largest steel producer, lifted net profit 18 per cent to Rs630m (Dollars 20m) for the six months to the end of September due to increased sales and cost-cutting, writes Kunal Bose in New Delhi. Sail's performance contrasts sharply with that of Tata Iron and Steel, the country's second largest steelmaker, which recently reported a sharp fall in profit. Sail, a state-controlled enterprise in which the government has sold a 10.52 per cent stake to private shareholders, stands out as among the most efficient of India's large state-owned industrial enterprises.</p>

			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'BILLBOARD POLICE' HELP ADVERTISERS GET MONEY'S WORTH  </P> <P> Trying to attract more listeners during the summer, radio station KTWV-FM, "the  Wave," plastered many thousands of dollars worth of billboards all over town.  </P> <P> The outdoor ads, which said "Because life's too short for ordinary music," were  purchased from several big billboard companies for as much as $5,000 a month  each.  </P> <P> With those kinds of price tags, KTWV executives decided not to just take the  word of the outdoor ad firms that all the boards would magically appear on the  prescribed dates. Instead, the station hired a company that specializes in  monitoring billboards. What they discovered was appalling. More than 20% of the  billboards that the station purchased were not up on time or were in some way  damaged.  </P> <P> "It's not that the billboard companies are trying to rip anyone off," said  Bonny Benedict, director of creative services at KTWV. "It's just that there  are so many billboards in Los Angeles. It's a huge animal to control."  </P> <P> So KTWV, like some others, turned to a relatively small Paramount company, ACI  Outdoor Audit, which has made a business out of doing the dirty work for  outdoor advertisers.  </P> <P> During the night, ACI sends crews out in trucks to make certain that every  billboard, bus banner or transit shelter ad a client pays for is up -- and in  good condition. Call them billboard police, if you will. Some billboards are  damaged by vandals or weather. Some have lights that fail to go on. And worst  of all, some ads aren't even up.  </P> <P> Clients are charged 1% to 2% of their outdoor ad budgets. Generally speaking,  the company charges $5 each to check smaller billboards and bus signs, and $25  each to monitor giant painted billboards. That can add up fast, considering  that many of its clients have from 100 to 500 billboards to monitor.  </P> <P> It is no irony that ACI chose the Los Angeles market. With so many commuters,  the Southland is the largest outdoor advertising market in the country, with an  estimated 40,000 billboard, transit shelter and side-of-bus ads. As a result,  advertising executives say, nowhere is the problem of billboard discrepancies  more acute than it is here. Radio station KTWV, for example, was given many  thousands of dollars in future advertising credits as a result of ACI's  billboard audit.  </P> <P> "Outdoor (advertising) is the only business where advertisers spend millions of  dollars and never know if they're getting full value," said Ben Somers, who two  years ago founded ACI's billboard inspection division. Magazine advertisers  usually get copies of the ads. And radio and TV advertisers are often sent  signed affidavits that the ads appeared. But generally speaking, there is no  accurate verification for outdoor advertisers.  </P> <P> "If you're a billboard advertiser here, you've got to audit," said Jack  Kornarens, a billboard industry consultant in Studio City.  </P> <P> No one is saying that the billboard companies intentionally rip off clients.  But whatever the reason, said Somers, billboard advertisers often don't get  everything they pay for.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, the big billboard companies take exception to that. Gannett  Outdoor Advertising, one of the billboard giants, figures that its billboard  postings in the Los Angeles market are correct about 98% of the time -- and  nearly 100% in other markets.  </P> <P> "In Los Angeles we generally don't make 100% because of the size of the market,  the sheer number of ads and all of the last-minute changes by advertisers,"  said Robbynn Lystrup, sales service manager at Gannett. But she said Gannett  has no objections to these new audit companies. "We're not afraid to find out  when we've made a mistake."  </P> <P> The other giant billboard firm in Los Angeles, Patrick Media, declined to  comment.  </P> <P> One of the largest Los Angeles companies that specializes in buying billboard  space for advertisers insists its clients get what they pay for. "We place 25%  of the outdoor business in Los Angeles," said Mark Barnes, chief executive of  the Sherman Oaks-based office of Outdoor Services Inc. "And less than 1% isn't  up on time."  </P> <P> Executives at the Outdoor Advertising Assn. of America, an industry trade  group, said it was the first time that the notion of outside billboard  monitoring had been brought to their attention. "It's certainly the right of  any client to have any oversight they want," said Kippy Burns, a spokeswoman.  </P> <P> Of course, many commuters in Southern California might feel that the fewer  billboards around the better. So what if some billboards or bus shelter ads get  blitzed?  </P> <P> Well, advertisers certainly don't feel that way. Recently, KNX radio was  informed of nearly $27,000 in outdoor advertising discrepancies after a  billboard audit by ACI. "I'm a big believer in outdoor advertising," said Fred  Bergendorff, director of advertising and promotions at KNX. "But I wouldn't do  it without some type of auditing."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HCFC&hyph;123 is being proposed as a streaming agent to replace Halon 1211, both in pure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> form and in blends. HCFC&hyph;123 could replace Halon 1211 at a ratio of 1.8 by weight_a ratio  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considerably better than that of most other streaming substitutes. HCFC&hyph;123 has the lowest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ODP of all the HCFCs proposed as halon substitutes, and its global warming potential (GWP)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is half that of other HCFC substitutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFC&hyph;124 is being proposed as both a total flooding agent and a streaming agent,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both alone and in blends. HCFC&hyph;124 has relatively low ODP and GWP values. Animal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing indicates that the substance may be lethal to rats at a level greater than 23 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over a four hour period. Due to its cardiotoxic profile, this agent is not suitable for use in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total flooding applications in normally occupied areas. However, pending personal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring tests to assess actual exposure, it is possible that this agent could be used as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> streaming agent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hydrofluorocarbons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) have also been suggested as halon substitutes. HFCs are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physical action agents and are less effective than halons or HBFCs. Due to their reduced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficacy, larger storage volumes are required for use in fire protection systems. Their great  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advantage over halons, HBFCs, and HCFCs is that HFCs have an ozone depletion potential of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> zero. However, when exposed to fires, HFCs potentially decompose into greater amounts of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hydrogen fluoride (HF) than do HCFCs, depending on the number of fluorines in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> molecule. Discharge of these chemicals onto a fire must be rapid or early to prevent the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> buildup of large amounts of these decomposition products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, HFCs can potentially contribute to global climate change. Because of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential, HFCs are included in President Clinton's Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this plan, EPA is directed to limit uses of greenhouse gases as substitutes for ozone-depleting compounds. Because EPA is simultaneously also interested in promoting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> broader shift away from ozone-depleting compounds, any limits on use will be imposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wherever possible in ways that preserve as much flexibility for those trying to move to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternatives as possible. To minimize unnecessary emissions of greenhouse gases, EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommending that users limit testing only to that which is essential to meet safety or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance requirements; recover HFCs from the fire protection system in conjunction with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing or servicing; and recycle recovered agent for later use or destruction. Manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of these agents must recognize their responsibility to prevent unnecessary emissions of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gases. Product stewardship programs may be a useful mechanism to help users meet these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. EPA will reexamine how to control unnecessary emissions of greenhouse gases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HFC&hyph;23, HFC&hyph;32, HFC&hyph;125, HFC&hyph;134a, and HFC&hyph;227ea have all been proposed as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total flooding agents. HFC&hyph;134a and HFC&hyph;227ea have also been proposed as streaming  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agents. HFCs tend to possess less risk of acute cardiotoxicity than do the HCFCs or HBFC-22B1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HFC&hyph;32 has been determined to be flammable, with a large flammability range, and is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore inappropriate as a halon substitute. In the next SNAP update, EPA intends to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propose listing this agent as unacceptable in total flood applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Perfluorocarbons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are fully fluorinated compounds which do not contribute to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ozone depletion. In addition, PFCs are nonflammable, essentially non-toxic, and are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VOCs. PFCs are effective fire protection agents, having the lowest required extinguishing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration of any of the suggested substitutes other than HBFCs. However, these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds have high molecular weights, which create weight and storage replacement ratios  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are somewhat higher than the HCFCs and many of the HFC candidates. Two PFCs have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been submitted as halon replacements: Perfluorobutane (C <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) as a total flood replacement for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Halon 1301, and perfluorohexane (C <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) as a substitute for Halon 1211. In the NPRM, these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agents were referred to as FC 3&hyph;1&hyph;10 and FC 5&hyph;1&hyph;14, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The principal environmental characteristic of concern for PFCs is that they have long  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> atmospheric lifetimes and have the potential to contribute to global climate change. PFCs are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also included in the CCAP which broadly instructs EPA to use section 612, as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> voluntary programs, to control emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While PFCs are extremely persistent, their favorable toxicity profile makes these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agents attractive for use in occupied areas. Thus, EPA believes that there are instances in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which PFCs represent the only viable alternative to transition away from the CFCs or halons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency is finding use of PFCs acceptable only for applications where reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efforts have been made to determine that no other alternatives are technically feasible due to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance or safety requirements. However, as with all of the substitutes which are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greenhouse gases and ozone-depleting substances, EPA recommends that users limit testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only to that which is essential to meet safety or performance requirements; recover agent from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fire protection system in conjunction with testing or servicing; and recycle or destroy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agent that is recovered from a system. In addition, EPA encourages manufacturers to develop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aggressive product stewardship programs to help users avoid such unnecessary emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA will reexamine how to control unnecessary emissions of greenhouse gases in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Chlorofluorocarbons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) have also been proposed as halon alternatives, either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individually or in blends. These compounds are also class I substances, however, and as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> matter of policy EPA will not encourage shifting from one class I substance to another,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> despite the fact that the ODPs of the CFCs are significantly lower than those of Halons 1211  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 1301. EPA does not believe it is appropriate to encourage shifting to substitutes that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to be phased out in the near term. In addition, the sale and distribution of CFCs in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressurized dispensers (in this sector, portable fire extinguishers) are controlled under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 610(b) of the CAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Blends.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of manufacturers have proposed proprietary blends of chemicals for fire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection applications. These blends combine a variety of CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs, PFCs, inert  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gases, and other additives to achieve desired levels of effectiveness, toxicity, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decomposition products. Most of these blends contain constituents that have non-zero ODPs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and GWPs. In assessing the ODP and GWP of such blends, the Agency has examined both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the weighted average of the constituents and the individual characteristics of the constituents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because toxicity varies with the exact composition of the blend, EPA requires cardiotoxicity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests to be conducted on the blend itself, rather than being inferred from the constituents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Non-halocarbon alternative agents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Non-halocarbon alternative agents such as CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , dry chemical, foams, and water that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are currently in widespread use and that are covered in NFPA standards and OSHA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations may also be used as substitutes for halon. These agents are not as widely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable as the halocarbon substitutes, and must be used where recommended by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers and approved by standard-setting entities such as the NFPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, several manufacturers have developed new technologies to adapt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> traditional agents to the halon market. Two manufacturers have developed inert gas blends as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Halon 1301 substitutes in total flood systems. One of them, containing CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  mixed with inert  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gases has already been included in the new NFPA 2001 standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Water sprinkler systems are capturing part of the halon substitute market, often in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conjunction with improved detection systems and risk management programs which isolate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the degree of liability in a given fire event. A promising new water technology incorporates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fine water droplets to create a water mist or fog. It has been suggested that water mist  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems are safe for use on Class A and B fires, and even can be used on Class C electrical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fires without causing secondary damage. Because the environmental, health and safety issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the various types of water mist systems have not yet been fully addressed, EPA is listing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water mist as pending in this rule, and will work with NFPA, manufacturers, and others in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to include it in the next SNAP update.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

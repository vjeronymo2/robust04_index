			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Arts: Paris's musees sentimentaux FOR almost a century, the small suite of rooms on the first floor of the Musee Gustave Moreau in Paris were swathed in dirt and dustcloths, unseen by the public, seldom visited even by the museum staff. The dustcloths have now been whisked away. The woodwork is freshly papered and painted. There are pictures on the walls. The rooms have been restored to look as they did when the artist Moreau himself lived and worked there. The first floor apartment at the Musee Moreau has joined the ranks of Paris's musees sentimentaux. Paris has a dozen or so 'musees sentimentaux' - museums based in the homes of writers or artists. Gustave Moreau himself was one of the pioneers of the concept, devoting his last years to raising money and bullying builders to turn his home on the rue de la Rochefoucauld into a showcase for his life's work. The Musee Moreau opened in 1903, five years after the artist's death. It houses a comprehensive collection of his work - 1,200 paintings and 5,000 drawings - everything from juvenile scribblings to giant oil paintings. The brutal truth is that, without the museum, much of Moreau's work would not have been preserved. Even in his own day, Moreau was better known for his teaching - his pupils included Henri Matisse and Georges Rouault - than for his art. From time to time, he has attracted a minor cult following, but the quality of his paintings - dreamy visions, generally of Greek gods and goddesses in mildly salacious poses - is not high enough to merit much space in the major museums. None the less, the Musee Moreau, with its winding wooden staircase and dusty windows, is a charming place. Even the most salacious of Moreau's classical fantasies have a certain appeal. Although there is no hint of his tutelage of Matisse in the sombre colours of his work, it is not difficult to spot his influence over the morose Rouault. For decades, the museum has been a little known but much-loved fixture on the Paris arts scene. Moreau hoped to create more than an art gallery. He also planned to preserve the tiny apartment on the first floor of the rue de la Rochefoucauld where he lived with his parents. The renovation of the apartment was ignored in the bustle of opening the museum, and the family rooms remained closed for nearly 90 years. Three years ago the museum staff decided to carry out Moreau's wishes by renovating the apartment. An inventory was made of the contents and an architect, Jean-Claude Daufresne, charged with restoring the rooms to their original condition. The result is an intriguing glimpse into the home of a mildly eccentric Parisian painter in the late 19th century. The rooms have been decorated in the same style as when Moreau was in residence. The restorers have also reassembled as many of his possessions - paintings, photographs, pieces of pottery and memorabilia - as they could. The apartment is now a cheerful clutter of books, clothes, crockery, stuffed birds, pictures, plants and even a couple of newspapers folded neatly on a table. Thanks to the restoration, which was funded both by private patronage and state sponsorship, the Musee Moreau is probably the most complete of all Paris' musees sentimentaux, just as Gustave Moreau intended it to be. All in all, the musees sentimentaux are a motley crew. Some show exhaustive collections of the artist's work. The Musee Rodin, set in a splendid 18th century mansion on the rue de Varenne, not only houses most of the sculptor's main pieces, but also part of his own art collection. Rodin had so many paintings that Van Goghs, Monets and Renoirs hang haphazardly on the walls looking almost like an after-thought. Some collections are almost too exhaustive. The tiny Musee Zadkine near the Luxembourg gardens, devoted to the work of Ossip Zadkine, the cubist sculptor, is so packed with pieces that it is almost impossible for visitors not to bump into them. Other musees sentimentaux are rather sparse. The Musee Delacroix, set in a cloistered courtyard off the Boulevard St Germain, was founded so long - nearly 70 years - after Eugene Delacroix's death, that his work was already widely dispersed. The museum has a modest collection, mainly of prints, drawings and personal documents. Anyone wanting to see Delacroix's major works would be better advised to head for the Musee D'Orsay a little further along the left bank. The museums also vary enormously in architectural quality. Musee Rodin is probably the most sumptuous of all, with its wood panelling, mottled mirrors, crystal chandeliers and a private garden which almost serves as a small Parisian park. The closest contender is the Maison de Victor Hugo tucked away in a corner of the 17th century Place des Vosges where the writer lived with his family. By contrast the Musee Bourdelle, devoted to one of Rodin's pupils, Antoine Bourdelle, is set in a dusty little studio and garden buried beneath the brutal blocks of Montparnasse. And the musee sentimental of as famous a figure as the novelist, Honore de Balzac, is in a squat villa in the boringly bourgeois suburb of Passy - now the stamping ground of the bon chic bon genre, the French version of the Sloane Ranger - to which Balzac fled to evade his creditors. The architectural merits of the musees sentimentaux are not really relevant, however. The real charm of this type of museum is the flavour evoked of the person who lived there. However sumptuous the Musee Rodin may be, it is impossible to go there without thinking about all those wimpy women that allowed Rodin to treat them so badly. On the other hand, the otherwise inconspicuous Maison de Balzac resonates with the raffish character of the novelist. It even has little boltholes at the back so Balzac could sneak out, if his dreaded creditors came to call.

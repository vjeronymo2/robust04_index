			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Sport: Soccer competes with a freak show It's rough in Washington DC. The American football team is pathetic this year, the basketball team cannot find the basket, nobody cares about the toothless ice hockey club and we have not had a baseball team for nearly a quarter of a century (we will not have a football team either if Jack Kent Cooke, the owner, moves the Redskins to some racetrack in Maryland). But we are not alone; it is rough all over the US. Although the college game thrives, professional football has become boring, says no less an authority than Sports Illustrated. The best quarterbacks are ancient, such as Joe Montana, or injured, the victims of the awful artificial turf. The air has gone out of basketball with the retirement of Michael Jordan and it has been reduced to recruiting Gheorge Muresan, a 7ft 7in Romanian with pituitary problems, and Shawn Bradley, a former Mormon missionary an inch shorter, as if the embarrassing performances of Manute Bol, a 7 ft 6 in ex-herdsman from Sudan, were not a warning. Baseball players are paid too much to play with any enthusiasm and the talent is too diluted by expansion. Purists were appalled by, though strangely drawn to, the ineptitude that characterised much of the last World Series. Ice hockey is so desperate for fans that it is being played near Disneyland, light years from its frozen northern home, by a team called the Mighty Ducks. The only golfer of interest is John Daly and mostly for what he does off the course. Juvenile tennis stars burn out with monotonous regularity. No wonder the US is becoming addicted to the virtual reality of video games. It is tempting to conclude that soccer, coming here in the shape of the World Cup next year, is pushing on an open door. Millions of children, girls included, play it because it is cheap and safe. There may be no professional game played outdoors but college soccer is starting to resemble the real thing. There is a young man from New Jersey, Claudio Reyna, the University of Virginia's midfield player, who is coveted by the wealthy clubs of Italy and Spain. When the US national side beat England last June it made the front page of the sports sections with lots of funny headlines. There is already a black market for tickets for all the World Cup games and about one-fifth of them are going to appear on national television. Such temptations should be resisted. Soccer will get a boost from the World Cup but it must be at least a generation away from establishing itself as a 'major' sport in the US. There are lots of sober reasons for this view, including lack of money and the problems of adapting a sport with no artificial break other than half-time to a television system so dependent on commercial breaks that an American football game of one hour's actual playing time typically lasts three hours. But these are only half the problem. The first is size. Thighs and long hair apart, there is nothing physically distinguishing about soccer players. They may be marvellous athletes in their own right, but they look - well, ordinary, and Americans like to associate themselves with the extraordinary. Football features 300 lbs linemen capable of running down ball carriers barely two-thirds the weight. People flock to watch Daly hit a ball further than any successful golfer has. The American sports fan might like to think that he, sometimes she, can emulate their feats. So they buy jumbo drivers and once in a blue moon the taller ones succeed in slamdunking a basketball into the net in their driveways or throw perfect spirals in a touch football pick-up game. But it is all a dream, whereas soccer, played by ordinary looking people, is closer to gritty reality, from which sports are supposed to provide an escape. Then there is the statistical problem, which runs far beyond the fact that there are not enough goals in soccer. Americans prefer sports with high scores, which is why the 16-14 World Series victory by Toronto over Philadelphia was so compelling. Americans are consumed by the numbers which lie behind the final score, as even a glance at any US newspaper's sports page attests. Assists, tackles, errors, yards, balls, catches, pitches, averages, blocked shots, turnovers, saves, minutes played and much more besides are all minutely catalogued. Soccer can provide only a fraction of this numerical diet, which not only forms the stuff of every sports talk show and post-game office conversation but serves as a measurement by which players may reasonably fairly be compared, even over generations. All that is left of Bobby Charlton are fond memories and flickering black-and-white film, but Ty Cobb, who played in the first 20 years of this century, is still there in baseball's statistical compendium. Player image also does not seem to work in soccer's favour. There is a debate among US professional sportsmen over whether or not they should serve as role models. Charles Barkley, who plays basketball for the Phoenix Suns with unreserved passion, rejects this imposition and Jordan's well known gambling flouted it. But it is a burden mostly accepted by the stars, even to the point of mind-numbing blandness in, for example, golf (broken only when some of the Ryder Cup team complained about having to meet Bill Clinton because he had just increased taxes on their vast incomes). Most sports have severe sanctions for those who transgress off the field by use of drugs or alcohol. Soccer, on the other hand, seems stuffed with renegades, roustabouts and lawbreakers, at least according to the European tabloid press. Maradona, easily the best known player coming to the US for the World Cup, would definitely be on a suspended list if he were playing here. The final problem for soccer is that US sports are never static and always respond to even the hint of discontent. When pitchers became too dominant in the 1960s, baseball made it harder for them by lowering the height of the mound. Football is forever tinkering with its rules to make life safer for the quarterback and easier for the wide receiver, basketball introduced the three-point shot and the time clock and ice hockey cracked down on fighting (a mistake since a good brawl was always as much of an attraction as the artistry of Gretzky and Mario Lemieux.) Soccer's comparable options seem more limited. And there are always great players in the pipeline to revive interest. Baseball has a clutch of budding stars in their mid-20s, basketball can replace Jordan with Shaquille O'Neal, Alonzo Mourning and Shawn Kemp, Troy Aikman-to-Michael Irvine can supplant Montana-to-Jerry Rice who supplanted Terry Bradshaw-to-Lynn Swann, Eric Lindros supplanted Gretzky and so on. Here in DC, we will go to RFK stadium to catch, if we can find a scalper, whoever the World Cup draw gives us and we will expect to be entertained, even by Saudi Arabia. But - seriously - we will still be more interested to see if the decline of the once-great 'Skins is reversible or if, 40 miles down the road, Rafael Palmeiro, the new Dollars 30m (Pounds 20.1m) first baseman, can bring a pennant to the Baltimore Orioles. After all, to paraphrase a great politician, all sport is local and soccer merely a world sport.</p>

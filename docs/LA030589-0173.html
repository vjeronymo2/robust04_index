			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDEN NEWS: A GARDENER'S DREAM  </P> <P> Here's a new dwarf shrub that's almost too good to be true. Dipladenia Red  Riding Hood, a cousin of the beautiful but infamous climbing vine Mandevilla,  has stunning tube-shaped cherry red flowers, glossy green foliage and sturdy  growth. Unlike Mandevilla, it grows vigorously and is not stingy with its  blooms. What's more, insects and diseases ignore it. This new dwarf shrub will  be effective in a patio pot or hanging basket because it stays compact and  blooms continuously. Along the coast, it likes full sun; inland, it requires  some shade from midday sun. If it begins to vine, it's getting too much shade;  if its leaves become light green, it's getting too much sun. In a pot, it needs  regular fertilizer and pinching to keep it bushy. Red Riding Hood is available  at many garden centers. Mary Ellen Guffey  </P></p>

JUDGE OKS HOLLY FARMS BUYOUT  </P> <P> A Delaware judge approved today a tentative agreement allowing Tyson Foods Inc.  to buy Holly Farms Corp. for $1.4 billion, a lawyer for Tyson said.  </P> <P> The agreement, filed by lawyers for Tyson, Holly Farms and ConAgra Inc.,  requires approval of the Holly Farms board of directors, said Jim Blair, chief  legal counsel for Tyson.  </P> <P> "It sets the stage for a three-party settlement. I'm cautiously optimistic,"  Blair said.  </P> <P> Blair said the proposed agreement requires Tyson to pay ConAgra $50 million to  withdraw from the bidding for Holly Farms. The buyout will cost Tyson about  $1.4 billion, Blair said.  </P> <P> Tyson has been trying to buy Memphis-based Holly Farms since October while  Holly Farms has been trying since November to merge with ConAgra, based in  Omaha, Neb.  </P></p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Stand-off in search for EU chief: Kohl opposes Dutch PM as replacement for Delors A stand-off between Germany and the Netherlands is holding up efforts to break the deadlock over the succession to Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission ahead of this week's EU summit in Corfu. Chancellor Helmut Kohl remains opposed to Mr Ruud Lubbers, Dutch prime minister, and is canvassing support for Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, who formally announced his candidacy last Friday. The implicit threat of a German veto at the Corfu summit has irritated the Dutch government. Mr Lubbers has sought to call Mr Kohl's bluff by offering to pull out of the race, but only if the German chancellor took public responsibility for blocking his candidacy, according to senior diplomats in Brussels. Efforts to reach a compromise could turn on a meeting of Christian Democrat leaders on Wednesday in Brussels, two days before the opening of the Corfu summit. Mr Kohl, Mr Lubbers and Mr Dehaene are all due to attend. Belgian officials believe Mr Dehaene can count on as many as eight EU member states to support his candidacy. Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, and the UK remaining are said to be opposed or uncommitted. The choice of the Commission president is traditionally settled in secret by unanimity among the 12 heads of government. A stalemate boosts the chances of victory by a compromise candidate, either Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, or Mr Peter Sutherland, outgoing head of the Gatt world trade organisation. Greece, which holds the rotating EU presidency, fears that controversy over the Delors succession could poison the summit atmosphere and overshadow the visit of President Boris Yeltsin of Russia. Mr Yeltsin arrives in Corfu on Thursday to sign a new trade and political agreement with the Union. Senior diplomats in Brussels said a compromise could be reached in the form of a 'package deal' covering top posts at the Western European Union, the EU's defence arm, the European Council secretariat, as well as the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development. But Greece's authority has suffered as a result of its unilateral trade embargo against neighbouring Macedonia and partly because Mr Andreas Papandreou, the ailing 75-year-old prime minister, is too weak to make the customary pre-summit tour of EU capitals. The result is that Mr Kohl has emerged as the principal EU powerbroker, his status enhanced by his Christian Democrat party's strong performance in last week's European parliamentary elections. One favoured scenario would give Germany the post of secretary general of the European Council secretariat and Spain the top job at the WEU. EU leaders would also agree to back Mr Renato Ruggiero of Italy and Lord Lawson of the UK as European candidates for the World Trade Organisation and the OECD. Mr Kohl is also said to be willing to consider supporting Mr Lubbers as successor to the ailing Mr Manfred Worner at Nato. Topics at the Corfu summit will include a progress report on implementing the European Commission's White Paper on growth and unemployment; approval of 11 new rail and road projects known as trans-European networks, subject to further study and without a commitment for new financing instruments; and the signing of the EU accession treaties by the leaders of Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway. Greece is also expected to make a pitch for the opening of accession negotiations with Cyprus on January 1, 1995 - but few expect EU leaders to commit themselves to a firm date.</p>

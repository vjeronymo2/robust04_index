			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / BBA falls into red and plans payout cut BBA, the engineering group, yesterday warned it was planning to cut its dividend and shed 2,000 jobs as part of a rationalisation programme. The moves have been forced on the company by a slide in profits in its motor components business and shrinking margins in its aviation arm. After charges related to rationalising the businesses, BBA incurred a Pounds 12.8m pre-tax loss, compared with a Pounds 47.4m profit in 1992. Mr Roberto Quarta, chief executive, said the losses reflected Pounds 76.8m (Pounds 9.7m) in rationalisation costs for ongoing businesses, of which Pounds 59.7m has been set aside for redundancies and plant closures this year and next. The results were also hit by Pounds 17.8m of exceptional losses on selling or closing non-core businesses, while the group also wrote off a Pounds 3.8m investment in United Industries, the precision tools and springs manufacturer. These charges were offset by a profit of Pounds 18.4m on the sale of Pacific BBA, its partly owned Australian subsidiary. Faced with heavy provisions and depleted earnings, Mr Quarta warned that the 1993 dividend - unchanged at 7.5p - would be cut by up to 3p next year. 'Earnings are not growing fast enough to maintain current dividends - that is unacceptable,' he said. The announcement prompted a 9p fall in BBA's shares, which closed at 207p. Mr Quarta said up to 2,000 jobs would have to go as the company cut costs. Most of those job losses, on top of 1,000 redundancies last year, would be in the automotive division, where operating profits fell 42.8 per cent to Pounds 21.5m. 'We must go further and cut deeper to reduce our cost base to a point where we can deliver sustainable market improvements.' The company is understood to have identified nine companies which it would like to sell, reducing the total number of subsidiaries to about 40. Overall operating profits inched ahead to Pounds 89m, from Pounds 87.3m, while turnover increased 7.2 per cent to Pounds 1.42bn. Despite increased sales, Mr Quarta said: 'The recovery, where it is apparent, remains extremely fragile and we anticipate no meaningful improvement in Europe for some time.' Fully diluted losses per share were 6.6p before exceptional items and 5.1p afterwards, compared with 4.9p and 8.1p respectively. Lex, Page 22 Details, Page 25</p>

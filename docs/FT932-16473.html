			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / UDM miners reject strike call MEMBERS of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers have voted against holding a 24-hour strike over pit closures, Robert Taylor writes. They turned down the recommendation of their leaders calling for disruptive action by 3,673 votes to 2,943, in a vote of up to 70 per cent of the members. Mr Neil Greatrex, the union's president, expressed his disappointment at the outcome. He added that the union was ready to buy or lease collieries that British Coal wished to close. Negotiations are going on between the UDM, the mining engineers company R J Budge and British Coal over the future of Clipstone and Bevercotes pits on the Nottinghamshire coalfield. Both the pits are being mothballed under government plans.</p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAIWAN'S BID TO RESTORE PHONE, MAIL LINKS TO CHINA FALLS SHORT  </P> <P> A bid to deliver mail and open direct telephone links from Taiwan to China for  the first time in 40 years failed Saturday after planes refused to carry mail  bags and phone lines failed to connect.  </P> <P> Preliminary figures provided by the International Telecommunications  Administration showed that only several dozen calls could be made from Taiwan,  disappointing thousands who wanted to contact their families in China.  </P> <P> Hundreds of letters addressed directly to China could not be delivered because  several airlines refused to take them, the Directorate General of Posts said  without explanation.  </P> <P> The Nationalist government on Taiwan banned all direct communications with  China in 1949, when it was driven to the island by the Communists. But last  week, it said it would allow some direct links to be restored.  </P></p>

Of these studies, 10 were ranked as outstanding, and one  entitled the Environmental Radiological Study of the Republic of  Cuba won an award from the Academy of Science of Cuba (ACC), one  of the most important awards of all the institutions under the  ACC.    According to Sean, in the 1993 contest the introduction and  categorization of studies of previous years were made.    Among these studies is one of three varieties of rice in  which genetic traits were introduced via irradiation, and one of  the technology for activating polystyrene plates [placas de  polistireno], which are of great use for investigations of  various types.    During this period, different institutions sold and  contracted 12 pieces of equipment developed by specialists from  the Center of Applied Studies for the Development of Nuclear  Energy (Ceaden).    In addition, it was learned in 1993 Sean guaranteed the  country's basic services in the field of dosimetry and  radiological protection.    Sources of nuclear energy that were not being used in the 14  provinces and in the special municipality of the Isle of Youth  were gathered and rendered inactive and were taken to the  nuclear waste site near the outskirts of the capital.    During the period, nuclear experts were able to maintain a  stable functioning of the national network of radiological  operations.    Other works continued by Cuban atomic energy experts with  the  arrival of new patients concerns the evaluation of radiation  effects on children from Chernobyl at a tourist installation  east of Havana.    After a detailed study of current conditions, it was agreed  to maintain the nuclear option in the electromagnetic Cuban  system.    During the last six months of last year, work was done in  this regard, and a gradual national planning strategy was  devised to face the future programs of nuclear energy  development.    The construction of the first electronuclear center (CEN) on  this Caribbean island has come to a standstill due to the  difficult situation the Cuban economy is facing.    A program in which nuclear builders and experts will  participate was designed to offer maintenance to installation  programs. This will be done until conditions permit the  completion of the first two reactors in the central-southern  Province of Cienfuegos.    Meanwhile, qualified personnel of the first Cuban CEN have  devoted their work to applying nuclear energy to other fields,  so as to contribute to national economic development.</p>

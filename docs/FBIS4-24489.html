			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Flor Wang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 28 (CNA) -- Despite the geographic  distance, and language and cultural barriers separating them,  the Republic of China [ROC] and the Commonwealth of Independent  States should start to developing closer ties in bilateral  economic and cultural cooperation, Premier Lien Chan said  Saturday [28 May].    Lien made the remarks when meeting Nikolai I. Ryzkov, former  prime minister of the Soviet Union, who arrived in Taipei Friday  for a week-long visit.    As the ROC and CIS economies are of a complementary nature,  more cooperative ventures between the two sides should further  benefit both, Lien said, adding that the CIS' high technologies  and abundant natural resources would be a boon to the ROC, whose  experience in economic development could be helpful as a model  for the CIS as it charts a course toward a more open economy.    Ryzkov, who hopes to establish communication channels  between  the CIS and the ROC during this trip, agreed with Lien, saying  there is still ample room for growth in all fields between the  two sides, and that Taipei and Moscow should immediately begin  trade and economic cooperation as a first step to establishing a  full-range of cooperative ties.</p>

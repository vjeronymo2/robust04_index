			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Political Reshuffling Continues Over </F> Weekend"]    [Text] Rome, 30 Jan (ANSA) -- The reshuffling of the  Italian political scene continued over the weekend as the  Italian Social Movement [MSI], heir to the Fascist Party,  reorganised itself as a broader rightist grouping called the  National Alliance, the small Republican Party cast its lot in  with moderates at the centre of the political spectrum and the  Socialists pursued their search for a new identity.    After the vote in favour of the new course propounded by the  Social Movement's secretary, Gianfranco Fini, the party's  central committee was meeting here this afternoon to name the  candidates for the elections on March 27. The committee will  approve extending the political bureau to include  representatives of the internal opposition led by one of the  more radical of the old guard neo-Fascist ideologues, Pino Rauti.    In a speech this morning, Rauti accepted the Fini line and  urged that the party must be "as compact and united as possible"  at the polls. Even while admitting that, today, he would still  don the uniform he wore when, fifty years ago, he took part in  dictator Benito Mussolini's rump Fascist republic at Salo' on  Lake Como, he said the National Alliance should "choose from the  past what bears indications for the future." He also said there  was no going back to the laissez-faire economic theories of the  1800s "as though Fascism and Communism had never been.... For  my part, I wouldn't want to have taken part in the March on Rome  and a World War simply to arrive at laissez-faire."    More immediately, as the Italian Right sorts itself into new  configurations, apart from the ex-Christian Democrats of the  Democratic Christian Centre, the National Alliance's major  electoral ally will be TV tycoon Silvio Berlusconi's Rooting for  Italy movement, which is seen as a bridge between National  Alliance and Umberto Bossi's Northern League.    For Fini, Berlusconi is a possible prime minister: "As I've  said before, I rule myself out, and I don't think there is any  need to indicate a premier (before the elections). But if there  had to be a choice between Bossi and Berlusconi, I would choose  Berlusconi because he unites North and South, whereas Bossi  splits Italy in two."    Yesterday, Northern League leader Umberto Bossi took a  similar line when he launched the League's election campaign at  Rovigo near Venice, though he disagreed with Fini when he poured  cold water on Berlusconi's ambitions to become premier. "I  don't see him as the next prime minister," said Bossi, sketching  in a role for the tycoon as a "mediator" between the often  conflicting demands of northern and southern Italy.    Bossi also joined Berlusconi in identifying the Democratic  Party of the Left [PDS] as the major adversary, though he also  condemned the Vatican's statement of support last week for  Catholic unity, warning that "religion must return to caring for  souls, not politics."    These right-wing formations all sought to distance  themselves  from the former government parties which are still trying to  re-create the former bloc of moderate opinion that they  represented in the centre of the political spectrum.    At a meeting of the Republican Party's National Council  here,  Party Secretary Giorgio La Malfa argued for a "third position"  with figures such as ex-Christian Democrat Mario Segni, People's  Party (ex-Christian Democrat) Secretary Mino Martinazzoli, and  ex-Premier Giuliano Amato, identified closely with former  Socialist Party Secretary Bettino Craxi. While surprising his  audience by announcing that he would not be seeking re-election,  La Malfa ruled out any alliance on the right in a brusque  beginning and spent much of his time explaining why he excludes  joining the progressives with whom he has shared the opposition  benches since pulling the Republicans out of their traditional  slot in the ruling majority in mid-April 1992.    Like other political leaders, including PDS Secretary  Achille  Occhetto, La Malfa said the Italian political scene was  currently one of "great confusion." In particular, he said the  next parliament would have to complete the electoral and  institutional reform and also said he expects the future  scenario of political alliances to take some time to stabilise.    "I'm looking neither right nor left, but straight ahead,"  quipped Martinazzoli at a meeting of the People's Party in  Milan, who also said he would not be seeking re-election. He  added an ironic reference to the ex-Christian Democrat  Neo-Centrists who are expected to ally themselves with Fini: "If  you will allow me, calling oneself a `centrist' when you are  leaving the centre is something of an eccentricity. Moderation  is to 'moderatism' as chastity is to impotence."    But, in Florence, Rocco Buttiglione, the leading ideologue  of the People's Party, which many have accused of seeking to  postpone the elections so as it can regroup the moderates more  effectively, argued for a highly temporary vision of the coming  parliament. If a moderate bloc fails to win, he told reporters,  the best solution would be a government of non-party experts or  one named by the head-of-state to push through the "urgent and  indispensable" measures and then return to the polls when the  political options may be clearer.    Meanwhile, if Martinazzoli said he would be leaving the  political scene at the congress of the People's Party convened  in May, between the Italian and the European elections, the  Estates General called by Socialist Party Secretary Ottaviano  Del Turco was told that a congress was likely at about the same  time. Even though the Estates General voted no motion, one  bearing the names of 100 delegates urged the expulsion of  ex-Secretary Bettino Craxi and his closer aides for their  "evident political responsibilities" and their role in the still  unfolding bribery and corruption scandals.    Del Turco's speech returning the Socialists firmly to the  progressive and breaking with Craxi's location of the party in  the political centre received wide applause across the  progressive political spectrum. "A real turning-point," was the  comment from Occhetto, whose entry into the assembly hall was  greeted by the exit of a small group of Craxi faithful,  including his former spokesman Ugo Intini.    As the Socialists pursue what their present chairman, Labour  Minister Gino Giugni, described as the "restoration of the house  of Italian Socialism," a poll of delegates showed that 74  percent wanted no renewal of Craxi's party membership and 60  percent would like to see Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi  serve a second term. Other findings in the survey 43 percent in  favour of the resignation of President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro  immediately after the elections, a demand also advanced by  National Alliance, the Northern League and others because of  Scalfaro's apparent implication in alleged moves to cover up  financial misdeeds in the secret services.    Republican Party secretary Giorgio La Malfa's platform not  to  join the Progressive Pact and the Democratic Alliance, to which  many Republicans already adhere, was passed by a very slim  majority of 6 votes, 65 to 59, confirming the divisions within  the small party which may become official Monday [31 January].  Before the final vote was taken, La Malfa added to his document  a passage which said how he would make a "last-ditch attempt",  in his meeting tomorrow with the Democratic Alliance, to  convince PDS leader Achille Occhetto to drop the orthodox  Communist Renaissance and Leoluca Orlando's Rete from the  progressive pole. La Malfa went on to add how he in no way  underestimated Berlusconi's entrance in politics nor the  reinforcement of the Right. Nevertheless, he argued, there was  no solid rightist block from Martinazzoli to Fini, nor  Right-Left confrontation. Otherwise, La Malfa said "I would  have called everyone to the Left". This was not the case, the  Republican leader argued, because of the novelty of  Martinazzoli, steering clear to the Right, and the credibility  of Mario Segni.    Reaction to La Malfa's stand was predictable, with Massimo  D'Alema of the Democratic Party of the Left defining it as  "short-sighted", while praising La Malfa's decision not to run,  while Senate Speaker Giovanni Spadolini, the Republican deacon,  saw it as "coherent."</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Row looms over UK plan to resolve EC budget: Whitehall has its sights on a tough compromise to end the impasse over Community spending BRITAIN'S proposals for breaking the deadlock over the European Community budget are bound to cause a row when they are presented to community finance and foreign ministers in Brussels today. The idea of a 'tight and restrictive' package for the EC's future financing is unlikely to win instant friends among the member states lining the Mediterranean Sea. But the proposals, circulated to other governments yesterday as a presidency compromise, do provide for big increases in the transfer of funds to the four poorer community members compared with existing financing arrangements. It is on this basis that Whitehall hopes for a settlement when EC leaders meet for their next summit in Edinburgh in two weeks' time. The core of the British proposal is to raise the maximum size of the EC budget - the so-called own resources ceiling - to 1.25 per cent of community gross national product by the end of 1999 from 1.2 per cent at present. The ceiling would be frozen at the present 1.2 per cent for the three years starting in January, then raised to 1.22 per cent for 1996 and 1997 before being lifted to 1.25 per cent for 1998 and 1999. Using the Commission's latest assumptions for EC economic growth, this would increase the EC budget, expressed in 1992 prices, to about Ecu79.3bn (Pounds 61bn) by 1999 compared with Ecu61.1bn this year. According to UK Treasury figures, the EC budget would increase by an average 3 per cent per year in real terms, compared with about 5 per cent annually over the five years ending this year. The UK plan is tougher than those advanced by the Commission. The most recent official proposal from Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, was for a five-year budget deal that would lift the own resources ceiling to 1.36 per cent of GNP (Ecu81.9bn or Pounds 63bn) by the end of 1997. More recently, Mr Delors has been suggesting a package to lift the EC's budget to 1.32 per cent of GNP (Ecu83.2bn or Pounds 64bn) after seven years. But the big selling point from Whitehall's viewpoint is the doubling of so called structural and cohesion funds for Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland  -the four poorest EC member states - in the next seven years compared with the average of the past five years. Under the UK plan, the cohesion fund - a new pool of resources first agreed at the Maastricht summit a year ago - would total Ecu12.25bn (at 1992 prices) over the seven year period. Originally Mr Delors proposed Ecu10bn for five years, increasing this to Ecu15bn over seven years in his later informal plan. In addition, the UK proposes increases in commitments under the structural funds for poorer EC regions. These funds - covering regional development, the social fund and certain agricultural payments  - would rise to Ecu23.8bn by the end of 1999 from Ecu19.4bn at present. Mr Delors' proposal envisaged an increase in the structural funds to Ecu27.7bn after seven years. Britain has also proposed changes to the Community's complex revenue-raising rules that will help the weaker member states. These envisage a reduction in the role played by value added tax-related levies in meeting the community budget in favour of levies linked to the GNP of the member states. The UK plans no change to the present formula for financing farm spending, which is structured gradually to reduce the share of farm spending in the overall EC budget. Whitehall officials believe that the share of farm spending in total EC spending could fall to around 50 per cent by 1999 from 55 per cent at present. Britain wants a review of the so-called agricultural guidelines in 1996. But Britain wants changes in other parts of the budget. It has proposed a big increase in the Community's external spending - on programmes such as technical assistance for the new democracies of eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union and humanitarian and disaster aid for Africa - to Ecu5.3bn by 1999 from Ecu3.9bn at present. However, the figure envisaged for 1999 is lower than the Ecu6.1bn put forward by Mr Delors. Whitehall has taken a big axe to Mr Delors' plans to increase substantially internal spending on programmes such as research and development and trans-European communications networks. It is planned that these should rise no faster than EC GNP over the seven years. At the same time, the UK insists that the EC budget rebate, negotiated by Mrs Margaret (now Lady) Thatcher in 1984 should be subject to 'no adverse change' as a result of negotiations on the EC's future financing. The rebate, which returns to the UK 66 per cent of the excess of its contributions to the Community over its receipts, has been worth an average of Pounds 2bn a year since it was agreed. The UK's determination to keep its rebate is likely to raise the hackles of Community partners such as Germany and the Netherlands, which otherwise could be expected to applaud Britain's tough line on overall EC spending. The presidency compromise is not being put forward as a 'take it or leave it offer'. Whitehall recognises that it has to achieve consensus in a Community of 12 nations. But Treasury officials are hoping that the limits to own resources put forward in the budget plan will hold through the difficult negotiations that lie ahead. They point out that the UK itself recently completed its spending plans for the next three years and managed to hold its planned outlays for 1993-94 within a Pounds 244.5bn total that was set a year before. Britain will commend its experience with the Autumn Statement to its community partners. There will be no question of the community having to declare bankruptcy if there is no agreement on future financing at Edinburgh. The current 1.2 per cent GNP ceiling will continue indefinitely in the absence of a deal. But several other important policies hinge on an agreement, not least the enlargement of the community to include aspiring member states. When Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, detail the UK's EC budget plans today, they will make this linkage clear.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Two organisations, one public and one private, have  decided to open new offices in Vietnam to exploit an expected  increase in Thai business resulting from last week's lifting of  the U.S. trade embargo. The two are the Government's Board of  Investment [BoI] and the private sector's Thai Military Bank.  The BoI will set up an office in Ho Chi Minh City, its first in  Vietnam and seventh abroad, while Thai Military Bank says it  will apply for a representative office--and ultimately a  branch--in Hanoi to supplement its Ho Chi Minh office.    They see opportunities for Thai businesses both as suppliers  and contractors for an expected increase in investment in  Vietnam, and as manufacturers exploiting the newly created  opportunity of exporting from Vietnam to the United States.    In addition to the opening of a Ho Chi Minh City office, the  BoI's Vietnamese push will include an investment seminar next  month, similar to one organised last month in Phnom Penh and,  like the Phnom Penh event, timed to coincide with a visit by  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai. The Ho Chi Minh City office will  join the BoI's existing six offices abroad: in New York,  Frankfurt, Sydney, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Paris.    Board secretary-general Sathaphon Kawitanon said it would  also welcome the setting up of a special economic zone ("Zone  4") in Thai border areas to increase cooperation with  neighbouring countries and boost the competitiveness of Thai  investment.    Thai Military Bank's decision to apply for a second  representative office in Vietnam and ultimately a branch, both  in Hanoi, follows what the bank reports to be a profit at its Ho  Chi Minh City representative office after only one year.    Although Ho Chi Minh City is still considered to be the  larger business centre, bank executives believe that a presence  in Hanoi is needed to be closer to decision-making, including  those involving infrastructure.    Bank president Thanong Phithaya and his executives believe  that the lifting of the embargo will spark a growth in activity  for Thai businesses. This will partly be to support the  expected new American investment and related Vietnamese  infrastructure projects, and partly to use Vietnam as a  production base for exporting to the United States.    Dr Thanong said yesterday that Thai construction companies  were already studying opportunities. Construction materials  would also be needed for the project, executives sald.    Dr Wirasak Apharak, senior executive vice-president, said  that Thai garment manufacturers wanted to invest in Vietnam in  order to export to the United States because many categories of  garments made in Thailand have hit their quota limits. But for  the time being no one knows what exactly the trading terms will  be after the lifting of the US embargo.    Dr Thanong said he expected approval for the representative  office in Hanoi to be routine. Setting up a branch would take  longer.    Thai Military Bank is one of only two Thai banks represented  in Vietnam--the other is Bangkok Bank.    Executives say that while Bangkok Bank has concentrated on  larger Thai corporations doing business in Vietnam, Thai  Military Bank has been working with smaller operations,  particularly imports of goods from Thailand into the Vietnamese  markets where prices can be considerably higher. Dr Wirasak  said that almost all motorcycles in Vietnam were made in  Thailand and many were bought using Thai Military Bank credit.  Thai Military Bank is also considering applying for a  representative office and later a branch in Shanghai. It  already has a joint venture bank in southern China.    The rationale for setting up in Shanghai is similar to that  for Hanoi being close to where commercial decisions are being  made. Dr Thanong is due to make a business trip to Shanghai in  April. He said the request for a representative office was one  of the subjects likely to be discussed.    The BoI's first step in establishing an office in Vietnam  will be to send officials to cooperate with the Thai commercial  counsellor's office in Ho Chi Minh City in providing information  for Thai investors.    Mr Sathaphon said the BoI must pay close attention to  economic changes in Vietnam because with the lifting of the  embargo trade and investment in the region would expand.    Thailand should not worry about effects on Thai investment  in  Vietnam in four sectors in which the United States has expertise  which Thailand cannot match--food products, consumer products,  services and energy. Thailand should join the U.S. on  investment projects in energy, he said. Thailand had competed  for investment with countries such as other ASEAN members and  China for a long time. Vietnam would be just a new competitor.    Vietnam had an advantage in labour costs because in that  country these are just 10% of total investment outlay, he  said.  Raw materials, infrastructure, investment regulations, tax and  government policy were significant to foreign investors.  Vietnam wanted a long period to develop its electricity,  transport and airports.    Mr Sathaphon said Thailand must reduce costs and increase  its  skilled workforce to attract foreign investors. Thailand must  speed up development of infrastructure in remote areas.  However, Thailand's strategy was to develop supporting  industries which were small or medium-scale looking towards high  technology. Vietnam needed a long time to develop its industry.    Mr Sathaphon said the establishment of "Zone 4" in Thailand  might increase the competitiveness of this country's remote  areas.    The BoI has agreed in principle to set up zone 4 in horder  areas such as in the growth triangle. If the Government has a  clear policy on zone 4, the Finance Ministry, Commerce Ministry  and the BoI will cooperate to consider the details which cover  complicated aspects such as tax systems and quotas.    Mr Sathaphon said the BoI would join the Vietnamese  Government in holding a seminar on investment prospects in  Vietnam. More than 50 Thai businessmen were expected to attend  the session in March. The seminar will give Thai investors a  chance to meet state enterprise representatives from Vietnam for  talks on joint ventures.    Mr Chuan is scheduled to visit Vietnam in March.    Thais can invest in Vietnam in many areas such as mining  consumer products, light industries and agriculture, most of  them under state enterprises the Vietnamese Government wants to  privatise. Thailand has prospects of exporting spare parts and  construction materials to Vietnam which aims to double its Gross  Domestic Product by 2010.    The Vietnamese Government's development plan for the next  six  years envisages spending about US$40 billion, made up of $12-13  billion from foreign investment, $7-8 billion from domestic  sources and $20 billion from foreign loans.    The BoI reported that 119 foreign investment projects in  Vietnam in 1993 comprised 15.35% of total investment.  Taiwan  ranked first with 32 projects or 26.9% of the total  foreign  investment. Thailand was fifth with eight projects and  6.72% of  the total investment.</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dem plan for housing - News in Brief MORTGAGE interest tax relief should be phased out and replaced with a new housing cost allowance, targeted at the lower paid, and covering both rents and mortgages, the Liberal Democrats said yesterday. The party's 'Manifesto for Housing' said mortgage tax relief had created 'enormous economic and social problems without actually being of benefit to home owners'. Tax relief would continue to be available for existing mortgage holders. For those entering the housing market, relief would be available at a level equivalent to a proportion of housing costs - perhaps 50 per cent - between regionally-determined lower and upper limits. ***** DEFENCE: Mr Tom King, defence secretary, told the Commons yesterday that the final cost of the Trident nuclear missile submarine programme was now estimated to be Pounds 10.518bn. He said: 'This marks a further small reduction against last year's estimate and an overall real reduction of Pounds 3bn against the 1982 forecast'. He confirmed that the order for the fourth submarine at VSEL Barrow would be placed as soon as contract talks were completed. ***** ENVIRONMENT: Mr John Major is to host a Downing Street seminar today on the environment, attended by representatives of 'green' lobby groups and industrialists. Officials said the prime minister was preparing for the United Nations conference on environment and development which he hopes to attend in Rio de Janeiro in June.</p>

			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Books: Tales of resistance to Nazism - German opponents to Hitler acted with extraordinary courage AN HONOURABLE DEFEAT by Anton Gill Heinemann Pounds 20, 293 pages Between Hitler's assumption of power in 1933 and his suicide in 1945, three million Germans spent time in prison or concentration camps on political grounds or for Resistance activities. Efforts were made to overthrow Hitler, and a number involved assassination attempts: bombs in Smolensk, Gerdorff and Rastenburg, guns elsewhere; one man, Maurice Bavaud, tried to shoot him on three separate occasions. But Hitler seems to have had an evil inviolability. These facts, Anton Gill tells us in his history of internal German opposition to Nazism, speak for themselves. They bear witness that there was honour in Germany in those terrible years, when to go along with the criminal regime's excesses was easier by far than to dissent. Dissenters met with a brutal answer: torture, imprisonment or a Gestapo bullet were the likelihoods, yet nearly a tenth of the German population risked them. Gill is an historian and commentator who has made the Germany of the period brilliantly his own. In A Dance Between Flames, an account of life in Berlin between the wars, he anticipated some of what this book records: the courage of Germans faced with the cruel hubris, or the supine acceptance of the majority of their fellows. Opposition to Nazism came from the Social Democrats, the Communists, some churchmen, student groups, and the patrician right. Because the two former were organised parties with identifiable members - and because they were hopelessly at odds with each other and therefore ineffective as oppositions  -they were relatively easy for Hitler to destroy. He did so quickly, leaving only isolated groups of pastors, students and noblemen working uncertainly in a murderous environment of fear. The most dramatic of the attempts against Hitler is well known. It has just occupied centre-stage in the 50th anniversary celebrations of the German Resistance. On July 20 1944 a colonel in the German army, Count Claus von Stauffenberg, exploded a bomb in the conference room of Hitler's headquarters, the Wolf's Lair at Rastenburg, while Hitler sat consulting his staff. By a perverse miracle Hitler survived practically unscathed although a number of those sitting around him died. Back in Berlin a secret government-in-waiting was readying itself to take power. But the failure of the plot meant that within hours they and Stauffenberg were being dragged before a firing-squad. This vertiginous effort was motivated by the fear of some Army officers that if peace were not made quickly Germany would be pulverised. They were right, although they could not foresee the benefits this painful expedient would yield in the longer term. But it is not clear how much they were motivated by still deeper reasons: by horror at the slaughter of Jewry, and by opposition to the Gestapo state. Such resistance came from other quarters, from men like the theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who died in a concentration camp, or the student activists of the White Rose, a Resistance group that leafletted against the Nazi regime under its very nose during the height of the war. With terrible inevitability such people were arrested and shot or hanged. It is surprising how many of them there were, and with what extraordinary courage they acted. Gill details them all, and their tales make compulsive reading. One young man, Hans Scholl, who with his sister Sophie was executed by the Gestapo, was moved to resistance by witnessing the maltreatment of Russian prisoners and Jews. 'One day he gave his tobacco to an old man,' Gill relates, 'and his iron rations to a girl. The girl had thrown the rations back at him, but he had picked them up, plucked a daisy, placed it on the pile of rations, and laid them at her feet. After a moment's hesitation she had accepted them, and put the flower in her hair.' This story is emblematic of suffering on the one part, courage on the other. Struggle against tyranny is one of the noblest human endeavours, just as tyranny and oppression are amongst the most vile. In Germany during the Nazi years a Manichaean struggle was waged internally; an unequal struggle, because the evil was great, the complicity of the majority weighty, the resisters relatively few and their struggles fragmented. But it was an honourable struggle, full of hope for the human condition.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Fear of bombings pushes shoppers out of town FEAR OF terrorist bombings is causing shoppers to favour out-of-town retail parks instead of inner-city department stores, research published yesterday by Leicester University's Centre for the Study of Public Order shows. The study found that one in eight shoppers in Leicester had changed their shopping behaviour to avoid city centres, and one third of this group said they would not shop in London. More than 60 per cent said they had thought about the possibility of a terrorist attack on their usual shopping district. Mr Andrew Willis, senior lecturer in criminology at Leicester University, one of the two academics who carried out the study, said the perceived terrorist threat also explained a 'surprising' degree of public willingness to accept much tougher security regulations. Of the sample of 839 people, 70 per cent said they would be prepared to carry identity cards; 80 per cent would accept closed-circuit television inside shops; 40 per cent were in favour of armed police in shopping areas; 25 per cent were willing to accept armed security guards; and 50 per cent backed random road blocks and compulsory searches of bags and cars. However, 65 per cent of the sample said that they opposed compulsory body searches at stores. Mr Willis said: 'It's in the interests of retailers to take these results very seriously. The risk of a terrorist outrage is remote but nevertheless the fear is real. 'This has measurable consequences, though it's very difficult to say how it has affected the sales of city-centre stores. We tend to think shopping is a minor domestic chore; the reality is that it's a major part of the domestic economy - annual retail sales for 1992 were Pounds 368bn.'

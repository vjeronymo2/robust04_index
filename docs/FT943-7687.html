			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Business Travel: UK rail disruption Travellers to Britain today may be caught by the latest in a series of strikes by rail signal staff. The strike is part of what has turned into one of the most bitter industrial disputes since the year long 1984-85 miners' strike. The dispute is over a pay offer and plans for changes to working practices. British Rail is running a significant minority of services despite the strike.</p>

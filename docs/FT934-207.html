			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Leading Article: China unifies exchange rates The precise timing of China's decision to unify its exchange rate seems to have come as a surprise to some observers. What is more, the full implications remain vague. None the less, the decision is welcome, not only in itself, but for the indication it gives that Mr Zhu Rongji, vice-premier in charge of the economy and central bank governor, is able and willing to push needed reforms ahead. These must now be pushed further, in a number of directions. Unification of the exchange rate was a logical step. The only question was when it would be taken. At present, China has two exchange rates: an official rate of 5.8 yuan to the dollar and a floating rate of Yn8.7. The latter is not fully unified, however. It is set in a network of 100 regional 'swap centres', which were established in 1987 and remain incompletely linked to one another. Until now companies had to sell 20 per cent of their foreign exchange earnings to the state at the official rate, while the government had the right to buy another 30 per cent at the swap rate. The rest could either be retained or sold directly or indirectly, via so-called foreign exchange entitlements, in the swap markets. Those markets are far from free: not only does the government use the 50 per cent of foreign exchange it still controls to influence the rates, but access to these markets is also restricted. Economic liberalisation Despite these limitations, the introduction of the swap markets has made an important contribution to economic liberalisation. Already some 80 per cent of current account transactions are done at the swap rate. The official rate is used to tax exporters and foreign tourists. It also taxes foreign investors, who had to register capital in new ventures at the official rate, but were required to repatriate profits at the swap rate. At the same time, the official rate is used to subsidise imports by government organs, including state-owned enterprises, although the latter have been increasingly forced to use the swap market. Unifying the exchange rate will eliminate an important source of economic inefficiency, promote China's integration within the global market economy and shift management of the economy further towards uniform, market-oriented instruments and away from administrative discretion. Nevertheless, the move could have disruptive consequences. The US might, mistakenly, see a reduction in the official rate as predatory. The shift might also be condemned as inflationary, though effects on prices are, in fact, likely to be negligible. More significantly, the move will increase financial pressure on loss-making state enterprises and the government itself, for which improvements in tax collection will become still more important. But making subsidies more transparent may also make it politically easier to reduce them. Administrative reforms The fundamental question, however, is how far the implications have been thought through. At present those requiring to convert foreign exchange into yuan, or vice versa, have only a limited idea of how the system - which is to go into effect in just two days time - is to work. The International Monetary Fund is already involved in a programme to integrate 18 leading swap centres. There are also efforts under way to create an inter-bank foreign exchange market. Such administrative reforms must now be accelerated. Also urgent will be elimination of most restrictions on imports, important for China's accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and further liberalisation of access to foreign exchange. Last but not least, orthodox monetary policy will become the principal tool for management of the exchange rate, something the authorities must never forget. China is becoming a normal market economy. This means development of a market-oriented monetary system. But to be effective it must be backed up by fiscal reform and fiscal restraint. China's reforms always come in a higgledy-piggledy manner. This is another example. But it does mark a significant stage on the way to the market. China has a long way to go, but the direction remains clear, as does the stunning economic success that has attended its journey this far.</p>

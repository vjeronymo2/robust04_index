			<p>BFN     [Text] The Sudanese National Democratic Grouping yesterday  denounced the Khartoum government's seizure of Egyptian property  and new acts of aggression against Egyptians residing in Sudan  that threaten the brotherly ties between the two nations.    Faruq Abu-'Isa, chairman of the Higher Coordination  Committee, has confirmed the Sudanese people's intention to  liquidate the current regime in Khartoum to restore democracy to  Sudan.    Elsewhere, the Sudanese Foreign Ministry yesterday  reiterated  its claims that Egypt has no right to protest the confiscation  of its property in Sudan. An official at the ministry, Anwar  al-Hadi, said the lease contracts of the confiscated buildings  had expired and that the property had been handed over to the  Sudanese Government.</p>

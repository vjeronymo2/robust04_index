			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Gore fights for Nafta as Congress vote nears: Perot attacks trade pact in ill-tempered TV clash US vice-president Al Gore said early today that the North American Free Trade Agreement would create 'hundreds of thousands' of jobs in the US but if it did not work the pact could be ended by giving six months' notice. Mr Gore strongly defended the Nafta pact with Mexico and Canada during a TV debate, marked by testy exchanges, with Mr Ross Perot, the Texan billionaire who ran as an independent candidate in last year's presidential elections. Mr Perot is one of the most strident opponents of the free trade pact, which faces a crucial vote in the House of Representatives next Wednesday. Answering Mr Perot's charges that jobs would be lost to Mexico, Mr Gore said that 22 out of 23 studies had shown that Nafta would create more jobs in the US. 'We know this works. If it doesn't work, we give six months notice and we are out of it,' Mr Gore said. President Bill Clinton's Democratic administration is pushing hard for congressional endorsement of Nafta, which would create a free-trade zone of more than 370m people. Mr Clinton negotiated environmental and labour protection safeguards to add to the basic pact negotiated by his Republican predecessor, Mr George Bush. But even so, labour unions and environmentalists fear the pact will shift US jobs abroad and cause ecological damage, especially in border regions. The TV confrontation was marked by frequent interruptions and sharp attacks by each participant on the other's personal integrity. Mr Gore said that opponents of the Nafta were confusing 'the bad trade deals in the past with this one, which is the first time we've been able to get one that's even steven.' Mr Perot retorted by arguing for a 'social tariff' to be imposed on Mexican goods because of the much lower standard of living of Mexican workers. 'Livestock in this country and animals have a better life than good decent Mexican workers,' the acerbic millionaire said. The administration's efforts to build support for Nafta ahead of the House vote appeared to be bearing fruit yesterday as half a dozen wavering Democrats announced their support for the pact. In a further move, the Ways and Means committee, which controls tax and trade legislation, passed the bill implementing the trade agreement by a surprisingly wide margin of 25-12.

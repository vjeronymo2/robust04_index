			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 30 KYODO -- The ruling coalition on  Wednesday decided to hold a fence-mending meeting of top  officials in early April to repair strained relations among the  partners after calling off a scheme for creating a new party,  coalition sources said Wednesday. Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa's plan to establish a policy study group of coalition  legislators as the launching pad for a new party was shelved  after the scheme threatened to topple the fractious coalition.    Policy-making executives of the coalition partners set a  meeting of representatives on Monday for improving soured  relations among the coalition partners after the plan drew  criticism from two of the seven ruling parties, the Social  Democratic Party [SDP] and new party Sakigake [Harbinger].    The plan was being ambitiously pursued by Hosokawa, along  with the coalition's two strategists Ichiro Ozawa, secretary  general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], and Yuichi Ichikawa,  secretary general of the Buddhist-backed Komeito [Clean  Government Party].    The study group would have set the stage for merging the  seven coalition parties into a single party with possible  participation by some members of the opposition Liberal  Democratic Party. The coalition partners who had pushed for the  plan pointed the need for closer policy coordination among the  members.    Ichikawa, speaking at a meeting of Komeito legislators  Wednesday, said, "There still remains the need to enhance the  sense of policy unification among the coalition partners."  "There will be no cooperation over elections without unity on  policy," he said.    Shinseito's deputy secretary general, Kozo Watanabe, who  spoke at a meeting of party executives the same day, called for  a grouping that everybody can join freely. "We need to  cooperate toward creating a united party," he said.    Takashi Yonezawa, general secretary of the Democratic  Socialist Party (DSP), also a coalition partner, joined the  chorus of calls for continued efforts toward creating a new  party.    Yonezawa said the DSP should play an active role along with  Hosokawa's Japan New Party and Sakigake in establishing a forum  for discussing policy coordination in view of fielding joint  candidates in coming national elections under the new election  system.    The move toward a new party was accelerated after Hosokawa  pushed through a political reform package in January, replacing  multi-seat districts with single-seat constituencies in general  election for the House of Representatives.    But the initiatives by Hosokawa, Ozawa and Ichikawa have met  strong antagonism from the SDP, the largest bloc in the  coalition, and new party Sakigake led by Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi Takemura.    Koken Nosaka, chairman of the SDP's Diet Affairs Committee,  said at the meeting of top coalition officials that making  participation in the proposed study group preconditioned on  supporting joint coalition candidates for elections could lead  to a split in the coalition.    Meanwhile, Toshio Yamaguchi, an independent member of the  House of Representatives, who has been a major proponent for the  scheme, said at a press conference that the plan for an  interparty study group is still alive. He said he wants to  start a preparatory committee for the group by the end of April.    But a senior Komeito member said, "The situation is already  beyond the power of Mr. Yamaguchi."</p>

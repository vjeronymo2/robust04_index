			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Wilson (Connolly) falls 38% THE SHARE price of Wilson (Connolly) rose 3p to 163p yesterday, despite the announcement of a 38 per cent fall in pre-tax profit by the UK housebuilder and property developer and contractor. The decline in profits from Pounds 27.1m to Pounds 16.8m for 1992 was struck after increased provisions of Pounds 5.49m (Pounds 2.02m). A final dividend of 2.66p maintains the total at 3.93p. Earnings fell from 10.2p to 6.1p. Mr Ian Black, managing director, said the dividend was 1.5 times covered by post-tax profits. 'This was no mean feat in the longest and deepest recession in living memory.' Trading profits, before write- downs, fell 23 per cent to Pounds 22.3m (Pounds 29.1m) despite a record 2,880 homes being sold. Housing profits tumbled 29 per cent to Pounds 18.3m (Pounds 25.7m). Profit margins fell to 12 per cent reflecting price reductions of about 8 per cent. The company, like other housebuilders, had seen sales increase during the past few months. At the year-end the company had 13,300 building plots at an average price of just Pounds 12,600 each. Gearing of only 1 per cent meant the company was well placed to take advantage of an upturn in the market. Construction fell from Pounds 3.03m to Pounds 1.09m, on static sales of Pounds 36m. Commercial property surged from Pounds 380,000 to Pounds 2.9m. COMMENT Bowden and Bryant have produced the best results in the current housebuilding reporting season. They share long land banks supported by strong balance sheets and appear to have chosen the right time to expand output, with net reservations of housebuilders rising by between a fifth and a quarter during the first three months of this year compared with 1992. These virtues, however, have already been recognised in the companies' share performance and it is difficult to justify a buy recommendation on a prospective p/e, in Wilson Connolly's case, of 18 to 19 on prospective profits this year of Pounds 22m-Pounds 24m.</p>

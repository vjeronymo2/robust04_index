			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOORPARK;  </P> <P> BOARD SEEKS BAN ON ALL HATS AT SCHOOL  </P> <P> Concerned that banning certain colored hats discriminates against Hispanic  youths, the Moorpark Board of Education proposed a district policy to ban all  hats at district schools.  </P> <P> A rancorous school board discussion on the current dress code Tuesday night  lasted more than three hours and ended with a direction to Supt.  </P> <P> Tom Duffy to develop a policy, approved by the district's legal counsel, that  bans all hats, not just black, dark blue or red hats often worn by gang  members.  </P> <P> After hearing a presentation on the dress code, which has been in effect since  the beginning of the fall semester and was formulated because of several  gang-related incidents aimed at Moorpark High School students, board member Pam  Castro said she wished there had been more sensitivity regarding the dress  code.  </P> <P> "This is a focus on Hispanics . . . a change of tradition that shows an  insensitivity," she said.  </P> <P> Castro added that many of the youths who hang around together "have been  friends from day one. I think we should congratulate these kids who wear these  hats and who maintain a low crime rate in Moorpark," she said.  </P> <P> Moorpark High Principal Cary Dritz said that the policy is not discriminatory  and that no disciplinary action has been taken against any student because the  it.  </P> <P> The board directed Dritz to continue the policy but to make sure there was no  discrimination involved and to ask for more input from students.

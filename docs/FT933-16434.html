			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Recovery continues at Asda - Chief executive warns of difficult future for grocery market ASDA, the UK's fourth-largest grocery chain, continued its recovery with pre-tax profits for the year to May 1 of Pounds 187.4m, after a Pounds 364.8m loss last year, but warned that the grocery market faced an increasingly difficult future. Asda's shares fell 6p to 65 1/2 p, and share prices fell across the food retail sector as Mr Archie Norman, chief executive, said food retail growth was in decline, industry overcapacity was increasing, and competition was growing from cut-price discount operators. 'We are planning on the basis that the halcyon days in the UK grocery industry in terms of profitability are over,' he said. '1991 will turn out to have been the annus mirabilis of UK grocery retailing. The superstore industry will not be able to sustain the number of new openings planned without having some effect on margins and sales growth.' He added that Asda's achievement this year had been to improve its performance in difficult circumstances and that the chain's renewed emphasis on keen pricing made it well-placed to withstand the pressures on the grocery industry. The pre-tax figure, prepared under FRS 3, included exceptional credits of Pounds 65.2m. There were profits on asset sales of Pounds 97.8m offset by a Pounds 6m provision for restructuring the Allied Maples furnishing business, which made a Pounds 7.9m operating loss last year, and a Pounds 26.6m provision for losses on discontinued businesses, including the closure costs of Asda's food processing plant in Wakefield. Last year there was an exceptional charge of Pounds 451.6m. On a non-FRS 3 basis, profits before tax and exceptional items increased 62 per cent to Pounds 140.4m (Pounds 86.8m). That was at the top end of City forecasts, and in excess of Asda's own forecast of Pounds 130m when it launched a Pounds 347m rights issue in February. Group turnover improved to Pounds 4.61bn (Pounds 4.53bn). Turnover for the Asda stores improved 2 per cent to Pounds 4.4bn (Pounds 4.31bn for a 53-week year). On a 52-week basis, store turnover was up 4 per cent. Stripping out the effects of four new stores, four conversions to the new Dales discount format, and food price inflation of about 1 per cent, like-for-like sales growth was about 2 per cent, better than that achieved by Sainsbury, Safeway or Tesco. FRS 3 earnings per share were 6.4p (17.55p losses), and the proposed final dividend is 1.1p, making a total of 1.6p (2.1p). See Lex</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Heron repays Pounds 150m early Heron International, Mr Gerald Ronson's private property and trading group which finalised a Pounds 1.2bn debt restructuring in September, has repaid Pounds 150m of debt early, writes Maggie Urry. The payment, made by Heron Corporation, was due on March 31 next year and Pounds 25m of it had been repaid by September. The payment was made largely from disposals of properties which have been sold at values higher than those ascribed to them in the refinancing plan. Heron cut its debt in the restructuring through a swap of some loans into equity. The next debt repayment is Pounds 160m March 1995.</p>

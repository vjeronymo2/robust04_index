			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Moscow calls for uprising The Russian government yesterday issued a veiled call for the people of Chechnya - a Russian republic in the North Caucasus - to rise against their president, General Dzhokar Dudayev. It accused him of the murder of hundreds of opponents and of destabilising the whole of the North Caucasus. The statement comes after a week of rising tension between Moscow and the republican government and after hostages seized by Chechen terrorists were freed with the loss of 10 lives. The statement also warns of Russian intervention 'if violence is used against Russian citizens'. It says Chechnya has become the base for organised criminal groups. Opposition forces in the republic, with clear Russian backing, have also in the past week called for an uprising against the Dudayev regime.</p>

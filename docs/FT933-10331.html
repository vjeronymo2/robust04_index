			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: NatWest pleases The banking sector moved ahead as interim results from National Westminster, the high street bank, delighted the market and prompted a spate of forecast upgrades from analysts yesterday. NatWest shares jumped 13 to 510p and were among the most actively traded of the day, with turnover of 11m. Headline half-year profits came in at Pounds 421m, almost double the figure for the first half of last year and well above most expectations. Most of the rise was the result of the first fall in provisions for bad debts in three years. Analysts moved end of year forecasts higher, with SG Warburg raising its estimate by Pounds 130m to Pounds 980m and Smith New Court moving to Pounds 1.1bn from Pounds 875m for the year ending in December. Banking analysts said the 6.4p dividend was better than expected and the capital ratio was good but described the results as mixed. They said the drop in provisions was a one-off bonus and there were doubts over the underlying trading position. However, the general sentiment over a possible turnround in the fortunes of the banking sector prompted gains across the board. HSBC, whose subsidiary Midland is reporting today, advanced 14 to 671p in the ordinary stock and Barclays, which reports tomorrow, moved ahead 13 to 499p.</p>

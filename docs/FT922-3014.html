			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Gardening: Lost paradise blooms anew - Arthur Hellyer looks at an ambitious restoration project in Cornwall THE BRAVEST attempt at garden reclamation being undertaken in Britain must be the Heligan Manor project near Mevagissey, Cornwall. There was a time when Heligan was one of the most admired gardens in that area. A garden of some kind existed there as early as 1603. By 1735 it had been expanded, and by 1839 the outlines of the present garden largely were complete. It was to the the map of that year that a team of restorers turned to discover this pattern and, in particular, the position of the paths, which were buried beneath 18 in of soil. When they dug where the map indicated the paths should be, they discovered them virtually intact - but, before I continue, I must explain how a garden of this importance came to get into this kind of condition. Heligan always has belonged to the Tremayne family and still is part of its estate. But no member of the family has lived in it for years and the house, which is in excellent condition, is let as flats. I visited Heligan in 1950 when it was let to one tenant who is said to have expected that, because of the exceptional quality of its rhododendrons, it would be given the status of a national monument. Nothing of that sort ever happened. The rhododendrons certainly were remarkable but much of the garden was overgrown already. In the mid-1960s, a note in the Royal Horticultural Society's journal said the garden was to be bulldozed and that anyone could take cuttings of surviving plants. Again, nothing of the kind happened and the garden simply sank deeper into decay with a vast overgrowth of laurels, brambles and weeds that choked it. It was said that Heligan garden was finished and could never be reclaimed. Tim Smit had other ideas. He is a Dutch archaeologist who worked in the London music publishing market and then transferred his energy to Heligan. He persuaded some of his friends that his ideas were not entirely mad - and, more important, he also convinced those with money and influence, including Cornwall county council, to back him. In March 1991 he acquired a lease of the garden and started work. This spring, I was able to walk with Smit around the grounds to see and photograph his marvellous plants and even to penetrate a little way into a second garden of about equal size, a little distance to the south in a well-watered valley. In Edwardian times this was laid out as a Japanese garden, but it is now known as the tropical garden because of its luxuriance and its bamboos, tree ferns and many other sub-tropical plants. What made Heligan so special was that it was one of the first gardens to receive seeds and seedlings from the Joseph Dalton Hooker expedition of 1948-49 to Sikkim and the outskirts of Tibet. Some of the very oldest specimens of rhododendron arboreum are at Heligan, and there is a gigantic bush of R. Cornish Red which measures 82 ft from root to tip. Growth there is much more luxuriant than in the Himalayas. I saw very fine bushes of purple R. niveum and photographed flowers of the original blood-red R. arboreum, now very scarce in cultivation. This is, however, much more than a rhododendron garden and it is not even of these opulent shrubs that Smit and his colleagues dream most vividly. There was - and, surprisingly, still is - a great collection of fine trees and shrubs there, including camellias and some of the original plants of cornus capitata which once formed an avenue in the main drive but which now are reduced to just a few plants. Arrangements have been made with a skilled propagator to increase stock of any of the plants still growing at Heligan, and also to raise plants that once were there but have been lost and are to be re-introduced. Even this is not the end of the dream - in fact, it is only the beginning. Most of all, Smit wants to resurrect the Georgian and Victorian buildings. These include the ancient glasshouses and the vinery that are among the earliest in England; the melon yard and the pineapple pits; the bee-bole, a shelter in which bee skeps were placed and protected suitably in winter; the old rockeries; the wishing well and the dipping pool; the cut flower garden, and a great many other old features. Already this remarkable garden is open to the public seven days a week. The going is rough and I would not recommend it for the disabled, but it makes fascinating viewing for those who are reasonably able-bodied.</p>

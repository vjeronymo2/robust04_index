Addressing a news conference after meeting visiting Dutch  Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers and a day before crucial talks with  Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Mr Mandela  repeated he will press ahead with efforts to bring boycotters  into the election process. But he made it clear that his crusade  would rest on two main considerations.    "That the date set for the elections will under no  circumstances be postponed and secondly that... the sovereignty  of South Africa as a united nation must under no circumstances  be violated."    Mr Mandela was apparently referring to demands for  self-determinatioon and for a volkstaat [homeland] by the  Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and rightwing political groups. The  IFP is also reported to to have started moves for the election  to be postponed in kwaZulu/Natal.    "Within that framework I am prepared to spend the rest of my  days in an attempt to persuade every South African leader to  join us," Mr Mandela said.    Asked whether he was optimistic about his meeting with Mr  Buthelezi on Tuesday, Mr Mandela said dialogue was the ANC's  weapon which it would employ to sway groups bent on shuning the  process. "I approach every problem with optimism, because  dialogue is one of the most important weapons that we command,"  he said after meeting Mr Lubbers.    Touching on political violence, Mr Mandela said it was a  duty  of all South Africans to address the issue of violence to create  a proper environment for investment. The violence was creating  conditions where it was difficult to predict the economic or  political situation.    The ANC leader also said his organsiation was making  progress  in talks with rightwing organisations. He did not elaborate, but  has repeatedly said in the past that the ANC will not cave in to  demands for a volkstaat.    Mr Lubbers said he hoped ties between South Africa and his  country, which gave the ANC substantial financial and moral  support during its 30 years of anti-partheid struggle, will be  closer in the future.    Mr Mandela said Holland was one of the countries to throw  their weight behind the ANC campaign "in the most difficult time  in our struggle".</p>

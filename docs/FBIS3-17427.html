"Accusing Moscow of forgetting the problem of the use of  liquid radioactive waste, the Primorye administration is seeking  to put psychological pressure on the Japanese and to get the  money from them as soon as possible," the diplomat said.    He said the statement was not a surprise for the Russian  Foreign Ministry. "The Primorye administration had made it  clear even before that it wants on its own to be able to handle  the money which the Japanese agreed to provide for the  construction of the liquid nuclear waste deposits and  reprocessing facilities," the diplomat said.    He noted particularly that negotiations with the Japanese on  the construction of nuclear waste deposits and facilities for  its reprocessing are going on "in a constructive way." "What  does not suit the Primorye administration then? -- Perhaps, only  the fact that the money will go not directly to it, but through  the center, i.e. through Moscow," the diplomat suggested.</p>

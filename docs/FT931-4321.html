			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / International Company News: Procordia lifts payout as earnings rise to SKr4.8bn PROCORDIA, the Swedish pharmaceutical and food group, lifted profits after financial items by 31 per cent to SKr4.86bn (Dollars 637m) in 1992, following strong contributions from its Kabi Pharmacia and United Brands units. The group is increasing its dividend to SKr3.55 per share from SKr3.15 after a performance which saw turnover rise 5 per cent to SKr40.09bn and earnings per share increase to SKr13.50 from SKr12.90. Procordia said discussions to buy a significant stake in the Italian pharmaceuticals group Erbamont from Montedison were continuing, and it expected the deal to be finalised soon. However, it did not significantly elaborate on its statement last month, when it first disclosed that talks were in progress. It is thought that the group will take majority control of Erbamont in a deal which would create one of Europe's largest drug companies. Privatisation of Procordia, originally planned for last year, has been delayed pending finalisation of the deal. Procordia's 1992 performance was distorted by extensive restructuring and sale and purchase activity. Income from continuing operations was SKr4.36bn, up 6 per cent on 1991. Kabi Pharmacia, the unit which would merge with Erbamont, increased 1992 profits to SKr2.65bn from SKr2.35bn. Turnover climbed 16 per cent to SKr13.36bn, reflecting the group's acquisition of Pierrel of Italy and Farmiberia, although Kabi's existing units boosted sales by 12 per cent. United Brands, Procordia's tobacco, matches and confectionery unit, was the other strong performer, with an 18 per cent increase in sales to SKr6.78bn and a 9 per cent rise in profits to SKr1.21bn.</p>

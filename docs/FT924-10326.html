			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / MI5 was told exports to Iraq 'were for military purposes' BRITISH intelligence was told in 1987 that equipment exported to Iraq by a UK machine-tool manufacturer was intended for military use and probably passed this information to other western security agencies, an intelligence officer said yesterday. Mrs Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister, may also have been given a contemporaneous report on the situation, an officer of MI5, the UK's internal security service, indicated to an Old Bailey court yesterday. The officer, hidden behind a screen, remained anonymous throughout the proceedings, but is the first member of the intelligence services to have given evidence in open court rather than in camera as in previous trials. Called 'witness B', he was visible only to the judge, jury and leading lawyers. Gaps in the screen through which he would have been seen by others were hastily covered with brown wrapping paper and tape. Giving evidence in the trial of three former Matrix Churchill directors, who are accused of breaching export regulations, the officer explained how he obtained information about the Iraqi defence procurement programme from Mr Mark Gutteridge, an employee of the machine tool manufacturer. The contacts, usually made in Coventry hotels, started at the end of 1986, with the MI5 officer seeking political, military and economic intelligence, he told Mr Geoffrey Robertson QC, for Mr Paul Henderson, one of the defendants. Individual Iraqis brought to his attention by Mr Gutteridge included Dr Safa al-Hobobi, a director of the Nassr arms factory in Iraq, Dr Fidel, an Iraqi intelligence officer, a Mr Anis Wadi and a Mr Hanna Jon. In October 1987, Mr Gutteridge told him that contracts being worked on by Matrix Churchill included computer software and cutting gear specifically designed for the production of shells and projectiles. 'Do you remember telling Mr Gutteridge that his report would be seen by the prime minister?' Mr Robertson asked. 'I may well have said that,' the officer replied. Earlier, the officer had said this kind of information would be passed on to MI6 and then, presumably, on to other western intelligence agencies. When Matrix Churchill had its export licence revoked by the Department of Trade and Industry, Mr Gutteridge had got upset. He had thought this was a consequence of the information he had given to MI5. The MI5 officer wrote in his personal notes that - 'with my nose growing ever larger' - he had persuaded Mr Gutteridge this had not been the case. Mr Henderson, Mr Trevor Abraham and Mr Peter Allen all deny breaching export controls by deceiving the DTI into thinking the exports were for civil rather than military use. The trial continues on Monday.</p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Eurotunnel creates new class of debt Eurotunnel is planning to raise around Pounds 650m from a new class of senior bank debt as part of its Pounds 1.3bn refinancing package. The company and its four leading banks, or agent banks, are holding meetings all over the world to win the requisite 90 per cent support of its 200 bank creditors for the refinancing. It hopes to have persuaded them by the middle of May, so that it can then launch a rights issue to raise between Pounds 600m and Pounds 700m of new equity. 'The indications are that enough banks will back the proposals', said a banker. 'But it's bound to be a close thing.' The rights issue cannot take place before the new bank finance has been raised. The final deadline for securing commitments from the banks to avoid a financial crisis is the beginning of June, according to senior bankers. Unlike the previous refinancing in 1990, when Eurotunnel's commercial loan facilities were increased from Pounds 5bn to Pounds 6.8bn, the banks are this time being offered a new class of debt. 'It has an enhanced security package and matures earlier', said a banker. In other words, the new debt would rank ahead of the existing bank loans in a winding-up. It is also scheduled to be repaid in approximately 10 years, compared with the 2010 repayment date of the existing debt. In a second difference from the 1990 refinancing, the company has recognised that it will not be able to persuade all its banks to contribute to the new loan. In particular, it believes that Japanese banks, who have to date contributed 23 per cent of its Pounds 6.8bn commercial loan facilities, do not have sufficient capital to fully participate in the new loan. So banks' participation in the new credit line will be at their discretion and not a fixed proportion of their existing exposure as was the case in 1990. A banker said if the existing syndicate of banks was unable to provide the required funds, the company would approach banks outside the syndicate, especially US banks, which are under-represented. Eurotunnel requires the new funds because of the late start of services through the Channel tunnel, which means it will take longer for it to generate cash to meet overheads and service its existing debt. At the moment, it is in breach of its loan covenants and is drawing funds under waivers from the banks. A 90 per cent majority of banks also has to agree to change covenants to 'cure the waivers', in the words of a banker, prior to the rights issue. If the refinancing is successfully completed, Eurotunnel will have raised Pounds 10bn in debt and equity since 1986, far more than has ever been raised for any private sector infrastructure project.</p>

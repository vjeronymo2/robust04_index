Ever since the Team Spirit exercise started, North Korea  demanded its suspension, defining it as "an offensive training  exercise intended for a Northward invasion," and put forward its  suspension as a precondition for the resolution of the nuclear  problem.    The ROK and the United States created an atmosphere  favorable  for enhancing North Korean nuclear transparency by accepting the  North Korean demand, although with conditions. [passage omitted  on nature, background of Team Spirit]    Since the Team Spirit exercise has been used as a  negotiating  card up to now, it is likely that North Korea will continually  put forward a demand for additional military concessions,  including the complete suspension of the Team Spirit, at  negotiations.    However, relevant military officials expressed their  position  that the Team Spirit exercise, which is one of three elements  supporting the ROK-U.S. joint defense system, in addition to the  U.S. Forces in the ROK and ROK-U.S. joint command system, should  no longer be the target for negotiations.    Thus, the military raised voices expressing concern about  the  possibility of Team Spirit, which is not related to the nuclear  issue, being delayed and becoming nothing but a name, due to the  North Korean delaying tactics.    In particular, the United States proposed that the Team  Spirit be conducted every other year on the pretext of reducing  security expenses and the scale of the exercise, including the  participating troops, be reduced. In view of this, the military  officials are worried that the United States may make additional  concessions pertaining to the Team Spirit exercise.    This being the case, the relevant military officials  maintain  that as long as North Korea continues an arms buildup, not  giving up its will for war, even after it abandons nuclear arms  development, alternative steps should be taken in a bid to  supplement the temporary suspension or reduction of Team Spirit  so that the ROK- U.S. joint defense system remains consolidated.</p>

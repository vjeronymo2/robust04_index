			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL;  </P> <P> OXNARD KEEPS VALLEY AT BAY, 67-64  </P> <P> Oxnard College took an early lead and held off a tenacious Valley team, 67-64,  Wednesday night in a Western State Conference men's basketball game at Valley.  </P> <P> Throughout, there was the feeling that behind sharpshooting guards Tory  Stephens and Joey Manliguis, Valley might snatch victory from the Condors'  talons.  </P> <P> But Oxnard guard Tony Stark hit both ends of a 1-and-1 with 8 seconds to play  to put away the Monarchs.  </P> <P> Stark had only 5 points before the clinching free throws.  </P> <P> The meat of Oxnard's offense was provided by Stark's backcourt mate, Mark  Price, who scored 22 points, mostly from outside.  </P> <P> Outside shooting was in vogue as Stephens and Manliguis combined for 36 points,  primarily on baskets from the perimeter.  </P> <P> Stephens began his assault late, however, making the Monarchs' first 12  second-half points. A stop-and-pop jump shot by Stephens with 5:34 to play gave  Valley its biggest lead, 56-53.  </P> <P> Unfortunately for the Monarchs, the lead was short-lived as Condor center Randy  Carter went to work inside.  </P> <P> Carter scored 7 of Oxnard's final 9 points, all in the lane.  </P> <P> Forward Paul Nunnery scored 20 points for Oxnard.

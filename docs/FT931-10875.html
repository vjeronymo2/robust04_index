			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Letter: Too much junk on the line Sir, We have been subjected to a spate of advertising on the advantages of Yellow Pages. I have checked one line in my office which appears in business directories. A rough count indicated a ratio of about 40 solicitation calls from insurance sales persons, office cleaners etc to one 'professional inquirer for our services'. Of the professional inquirers, only a very small proportion turned out to be fruitful. Given the time that dealing with such solicitation takes up, and the blockage of our telephone facilities, I suspect that appearing in Yellow Pages results in our losing money rather than gaining business. There are ways of controlling junk mail - is there any way of controlling junk telephone calls? Iain C Baillie, 20 Chester Street, London SW1X 7BL</p>

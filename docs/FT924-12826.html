			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Crashes, big and small FIVE years to the day after Black Monday, the 1987 stock market crash looks a much less awesome affair than it did at the time. The colour black, as applied to days of the week, has been somewhat devalued by subsequent events; the plunge in property values and the 1990s' slow-motion collapse in Japanese shares have made 1987 look like a sideshow. Yet the sheer speed of the 1987 market slide, in which equity prices across the world lost a quarter of their value in a day and a half, continues to fascinate. Looking back, it is easy to forget the climate of the time: this was a feel-good decade for investors. The Reagan administration brought a reassertion of American influence in the world, together with an overwhelming fiscal boost to the global economy. An ideological commitment to markets was gaining ground against the interventionist orthodoxy of previous years. Deregulation, privatisation and falling top marginal tax rates were a la mode. A protracted economic recovery was marked by a significant boost in profits in many countries. Commodity prices were weak. Yet the transformation from boom to bubble arose, as always, from monetary policy. Monetary conditions in the developed world became more relaxed in mid-decade. Then came the Louvre Accord in February 1987 and the co-operative attempt to prop up the dollar. The result was a flood of liquidity into the markets. British equities, for example, rose nearly 50 per cent in the 12 months before the crash. If any single event was responsible for changing market perceptions, it was the row between the US and Germany over monetary policy, which coincided with appalling US trade figures. It suddenly looked as though the US was about to embark on more restrictive policies. The speed of the subsequent market adjustment no doubt reflected the enormously increased importance of professional investors since 1929. But the more important point was that the markets were right. Within months it was clear that demand in the developed world had been accelerating at an unsustainable rate. Within a couple of years the economic gains of the decade looked less substantial. Increased consumption in the Anglo-Saxon economies had been financed by a run-down of household savings and an accumulation of debt. The US remained prey to a long-run productivity crisis. Japan, the world's second largest economy, had continued to invest at a rate appropriate to a developing country, to nugatory effect. Banks everywhere were fragile. Central bankers were unquestionably justified in pumping short-term liquidity into the markets and arm-twisting banks to stop calling in collateral as prices plunged. The mistake, most notably in Britain and Japan, was to keep monetary policy loose for too long after the event, thereby giving leverage a final fling. The wider message might be that markets are better at acknowledging their mistakes than ministers. The size of the present financial hangover bears eloquent testimony to that.</p>

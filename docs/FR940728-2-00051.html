			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. EPA Activities Related to Auditing Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is currently participating in two major non-regulatory efforts to develop voluntary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards for auditing and environmental management systems. First, the International  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Organization of Standards (ISO), based in Geneva, Switzerland, established in 1993 a Technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Committee for Environmental Management Standards (ISO&hyph;TC&hyph;207). Subcommittee Two of TC&hyph;207 is in the process of developing environmental auditing standards. The standards fall into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three groups: Auditing Principles, Auditing Procedures, and Auditor Qualifications. Second, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the U.S., the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) in Ann Arbor, Michigan, is developing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental auditing standards that are intended to be compatible with and augment the ISO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. Work is proceeding rapidly within ISO and NSF, with draft standards expected by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> end of the year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed NSF and ISO auditing standards are being developed within the framework  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of overall environmental management systems standards. Neither ISO nor NSF intends to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish specific environmental standards; instead both are seeking to provide management tools  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that include auditing schemes and standards. The EPA 1986 Policy has been a central reference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document for both the ISO and NSF work. As these new documents develop, issues of auditor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualifications and explicit management commitment to audit follow-up will be of particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest to EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IV. Review of EPA Policy on Specific Environmental Auditing Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Agency Requests for Audit Reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's 1986 Policy clearly states that: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> .&blank;.&blank;. EPA believes routine Agency requests for audit reports could inhibit auditing in the long  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> run, decreasing both the quantity and quality of audits conducted. Therefore, as a matter of policy EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not routinely request environmental audit reports. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1986 policy also acknowledges regulated entities' need to self-evaluate environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance with some measure of privacy. However, audit reports may not shield monitoring,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance or other information that would otherwise be reportable and/or accessible to EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> even if there is no explicit requirement to generate that data. Thus, the 1986 Policy does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alter regulated entities' existing or future obligations to monitor, record or report information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required under environmental statutes, regulations or permits, or to allow EPA access to that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information. Nor does the 1986 Policy alter EPA's authority to request and receive any relevant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information_including that contained in audit reports_under various environmental statutes or in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other administrative or judicial proceedings. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's authority to request an audit report, or relevant portions thereof, will be exercised on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a case-by-case basis where the Agency determines it is needed to accomplish a statutory mission, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where the Government deems it to be material to a criminal investigation. EPA expects such requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be limited, most likely focused on particular information needs rather than the entire report, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> usually made where the information needed cannot be obtained from monitoring, reporting, or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data otherwise available to the Agency. Examples would likely include situations where: audits are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted under consent decrees or other settlement agreements; a company has placed its management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practices at issue by raising them as a defense; or state of mind or intent are a relevant element of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inquiry, such as during a criminal investigation. This list is illustrative rather than exhaustive, since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there doubtless will be other situations, not subject to prediction, in which audit reports rather than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information may be required .&blank;.&blank;. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. EPA Response to Environmental Auditing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. General Policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1986 Policy states that ``EPA will not promise to forgo inspections, reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement responses, or offer other such incentives in exchange for implementation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental auditing or other sound environmental management practices.'' EPA is required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by law to independently assess compliance status of facilities, and cannot eliminate inspections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for particular firms or classes of firms. Certain statutes (e.g. RCRA) and Agency policies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish minimum facility inspection frequencies to which EPA will adhere. Environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audits are in no way a substitute for regulatory oversight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As explained in the 1986 Policy, however, EPA will take into account a facility's efforts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to audit in setting inspection priorities and in fashioning enforcement responses to violations: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> .&blank;.&blank;. EPA will continue to address environmental problems on a priority basis and will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequently inspect facilities with poor environmental records and practices more frequently. Since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective environmental auditing helps management identify and promptly correct actual or potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problems, audited facilities' environmental performance should improve. Thus, while EPA inspections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of self-audited facilities will continue, to the extent that compliance performance is considered in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> setting inspection priorities, facilities with a good compliance history may be subject to fewer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In fashioning enforcement responses to violations, EPA policy is to take into account, on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case-by-case basis, the honest and genuine efforts of regulated entities to avoid and promptly correct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violations and underlying environmental problems. When regulated entities take reasonable precautions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to avoid noncompliance, expeditiously correct underlying environmental problems discovered through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audits or other means, and implement measures to prevent their recurrence, EPA may exercise its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discretion to consider such actions as honest and genuine efforts to assure compliance. Such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration applies particularly when a regulated entity promptly reports violations or compliance data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that otherwise were not required to be recorded or reported to EPA. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These principles have been incorporated into the Agency's enforcement response and civil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty policies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Audit Provisions as Remedies in Enforcement Settlements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1986 Policy includes the following language on audit provisions as remedies in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement settlements: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA may propose environmental auditing provisions in consent decrees and in other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> settlement negotiations where auditing could provide a remedy for identified problems and reduce the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likelihood of similar problems recurring in the future. Environmental auditing provisions are most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likely to be proposed in settlement negotiations when:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A pattern of violations can be attributed, at least in part, to the absence or poor functioning of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental management system; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The type of nature of violations indicates a likelihood that similar noncompliance problems may exist  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or occur elsewhere in the facility or at other facilities operated by the regulated entity. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's enforcement office issued further guidance on this issue in 1986 in a document  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entitled ``EPA Policy on the Inclusion of Environmental Auditing Provisions in Enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Settlements.'' This guidance has been consistently applied in enforcement actions as appropriate,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and has formed the basis for the inclusion of audit agreements or provisions in numerous consent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decrees. Selected text from this document, also still in effect, is included here: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In recent years, Agency negotiators have achieved numerous settlements that require regulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entities to audit their operations. These innovative settlements have been highly successful in enabling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Agency to accomplish more effectively its primary mission, namely, to secure environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance. Indeed, auditing provisions in enforcement settlements have provided several important  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits to the Agency by enhancing its ability to: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Address compliance at an entire facility or at all facilities owned or operated by a party, rather  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than just the violations discovered during inspections; and identify and correct violations that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may have gone undetected (and uncorrected) otherwise;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Focus the attention of a regulated party's top-level management on environmental compliance;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produce corporate policies and procedures that enable a party to achieve and maintain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance; and help a party to manage pollution control affirmatively over time instead of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reacting to crises;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Provide a quality assurance check by verifying that existing environmental management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practices are in place, functioning and adequate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is the policy of EPA to settle its judicial and administrative enforcement cases only where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violators can assure the Agency that their noncompliance will be (or has been) corrected.

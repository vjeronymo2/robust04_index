			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday, the health workers and the government  reached an agreement by which the workers received a 12 percent  salary increase. Therefore, after solving their problem, the  health workers, about 600 of them, decided to lift the hunger  strike and left for home, happy after several days of fasting.    This agreement could create problems for the COB [Bolivian  Labor Federation] in view of the possibility that other sectors  may do the same, thus breaking up the united struggle. The COB  said, however, that this agreement will not weaken the workers'  struggle for their demands, which will again be negotiated.    Yesterday the government asked the COB to lift the coercive  measures. Today, after a COB assembly, a decision was made to  maintain the hunger strike and the indefinite strike of some  sectors, and to suspend the street demonstrations over the  entire country, starting this afternoon, until next Sunday when  the march celebrating Labor Day will be held.    [Begin COB Executive Secretary Oscar Salas recording] This  demonstration of flexibility, of political will shown by the COB  and the workers, should be responded to by the government  through new proposals which would serve as a basis for  discussion to reach a solution to the conflict. [end recording]    On 1 May, workers will concentrate in the Plaza San  Francisco  to start the march to celebrate Labor Day. And on 3 May, the  COB will hold a national assembly.    The government has, however, a different opinion of the  decision made by the COB. The government believes that all  coercive measures should be lifted to continue with the  negotiations tonight.    [Begin Communications Minister Ernesto Machicao recording]  The information I have about the COB's decision is still  unofficial in reference to the efforts made over the last few  days and weeks to have the coercive measures lifted. [end  recording]    We should remember that the COB said it would only stop the  street demonstrations, not the hungers strikes and the  indefinite strike. But despite this decision, the step taken by  the health workers is an important factor in the COB-government  negotiations.    [Begin Labor Minister Reynaldo Peters recording] The salary  increase granted to the health workers and the increase we are  studying for the teachers will be implemented thanks to the  savings made in each of these sectors. The salaries paid to  people who did not work but got paid as a result of corruption  will now be used for the salary increases in those sectors.  This will be one of the main proposals we will take today to  the COB. [end recording]    The COB, however, has not lost its hope of getting a higher  salary increase percentage.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Hakki Atun has stated that the  Turkish Cypriot side did its utmost regarding the proximity  talks on the confidence-building measures.    In a statement to BRT [Bayrak Radio and Television], Atun  recalled that the Turkish Cypriot side took chances by  displaying its goodwill when it accepted the package in  principle so that the talks would continue. Atun added,  however, that the advantages to the Turkish Cypriot side did not  materialize in the package. Indicating that the Greek Cypriots  changed the package to their favor, Atun said the Turkish  Cypriot side's requests and concerns are always disregarded.    Pointing out that the UN officials asked for other areas in  addition to Maras [Varosha], Atun stressed that it is out of  question to accept a package which is unacceptable to the  people, in which embargoes are not eased, and in which there are  no concrete gains for the Turkish Cypriot side.</p>

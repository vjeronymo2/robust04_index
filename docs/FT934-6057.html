			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / DTI case against four Polly Peck directors dismissed A high court judge has dismissed on lack of evidence attempts to bring disqualification proceedings against four directors of Polly Peck International, the collapsed fruit-to-electronics conglomerate. In transcripts of a hearing earlier this month Mr Justice Lindsay calls the case made against the directors 'at best speculative and very weak'. His ruling covers Mr David Fawcus, Polly Peck's finance director, Mr Mark Ellis, joint managing director in 1983-87, and Mr Lawrence Tindale and Mr Ulf Siebel, two non-executive directors. The judgment will prove an embarrassment to the Department of Trade and Industry, which was last month criticised in a National Audit Office report on the whole process of directors' disqualifications, including their administration. It appears to focus responsibility for alleged misconduct among directors solely on fugitive businessman Mr Asil Nadir, former chairman of Polly Peck facing charges totalling Pounds 34m for theft and false accounting. The DTI was requesting more time to bring disqualification proceedings beyond the normal statutory limit of two years following the insolvency of the company. But the judge said there had been delays in preparing the case that were 'unreasonable', and there was 'no good reason' for the extensions. He added that further delays would prejudice the directors under scrutiny. The DTI's case was based on statutory reports submitted on each of the directors made by Mr Christopher Morris, a partner with accountants Touche Ross and one of the joint administrators of Polly Peck. Most of the reports are believed to have been in general terms without specific evidence to justify disqualification. One referring to Mr Nadir was highly critical. The transcript shows the case was based on four charges related to inadequate financial controls, and failure to monitor or question spending in Polly Peck's Near East subsidiaries.</p>

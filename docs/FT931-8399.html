			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Arts: John Osborne's 'Luther' In a week of early 1960s London revivals, the one that stands out is John Osborne's Luther at the Hen and Chickens Theatre in Islington. Here is a very well-written, serious, intelligent piece that should not have been neglected for so long. The play was first performed at the Theatre Royal in Nottingham, then at the Royal Court in London, in 1961 when Osborne's reputation after Look Back in Anger and The Entertainer was at its height. Albert Finney played Luther. There was much discussion at the time of the apparent thesis that the dissident priest was influenced by trouble with his bowels: he was said to be an anal neurotic. Finney dominated the production. Today Luther looks a gentler, wiser, more thoughtful play, more about society as a whole than about one man's anger. Two thoroughly tenable propositions emerge. One is that by challenging the Catholic Church so savagely about its selling of indulgences, Luther set faction against faction in a way that benefited no-one. The other is that he was the founder of German power. As Staupitz, the Vicar General of the Augustinian Order, remarks of Luther's resistance to the ways of Rome: 'The world's changed. For one thing, you've made a thing called Germany; you've unlaced a language and taught it to the Germans, and the rest of the world will just have to get used to the sound of it . . . You've made the body of Europe . . . All I beg of you is not to be too violent.' There is no hostility in that comment, just an acceptance by Staupitz, played here as a genially wise old man by Patrick Godfrey, that Germany is on the way up and Italy is on the way down. Note, too, the use of the word 'unlaced'; not 'unleashed' or anything savage like that, just a gradual process of evolution from Latin to German. This is Osborne writing with precise language and a remarkable grasp of history. Ben Walden's Luther is on the whole a sympathetic figure: not because he is a rebel whom everyone outside the Catholic hierarchy knows is right, but because he evidently suffers from self-doubt. At the end he admits to Staupitz that he really was not sure whether his denunciations of the Church were fully justified. True, he suffers from constipation, but this is not central to the interpretation of the character. Walden's performance gains by not trying to take over the play. Some of the speeches are very long: there is very little of the customary Osborne knockabout. Yet here again is a tribute to his writing: he has mastered his material and there are fine distinctions of character both within the laity and the clergy. The one set-piece that might just remind you of The Entertainer is Tetzel, the Dominican Inquisitor cheerfully selling indulgences in the market square. The part is wonderfully played by David King. The production comes from the Operating Theatre Company directed by John Link. It is now managing the Hen and Chickens Theatre. The next stage in a pub theatre like this must be to improve the physical conditions. Stifling enough for the audience, they must be almost unbearable for the actors - particularly those in Luther wearing heavy clerical robes. Hen and Chickens, London N1 until March 13.

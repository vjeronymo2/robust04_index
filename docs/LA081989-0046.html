			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> HOUSTON FANS REMEMBER RYAN  </P> <P> Each time Nolan Ryan flirts with his sixth no-hitter or reaches another career  milestone, Houston Astros fans remember.  </P> <P> They remember that Ryan pitched his fifth no-hitter in the Astrodome and that  he became the all-time strikeout leader in an Astros uniform.  </P> <P> And they remember that when Ryan's contract expired last season, he initially  was offered a decrease in pay and later signed with the Texas Rangers.  </P> <P> Ryan, homegrown in nearby Alvin, pitched nine memorable seasons with the  Astros, helping them to two National League Western Division titles.  </P> <P> He wanted to end his career in the Astrodome.  </P> <P> But when Ryan records his 5,000th career strikeout, it will be with another  Texas team -- the Rangers.  </P> <P> And Astros fans remember.  </P> <P> "Everytime he does something outstanding, it's like re-opening an old wound,"  Astros fan Lyn Johnston of League City said. "It's like pouring a little more  salt on it."  </P> <P> Johnson said he's followed Ryan's career since he was a child and had  considered buying season tickets until Ryan's departure.  </P> <P> Now he sees nine or 10 games per season and still hears the bitterness over the  loss of Ryan, even though the Astros have been near the top of the NL's Western  Division all season.  </P> <P> "I think the Astros made a big mistake and by now I think (Astros owner John)  McMullen realizes it," Johnson said. "If there was any way I could be sitting  on the front row when he makes that 5,000th strikeout, I'd be there."  </P> <P> The Astros initially offered Ryan a contract worth $800,000 when his $1 million  per year deal expired last season.  </P> <P> When Ryan balked and started entertaining offers from other teams, a bidding  war ensued.  </P> <P> California owner Gene Autry offered $3.2 million over two years to get Ryan  back on the team where he pitched for eight seasons and San Francisco  reportedly offered a two-year package worth $3.2 million, $1.8 million of it  guaranteed.  </P> <P> But Ryan didn't want to leave his home state, and signed a 2-year contract with  the Rangers for $3.2 million. He is guaranteed $2 million this season.  </P> <P> The Astros finally made Ryan a one-year offer of $1.3 million with no  incentives or bonus.  </P> <P> "Stupid, that's all you can call it," said Ben Young of San Antonio. "Even if  he wasn't pitching as well as he once did, you don't let someone like a Hall of  Famer get away. It was sad to see him go."  </P> <P> Ryan's Astros teammates were as unhappy as the fans and now track his successes  with the Rangers.  </P> <P> "I keep up with him the best I can," Astros second baseman Bill Doran said.  "Everyone in the Astros organization wish nothing but the best for him."  </P> <P> Ryan's success with the Rangers is a touchy subject with Astros management,  keenly aware of their unpopular decision.  </P> <P> "I'm not surprised at what he is doing," Astros general manager Bill Wood said.  "We never purported in any way, shape or form that the man couldn't pitch.  Ours' was a business disagreement."  </P> <P> Owner McMullen won't discuss the subject.  </P> <P> Art Howe, in his first season as Astros manager and a former teammate of  Ryan's, never got a chance to pencil him into the starting rotation.  </P> <P> The Astros signed free agents Jim Clancy and Rick Rhoden to fill the void.  Rhoden spent almost three months on the disabled list and Clancy has been  ineffective much of the season.  </P> <P> Despite a season of pitching injuries, Howe says he doesn't consider the  possibility of Ryan in his rotation.  </P> <P> "That never crosses my mind, besides, you can't say he would be doing the same  thing here," Howe said. "He went over there with something to prove and he's  doing it.  </P> <P> "I'm just happy for the Rangers because they are my former team. I'm happy for  Nolan, too. He'll get the 5,000."  </P> <P> Cincinnati manager Pete Rose, who hit and managed against Ryan, also is happy,  happy that Ryan is in the American League.  </P> <P> "He's a physical freak," Rose said admiringly. "It's a credit to how well he  takes care of himself in the off season.  </P> <P> "I get a kick out of guys who say he shouldn't be in the Hall of Fame. If Nolan  Ryan isn't in the Hall of Fame, there shouldn't be a Cooperstown.  </P> <P> "People who say he doesn't belong there are the same people who wouldn't put  syrup on their ice cream."  </P></p>

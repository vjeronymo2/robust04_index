			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [All quotation marks as published] </F>   [Text] Two handwritten letters issued by Shining Path  militants have been delivered to LA REPUBLICA. The letters,  within the context of the bloody and fateful subversive war that  bled our country for more than 13 years, could lead to a new  stage filled with grave and daunting consequences.    One of the clandestine or confidential documents is signed  --  in the way pamphlets, pronouncements, or declaration are usually  done -- by the "Prisoners of war of the Canto Grande Luminous  Combat Trench [LTC]."    The other document is a letter addressed by the captured  Edmundo Daniel Cox Beuzeville (sentenced to life imprisonment)  to a colonel.    Both documents stress "the ironclad and unconditional  subordination to the party leadership" undoubtedly represented  by Abimael Guzman Reynoso, whom they call "President Gonzalo."    The letters also express their indubitable support to the  letters signed by "President Gonzalo" and "Comrade Miriam" and  their request to President Alberto Fujimori for "a peace  agreement."    The new and worrying aspect of these two letters is that  together with the deceiving call for a "peace agreement" there  is a call for a Shining Path "second congress."    In other words, the terrorist organization does not lay down  its arms or surrender. It accepts talks or negotiations with the  government leading to "a peace agreement" and conspires while  getting reorganized through a call for a new congress.    There is another new element in these documents, the  implications of which, without a doubt, deserve a broad national  debate in light of official reports:    The Canto Grande inmates and Cox Beuzeville at no time  mention the much publicized "internal war between Shining Path  followers." (There is no separation of responsibilities with  "Comrade Feliciano").    The fourth paragraph of the Canto Grande document, moreover,  mentions a "black campaign by opportunists and revisionists,"  followed by threatening remarks.    The Shining Path has usually used these adjectives to refer  to leftist political parties, labor organizations, and even to  nongovernmental organizations (ONG).    But what is worse, they have not only characterized them as  opportunists and revisionists and threatened them. They also  have used this type of verbal virulence to justify their  cowardly and absurd crimes against these organizations' leaders  and social workers.    There are, therefore, many answers and many explanations  behind this disturbing and grim strategy of letters.    One of the explanations, for instance, must refer in very  concrete terms to the revelation made by Cox Beuzeville that he  has been allowed to leave prison, where he is serving a life  sentence, to carry out "works" on behalf of pacification.    [First letter]    "Struggle for a peace agreement and establishment of the  basis for the second congress.    "We, the fighting Communists and the masses of the Canto  Grande Luminous Combat Trench, undeclinably accepting President  Gonzalo's leadership in this historic and great test, reiterate  our decision not to take a single step without President  Gonzalo's personal approval for we are fully convinced that he  is the greatest Marxist-Leninist-Maoist living on earth, and  just as he lead us in the past he will lead us again today,  tomorrow, and forever until we reach our objective, the much  coveted Communism."    "It is convenient to stop for a minute in this paragraph. It  is an organic statement, a statement of ideological  ratification. It is an act of subordination to Abimael's  personal leadership.    "We also salute and support the new strategic course  established by him, unshakably sure that the proletarian  leadership is decisive for victory. Even more so in these  circumstances of new, complex, and difficult problems for our  party, the people's war, the Peruvian revolution, and the world  proletarian revolution."    This is a new course for Peruvian revolution.    "The fighting Communists and masses, closing ranks with  President Gonzalo and the Central Leadership, firmly,  decisively, and tenaciously support the call made by our  leadership and Comrade Miriam to struggle for a peace agreement  and establish the basis for the Second Congress, putting into  practice the unavoidable task of Assuming and Struggle for the  New Great Decision and Definition as Communists, Maoists, and  soldiers of the proletariat, with deep revolutionary happiness  and optimism, and committing ourselves to make Canto Grande a  forward station of this new stage."    Establish the basis for the Second Shining Path Congress.    "With the deepest class hate, we totally and resolutely  repudiate and condemn the sinister black campaign against  President Gonzalo and Comrade Miriam, the essence of which is to  cunningly oppose the Peace Agreement. Those who always attacked  us furiously have once more unleashed their infamy with even  more audaciousness. Today more than ever they are moved by  egotist electoral ambitions and political appetites. They are  the usual opportunists, revisionists, and lackeys who again show  their persistent opposition to the true interests of the deep  masses and the people."    It is not against the traditional parties, the legal left,  labor leaders, or the ONG's.    "Assume with firmness and accelerated willingness this New  Great Decision and Definition because it serves the interests of  proletarians and the people, hoisting as high as possible the  always red flags of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism and Gonzalo's  thoughts, our specific and main weapon."    "Close lines around President Gonzalo and the Central  Leadership!"    "Raise the flag of the New Great Decision and Definition!"    "Struggle for a Peace Agreement and establish the basis for  the Second Congress!"    "Glory to Marxism-Leninism-Maoism!"    "Lima, December 1993."    "Prisoners of War of the Campo Grande LTC."    [Second Letter]    "Colonel Savino Cayahuanca Farro"    "Director of E.P.R.E.M.C.C." [expansion unknown]    "Request of personal audience with the director."    "Mister Director."    "I come to you Mr. Colonel director of this EPREMCC to  request a personal audience, which I have repeatedly asked  through the official authorities of diverse services as of 10  December 1993, the date I returned from my latest exit from this  prison, as you know. The purpose of the audience will be to  discuss directly with you some necessary and important questions  referring to what we agreed upon in other instances on the  development of the works and meetings in favor of a successful  end of the negotiation for a peace agreement. It is true, Mr.  Colonel, that these tasks are not easy or simple. The struggle  for a peace agreement is complex, difficult, and risky, and  involves the difficulties proper of something new!"    "Ever since the first time you were so kind to receive me I  clearly told you, sharply and explicitly, my firm and decisive  agreement, voluntary support, conscious identification, and full  adherence to President Gonzalo and Comrade Miriam's letters,  published and disseminated by President Alberto Fujimori. My  commitment is, therefore, full, total, unconditional, public,  decisive, and defined for the course of realizing what today has  become a need for all: the Peace Agreement. In this way,  `Peace, everyone's task,' as you rightfully ordered painted at  the entrance, should be the slogan permitting everyone to  cooperate in this praiseworthy objective. This cooperation  should have necessary flexibility, within current laws,  regulations, and discipline in effect in this prison, which is  an undeniable fact that is part of this government's success and  your personal merit."    "I reiterate to you, sir, my willingness to discuss all  problems that might come up and solve them favorably and in  accordance with the Peace Agreement. This is a norm of behavior  I adopted ever since I entered this prison, within the framework  of mutual respect, and in an attempt to serve the objective of  our national reconciliation without winners or losers: making  more visible and comfortable our relations between authorities  and inmates."    "I beg of you Mr. Director, to attend to this request and  agree to it."    "EPREMCC, 3 January 1994"    "Edmundo Daniel Cox Beuzeville"</p>

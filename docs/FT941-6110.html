			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): On the prowl for copycats - The battle to stop retailers from selling products identical to famous brands Consumer goods manufacturers in the UK are fighting to stop retailers selling own-label products that look almost identical to well-known brands. A dozen of the biggest names have formed the British Producers and Brand Owners Group to press for a change in the law - which they say lags far behind those in other European countries when it comes to protecting their products from 'copycat' competition by retailers. Members include Allied Lyons, Gillette, Guinness, Grand Met, ICI Paints, Kellogg, Mars, Nestle, Procter &amp; Gamble, SmithKline Beecham and Unilever. They say own-label products are being designed deliberatley to resemble manufacturers' brands - using similar bottles or packs, colours and typography, even similar names. But while manufacturers spend millions of pounds on research, development and marketing of brands, it costs retailers very little to copy them. The issue, says Michael Mackenzie, director-general of the Food and Drink Federation, which represents manufacturers, is not so much that consumers might mistake the own-label product for the manufacturer's brand. Rather, look-alike brands may 'give the impression that the manufacturer of the proprietary brand has made the own-label product'. Brand manufacturers may have contributed to the confusion in the past by actually making own-label products for supermarkets, but most no longer do so. Kellogg recently ran an advertising campaign based on the fact that it does not make cereal for anyone else. While the big names believe the problem has worsened, they have nevertheless been reluctant to speak out. This is because their relations with retailers are delicate. 'The worst thing you can do is to pick a fight with your biggest customers,' says Mackenzie. 'But the customers are giving them no option.' What has prompted manufacturers to move now is the prospect of changing the law through the government's Trade Marks Bill, which was introduced first into the House of Lords and reached the report stage last week. It will get its third reading in about 10 days' time. The bill is designed to harmonise UK laws on unfair competition with those in other EU countries, based on the Paris Convention on intellectual property. It aims to make it easier to register trade marks, as well as certain shapes, words and logos on packaging. But manufacturers say it does not go far enough. They want protection against look-alike brands which imitate the overall appearance of their own brands, without directly copying logos or designs. Lord Reay last week introduced an amendment on behalf of the brand owners group extending such protection. After a debate in the Lords last Thursday, Lord Reay withdrew his amendment when the government promised to review the issue, but the group may re-introduce its amendment if the government does not act during the passage of the bill. Paul Walsh, partner at Bristows, Cooke &amp; Carpmael, a law firm specialising in intellectual property, says the UK is out of line with most of Europe in not giving brands proper statutory protection. Germany has a statute on 'protection of get-up', and there are similar laws in France, Benelux and Greece. The problem of look-alikes is particularly sensitive in the UK because supermarkets have worked hard to change consumers' perceptions of own-label products from inferior imitations to quality alternatives. Retailers make much higher margins on own-label products because they do not bear the same development costs as manufacturers. The big three UK grocers - Sainsbury's, Safeway and Tesco - have pushed own-label sales to more than 50 per cent of turnover, far higher than elsewhere in Europe. But opponents of the amendment argue that the bill as it stands, coupled with existing safeguards, is adequate. The British Retail Consortium, which represents more than 200 retailers, says manufacturers are attempting to restrict shops' ability to introduce own-label products. 'Shoppers are not confused,' the consortium said. 'They are very canny and read the label carefully.' The Consumers Association found in a survey last month that shoppers showed a preference for many own-label products in blind tastings. It warns that tighter restrictions on own-label products could lead to narrower choice for consumers.</p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Black moves to limit fears on price war Mr Conrad Black, chairman of The Telegraph group, said yesterday he hoped the drop in profits resulting from the cut in the cover price of The Daily Telegraph to 30p would be limited to no more than Pounds 5m to Pounds 10m in a full year. The company has conceded that the cut from 48p to 30p in the price of the weekday Daily Telegraph to attack the cut-price Times, now at 20p, will cost Pounds 40m gross in a full year - an admission that led last week to a sharp fall in The Telegraph share price. Mr Black said yesterday he believed as much as Pounds 25m of that could be regained from extra revenue, reduction in tax and cost-cutting at The Daily Telegraph, which saw its circulation fall below 1m in April for the first time in more than 40 years. The company, he said, is also likely to benefit from normal growth in the company's subsidiaries in Canada and Australia. 'It's not progress but we can live with that,' he said. Sales of The Daily Telegraph have already started to rise since last week's price cut, according to Mr Black. 'The Telegraph was up 90,000 on Friday,' he said. Mr Black believes that the very steep fall in his share price from the 587p at which Hollinger sold 12.5m Telegraph shares on May 19 to institutions to Friday's closing price of 332p was a 'ludicrous overaction' by the City. He said if the share price did not rise when there was evidence of increasing sales and reduced costs he would be happy to buy the shares back himself. Mr Black yesterday thought two of the three main accusations against him had fallen away. One was the 'legal-ethical question' over the May share sale. The Stock Exchange ruled on Friday that there was no connection between the sale of the shares and the announcement of the price cut. The second accusation Mr Black believes he faces is that he is a co-predator with Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of The News Corporation. A front page editorial in The Independent on Saturday, signed by Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, the paper's editor, said: 'Two right-wing ideologues, Rupert Murdoch and Conrad Black, have set about destroying the quality newspaper market.' Mr Black said that for taking action to counter the Murdoch price-cutting campaign 'Andreas Whittam Smith should embrace me as a brother'. It is too early to know if the third accusation - that Mr Black has simply got it wrong and thrown away millions of pounds - is correct. 'If I have got it wrong I will acknowledge the error publicly. If a policy is mistaken then we must find another,' he conceded. None of the other national newspaper groups is expected to join the price war, although The Independent is likely to drop to 45p before long to correct what is now seen as a mistaken policy last year to increase the price to 50p.</p>

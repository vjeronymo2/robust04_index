			<p>CSO     [Text] The Agency of Industrial Science and Technology  (AIST) began examining partial revision of the method of  allocating research funds; namely, the addition of the "reward  type" funding method, aimed at rewarding original ideas and  results produced during the course of experiments, to the  existing "budget type" allocation method, which is designed to  fund projects only with clearly defined goals. Since R&amp;D  projects, funded by the budget type method, cannot fail, they  will have to select themes which are risk-free, namely,  extensions of the existing technologies. Projects which are  supported by the reward-type funding, on the other hand, can  take risks, thereby producing totally unexpected results.  However, since incorporating this new method of funding into the  existing budget-based accounting system was found somewhat  difficult, AIST will have to find a way to solve this problem.    For example, with a blueprint currently under consideration,  MITI will provide a general research direction in its  announcement, such as "an instrument for measuring emotion,  designed to perceive such human emotions as joy and anger based  on a person's appearance so that ideas or prototype devices  which will achieve this goal can be solicited from researchers  working at national research institutes, universities, or  private industries." MITI, then, will select the best candidate  for its project. What AIST is doing is to provide R&amp;D funds  using a method known as "a competition with prize money."    With the existing R&amp;D system supported by the  budget-type  funding, at the time a project is undertaken, its method and  goal, for the most part, are already decided. "Collect marine  organisms to obtain useful genes and matter" and "Develop  heat-resistant material and use it to build an ultra-supersonic  aircraft" are two such examples. The reward-type projects, on  the other hand, are allowed greater flexibility and freedom in  terms of method and idea.    MITI has been successful in handling projects with  relatively  clear-cut goals, such as the establishment of semiconductor  manufacturing techniques or the mass production of solar cells.  On the other hand, its performance in developing uniquely  original technology, the kind of projects which take the world  by surprise, had been less than impressive.    Concluding that such weakness was caused by the vary  characteristic of the non-risk type project research, AIST has  designed the type of research known as a leading-edge research,  which can permit a certain amount of failure, in its industrial  science and technology R&amp;D system.    The idea of using a reward funding formula for a part of a  MITI research project has taken the above design one step  further. Since the project is open to all qualified researchers  willing to submit their ideas or prototype devices and since  their selection process also is open, they tend to be picked up  by mass media, which means that AIST can hope for rekindling of  public interest in science and technology.</p>

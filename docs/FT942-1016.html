			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Afghans exchange one hell for another: The fighting has created thousands of refugees Mr Kutub Khan, his wife and their four small children have spent the last month in a shelter made of sheets in a refugee camp in the sweltering heat of eastern Afghanistan. Around them are hundreds of other make-shift shelters and thousands of tents. The rocky ground is so hard it takes five men a week to dig a latrine. Nothing thrives in this desert except scorpions; there are no trees, no shade from the sun and no escape from the wind. Children die daily from dysentery and malaria. 'It's very hard to live in the open,' says Mr Khan, who cannot find space for his family in a tent. 'But we don't see any hope of going back home.' Relief agencies estimate there are about 150,000 refugees in and around the town of Jalabad. Most have fled the latest outbreak of fighting in Kabul, the capital, which began on January 1. The rest have come from other parts of Afghanistan. As Mr Sotorios Mousouris, the UN secretary general's personal representative for Afghanistan, says: 'You can imagine how hellish conditions must be, if people are ready to come to these camps to escape the fighting and to get food.' Hard as life is in the battle zones of Kabul and elsewhere, it could soon get worse. Mr Burhanuddin Rabbani, the president whose writ does not extend much beyond his ruined capital, is due to step down tomorrow under the terms of a power-sharing accord reached two years ago with rival mujihadeen leaders. But he is refusing to go - to the intense anger of Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the nominal prime minister and head of mujihadeen forces trying to wrest Kabul from the control of Mr Rabbani and his military chief, Mr Ahmad Shah Masood. Mr Hekmatyar told journalists in Jalabad this month that he still wants a peaceful settlement. 'But if the other side insists on staying in power that will mean war.' Mr Rabbani has said he cannot quit until there is peace and has condemned Mr Hekmatyar as a 'warmonger'. Anxious to avoid further destruction, Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the UN secretary general, is trying to bring Afghan leaders together for talks through a mission headed by Mr Mahmood Mestiri, the former Tunisian foreign minister, who visited Afghanistan last month. But he has yet to find a formula acceptable to the rival warlords and Mr Hekmatyar, for one, views the initiative with deep suspicion. Only five years ago, Afghanistan was the focus of world attention. But after the Soviet invaders marched home in 1989 and the communist government they left behind collapsed in early 1992, international interest has waned. But the fighting has not. About 4m out of a population of 20m are still living outside the country, principally as refugees in Pakistan and Iran. Three accords between the nine warring mujihadeen factions - Peshawar 1992, Islamabad 1993 and Jalalabad also 1993 - have failed to end the civil war. While Soviet troops were in Afghanistan, the fighting was mostly in the mountains and the villages. But after they pulled out the mujihadeen pushed into the cities, dividing up territory between them, according to their regional strengths. The main issue their bloody battles have been unable to resolve is control of Kabul, a pleasant city of 1.5m which was mostly intact when the Soviets left. Today it is a collection of battered ruins - at least 10,000 of its inhabitants have been killed since 1992, including over 2,500 this year. About 500,000 have fled their homes, 300,000 hiding in the city and the rest mostly in the camps around Jalabad. The city is being defended in Mr Rabbani's name by Mr Masood, the defence minister, who inherited much of the Communist army's supplies. They are financed principally by shipments of Afghan currency from Russia, where it is still printed - much to the annoyance of Mr Rabbani's enemies. The chief attacker is Mr Hekmatyar, the leader of the Hezb-i-Islami guerrillas, the favourites of Pakistan and the US in the war against the Soviet forces. Late last year, Mr Hekmatyar scored a coup by persuading General Rashid Dostum, master of the Uzbek minority in northern Afghanistan and a former ally of President Rabbani, to change sides and bring his troops into the battle for Kabul. But the tactical advantage was eroded earlier this year when Gen Dostum's forces lost control of Kabul airport in fierce fighting with Mr Masood's men. Outside Kabul, power is largely in the hands of local warlords such as Mr Ismail Khan, an ally of Mr Masood, who has brought a measure of peace to the western oasis of Herat, and Mr Abdul Qadir, governor of Jalalabad in the east, which lies across the main road from Kabul to Pakistan. In the countryside, particularly in the mountains, power is fragmented even further  -a few villages can make a man important, as long as he has guns. These men take money from wherever they can, notably from the fast-growing heroin trade. It is hard to see what can bring an end to this anarchy. With its complex mix of tribal and ethnic groups, Afghanistan has never been a strongly united country and Afghan leaders have often been quick to settle their disputes by fighting. The involvement of the Soviet Union and the US in their wars has left them with an enormous arsenal with which to pursue their quarrels at the expense of people like Mr Khan and his family.</p>

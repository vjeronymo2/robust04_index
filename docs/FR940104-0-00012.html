			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The pipelines and the Joint Parties assert that with the issuance of Order No. 636, and the restructuring of all interstate pipelines, pipelines will no longer retain any transportation capacity. They state that Order No. 636 prohibits a pipeline from retaining or obtaining capacity downstream of the point of unbundling on its system except for storage needed for system management and balancing for no-notice service, and thus all capacity will be allocated to the pipeline's shippers. The pipelines and the Joint Parties state that with all of the pipeline's capacity in the hands of its shippers, the pipeline will have no control over when the capacity will become available. They state that availability will depend, to a large degree, on its release by firm shipper through the pipeline's capacity release program. Moreover, they state when the capacity does become available (either through the release program or as interruptible transportation), the pipeline will have no control over who will get the capacity. They state that the decision will be solely determined by price paid and other objective criteria as specified by the releasing shipper and/or in the pipeline's tariff. The pipelines and the Joint Parties submit that even if a pipeline knew of a particular gas supply and a demand for gas in a particular location and proceeded to pass that information on to its affiliate, no preferential treatment with respect to the provision of transportation services could result. The pipelines and the Joint Parties assert that as Order No. 636 has dispelled the potential for a pipeline to grant an undue preference with respect to transportation services (the purported reason behind Order No. 497), the Commission's newly revised contemporaneous disclosure requirement constitutes nothing more than an arbitrary prohibition against the normal interactions between affiliates, in a manner which places pipeline marketing affiliates at an unjustified disadvantage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Northwest requests that the Commission clarify that it will not apply standard (f) to any conduct regarding sales or marketing information prior to the effective date of Order No. 497&hyph;D.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tenneco requests that the Commission clarify that the contemporaneous disclosure requirement for information regarding on-system sales and marketing information conveyed by the pipeline to its marketing affiliate applies only to the transmission of information by the transportation personnel of the pipeline and not to transmission of information by the unbundled merchant personnel of the pipeline. Tenneco believes that such a clarification is reasonable because in the post-Order No. 636 environment the unbundled merchant will be the functional equivalent of a marketing affiliate because it will not have market power over the sale of natural gas. Further, the pipeline merchant personnel will be required to operate under the exact same restraints with respect to the pipeline transportation personnel that marketing affiliate personnel are required to abide by.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Commission Ruling <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Tenneco,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the court found that ``the contemporaneous disclosure requirement_at least as it affects information regarding transportation, where pipelines have monopolistic market power_reflects a reasonable effort to promote a competitive market without significantly harming existing efficiencies.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  However, with respect to the contemporaneous disclosure of gas sales and marketing information, the court stated that based on the record it was ``unable to conclude that standard (f)'s application to sales and marketing is justified; nor can we be confident that FERC possessed the statutory authority to regulate the transfer of sales and marketing information from pipelines to their affiliates.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The court remanded the proceeding to the Commission and stated that ``[o]n remand, the Commission should consider its justification for applying standard (f) to sales and marketing information and ensure that the final requirement is reasonably tailored to meet the Commission's goals of improving the market and benefitting consumers, as well as preventing undue discrimination.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Upon further review of the issues raised with respect to the disclosure of certain categories of sales and marketing information and in light of the court's findings, the substantive protection of other standards of conduct (particularly standard(e)), <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  structural changes in the industry, and the restructuring mandated by Order No. 636, the Commission will delete from the contemporaneous disclosure requirement of standard (f) the remaining categories of gas sales and marketing information. Pipelines with marketing affiliates will only be required to contemporaneously disclose information related to the transportation of natural gas. The Commission now believes that to impose a general requirement of contemporaneous disclosure of non-transportation information could have a chilling effect on pipelines marketing their gas and does not with any degree of certainty improve the market nor benefit consumers. But while we are limiting the reach of standard (f), pipelines are not relieved of their obligations to refrain from unduly discriminatory conduct that is prohibited under the Natural Gas Act or the Natural Gas Policy Act, whether or not that conduct is covered by standard (f) or any of the other standards. Moreover, while the Commission does not choose to continue a standard requiring contemporaneous disclosure of certain categories of sales and marketing information at this time, this does not bar the Commission from examining such questions, if relevant and necessary, in specific cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Tenneco at 1199.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> at 1199.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> at 1201.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 161.3(e) states that a pipeline ``may not disclose to its affiliate any information the pipeline receives from a nonaffiliated shipper or potential nonaffiliated shipper.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

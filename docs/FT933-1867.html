			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Nafta attack by top US Democrat PROSPECTS for congressional passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement diminished yesterday when Mr Dick Gephardt, House majority leader, announced his opposition to the pact, Our Foreign Staff writes. 'No Nafta is preferable to a deficient Nafta,' he said. Because the current pact did not address Mexico's low-wage levels its passage would increase downward pressure on US wages. He acknowledged that, with or without the pact, the US would lose well-paid jobs to Mexico, but believed Nafta would increase the pace of plant departures. Mr Gephardt, whose influence is vital to the passage of Clinton administration initiatives such as healthcare and campaign reform, stopped short of suggesting the pact be sent back to the White House for renegotiation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] During the National Assembly meeting under President  Geydar Aliyev yesterday, a group of deputies called for a debate  on the Bishkek protocol and proposed that it be included on the  meeting's agenda. It will be recalled that the media gave  significant coverage to the protocol for many days.    The speaker of the parliament outlined his position by  saying  that a debate on the protocol is unnecessary, that a lengthy  debate had already been held. The debate of the protocol was  not included on the agenda, and seventeen deputies walked out of  the meeting. Commenting on the matter, Deputy Kamuran Rakhimov  said the following:    [Begin Rakhimov recording] Creating a confrontation when our  country and people are faced with complex problems is  meaningless. The Bishkek protocol and the effects it will have  on Azerbaijan's future were discussed at the meeting. It was  noted that the protocol's main objective is to end the fighting.  That is in the interest of all the people in Azerbaijan. How  long should we prolong the war? How long should we witness the  death of our young men and attend the funerals of the martyrs?  So, the main objective should be to end the war and establish  peace. In fact, that is the Bishkek protocol's main objective.    The walk-out by a group of deputies from the National  Assembly cannot be justified in any way. I am convinced that  they will realize that state of affairs. [end recording]</p>

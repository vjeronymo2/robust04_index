			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Greys and Reds Arnie, Jack, Warren, Melanie, Jane, Diane. All seek my advice. Arnie called yesterday, worried, as ever, about box office returns and the price of property out towards Malibu. 'Arnie,' I carolled, 'Arnie, baby, of course times are hard. Budgets are being slashed, star salaries axed. The new word on the street is: less equals more, small is beautiful. But that doesn't mean you, Arnie. 'With you, more equals big. That's still where it's at. Which doesn't mean to say that a guy like you, Arnie, political ambitions, shouldn't tread warily. You gotta watch your scripts, Arnie. And you gotta watch your weight. But Malibu, Arnie? Who needs problems? Try Series 6 certificates or Ecu-linked deposits. Or cocoa, Arnie. My instincts tell me cocoa. Or just conceivably emeralds. I'll give you a number, a guy in Tel Aviv.' About the only man in Hollywood I haven't met is Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America, who sounds to me a splendid character, at his best when under fire. Which is just as well, given the mess in which Hollywood finds itself. Is Valenti downcast by Hollywood's downfall? No, he is not. 'People are not satisfied with the dreary plausibilities of everyday living,' he maintains. 'They want to be entertained. Which is why American movies are wanted and watched everywhere on this weary, wracked planet.' According to Jack, Hollywood's main problem is that it has neglected its 'kinship' with its audiences, offering them less than it was capable of and less than they deserve. But Jack has a message. And the message is this: 'When competition for funding grows tense and the struggle for an audience's favour tightens, the creative curve inevitably ascends.' How true that is, how gleamingly insightful. Which is why, last night, I faxed off to Jack, out there in Hollywood, the synopses of four scripts on which I and my under-writers, my talented deputies, are currently labouring. It is scripts like these that will save the movie industry. They are tense with creativity and aimed at family audiences. Moreover, I know a way to film all four for less than Dollars 800,000 - about 1 per cent of what Spielberg spent on Hook. These were the synopses: The Greys and The Reds: The Inside Story of a British General Election. The Greys are headed by a nice man in glasses, the Reds by a loquacious Welshman. Michael Caine plays both parts. In the run-up, both sides wage an unforgiving war of lies, insults and statistics, with five-star general Paddy Ashram, leader of the cruelly outnumbered Third Wave party, mortally wounded in the crossfire. But as the pundits analyse the competing promises of the Greys and Reds, realisation dawns: the parties are indistinguishable, their room for manoeuvre identically circumscribed. So the Greys and Reds join forces. All minority parties are voted into extinction and the Grey-Red party wins every seat. At once, they devalue the pound, lower all taxes (except for the royal family, which is to be taxed severely) and declare the rest of the year a public holiday. There is delirium in the streets. Saddam: The Final Reckoning. Ennobled and deeply loved, Countess Thatcher still writhes with grief at the thought of the monster of Baghdad lurking in his subterranean palace. 'He was my greatest challenge,' she laments, 'but he was snatched from me.' So she pressures her chums in the oil business to finance an expeditionary force. After weeks of bloody hand-to-hand combat, Saddam is overthrown and Iraq liberated. 'I have confronted the Minotaur in his labyrinth, and I have slain him,' declares the countess as the camera pans the burning skyline. The Man From Hyper Space. An alien visits Earth and sets himself up as a media mogul. He buys hundreds of businesses. Also soccer clubs. He is larger than life. Everyone is afraid of him. But then he dies, washed from his yacht one black night. But he is not really dead. During his time on Earth he has amassed Dollars 400bn by circulating funds between his companies at almost the speed of light. So he climbs into his spacecraft and returns to his own world, where Dollars 400bn is not to be sniffed at, despite relativity. The Impossible Dream. The story of a British boxer who wins the world heavyweight title. Still at the early planning stage: there are major credibility problems. Late last night, Jack Valenti rang from Hollywood. 'Michael, baby, I love the synopses. They have comedy, tragedy, pathos, bathos. Audiences will be electrified. They're just what we need on this weary, wracked planet.'</p>

			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / International Company News: Bradesco rises 77% to Dollars 289m BRADESCO, Brazil's largest private bank, posted profits of Dollars 289m for 1992, a 77 per cent increase over 1991. The improvement was partly due to a 25 per cent reduction in provisions for bad debts to Dollars 116m for the year. Loan operations accounted for 28 per cent of the results while a substantial proportion came from subsidiaries, mostly from Bradesco Seguros, the bank's insurance unit. 'The Brazilian insurance market continued growing in 1992, and Bradesco is the market leader,' explained Mr Alcides Lopes Tapias, vice-president. The bank benefited from Brazil's increase in exports. It handled Dollars 6.4bn of exchange operations for shipments abroad, representing 16.7 per cent of the market. The bank enjoyed a 25 per cent increase in this area. Mr Tapias said Bradesco pushed ahead with cost cutting.</p>

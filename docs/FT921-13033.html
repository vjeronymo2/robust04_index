			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Militant takes lesson from Labour - Expulsions MILITANT, the far-left grouping, has expelled two longstanding members, including Mr Ted Grant, its founding theoretician, in a move ironically echoing Labour's purge of Militant supporters. The body accused Mr Grant and Mr Alan Woods of setting up a rival organisation. 'This is a clear split from Militant,' it said. The expulsions stem from Mr Grant's opposition to Militant's plans to abandon Labour entryism and work outside the party. Militant supporters recently launched Scottish Militant Labour - described as a campaigning socialist organisation. An SML candidate, Mr Tommy Sheridan, will contest the Glasgow Pollok seat held by Labour's Mr Jimmy Dunnachie in the general election. Militant will also advocate support for Mr Terry Fields, the Liverpool Broad Green MP recently expelled by Labour, in his attempts to retain the seat on an independent ticket. Militant was at pains yesterday to emphasise that its two rebels had effectively 'excluded themselves'. Their expulsion decision was made at an editorial board meeting.</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: We say 'No' to creeping Fringlish (1) Sir, In response to David Buchan's article ('France says 'Non' to creeping Franglais', February 24), we feel duty bound to expose the French attempt to dominate the English language - as in Fringlish. When dining at La Gavroche, we strenuously attempt to order only those dishes with purely Anglo Saxon names. But unfortunately, in place of the more acceptable 'potatoes creamed with egg, piped into mounds and baked in a hot oven for 25 minutes' we find 'Duchesse potato' more succinct. And attempts to order 'small pots of burnt custard' in place of creme caramel would no doubt be met with forcible ejection from the premises. Perhaps our own culture minister should describe risque jokes as 'audaciously bordering on the unseemly', or enforce etymology on to the school curriculum in place of history? After all, who did win the Napoleonic wars? Jane Johnson, Linsey Mercer, 10 Bishopston, Montacute, Somerset TA15 6UU</p>

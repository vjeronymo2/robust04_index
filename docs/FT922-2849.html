			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / International Company News: 3i puts off flotation until next year 3i, the UK venture capital group, has been forced into yet another delay of its planned flotation by the slowness of the economic recovery. It had originally hoped to list its shares early this year, then shifted its sights to November but has now postponed the date until next year. As part of preparations for a float 3i plans further cost-saving measures on top of those which have already reduced annual outgoings by Pounds 12m. The company is only half way through a cost-cutting programme which has seen staff numbers cut by a third to 670 over the past 18 months, and a reduction from 11 to six in the number of senior managers, according to Mr Ewen Macpherson, managing director. Future savings will be achieved by a slow-down in recruitment and a streamlining of administration systems rather than by redundancies. 3i plans to make more extensive use of credit scoring techniques to assess new and existing investments in preference to more subjective assessment techniques. The short-term pressures normally associated with a stock market listing will not lead to any changes in long-term investment policy, Mr Macpherson said. A study of 3i's investments by Prof Dick Brealey, of London Business School, showed that its portfolio of unquoted investments had a natural dynamism greater than that of investment trusts invested in quoted stocks. Unquoted companies had a one in 10 chance of being taken over in a year compared with quoted companies which had a one in 50 chance, the research showed. This meant that very few companies stayed in 3i's portfolio for more than 10 years. These findings are of crucial importance to 3i. It has made great play of being a long-term investor which does not pressurise the managements it backs to sell off or float their companies. But there are aspects of the way 3i does business which will change as a result of the planned flotation. It believes its accounting policies have been excessively conservative and will be more generous in future in valuing its unquoted holdings. It is also considering the possibility of increasing its involvement in the management of other company's venture capital portfolios. It already manages investments for three small investment trusts and expects further opportunities to occur as a result of the consolidation presently under way in the venture capital industry.</p>

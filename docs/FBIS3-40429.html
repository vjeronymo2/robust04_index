Even if more than half the shares return to the private  sector in the next five years, the three companies will retain  close government ties. The postal minister will control a  regulatory board and the German regional authorities [Laender]  will have the right to inspect companies through a regulatory  council. In addition, a holding company will head the three  companies to coordinate the different advisory bodies. One of  its roles will be to set charges, in consultation with the  postal workers' union Deutsche Postgewerkschaft [DPG].    In other respects, no one yet knows whether the stock market  flotation will serve to strengthen the companies financially or  if proceeds will be used to make up the German budget deficit.    These decisions come at a time when Deutsche Telekom and  France Telecom have decided to strengthen existing ties -- they  jointly own Eucom and Eunetcom -- with plans to create a joint  structure to meet all the international requirements of both  companies.</p>

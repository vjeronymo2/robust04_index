			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ADDICT'S REUNION WITH HER CHILDREN  </P> <P> "Getting It Together" (Dec.24) was a wonderful story of a mother's victory over  cocaine addiction and subsequent reuniting with two children.  </P> <P> However, one item bothered me. And it bothers me in most coverage of the drug  problem. I refer to the mention of the mother's "$700-a-day crack cocaine  habit." That comes to almost $5,000 a week, more $20,000 a month and more than  a quarter of a million dollars a year. Just for drugs.  </P> <P> Where does a heavy-set, semiskilled mother of two come up with that kind of  money? Is it an inheritance, a typographical error or are we being subjected to  exaggerations reminiscent of Vietnam War body counts?  </P> <P> My questioning of the "War on Drugs" concerns the end users: Exactly who are  they and where do they get all the money? So far the pieces aren't fitting  together.  </P> <P> JIM WOOD  </P> <P> Corona del Mar  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In the Gaza Strip, an agreement has been reached  between Fatah Hawks cells and the cells of 'Izz-al-Din  al-Qassam, the military wing of the Hamas movement. The  agreement has been blessed by the leaders of the two movements.  On this agreement and its repercussions, Sa'id Mu'addi spoke  with Rashid Abu-Shibak, a Fatah leader in the Gaza Strip:    [Begin recording] [Mu'addi] Mr. Rashid Abu-Shibak, a  leader of Fatah in the Gaza Strip, what does the Hamas-Fatah  agreement stipulate?    [Abu-Shibak] The agreement is between the Fatah Hawks and  the 'Izzl-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions. It has six major points.  The first talks about an immediate halt to defamation campaigns  between the two factions, while ensuring everybody's right to  free expression, as well as holding further brotherly dialogue  between the two factions in the interests of the Palestinian  masses. The second point speaks about renouncing differences  and bloody conflicts and steering clear of the use of violence  as a means to resolve differences. This point also emphasizes  constructive dialogue between the sons of our people. The third  point is that as of the date of this agreement, the pursued and  armed men on both sides shall be forbidden to interfere and  resolve organizational and family problems. This task will be  assumed by national and Islamic reconciliation committees. The  fourth point states that in view of the deteriorating economic  conditions, it has been decided that a strike in the event of  the martyrdom of any citizen shall last only one day in his  vicinity. The rest of the areas will declare mourning but will  not be on strike. Fifth, male and female students are asked to  attend classes on strike days, because we do not want our  students to miss classes. Finally, Fatah and Hamas have decided  to stop the killing of agents as of the date of this agreement  for one month and to declare this one-month period as a  repentance period. These are the points of the agreement.    [Mu'addi] Mr. Abu-Shibak, how did the idea of holding  dialogue and reaching such an agreement crystallize between the  two movements?    [Abu-Shibak] First of all, the idea of holding dialogue has  always been one of our traditions in Fatah and also on the part  of Hamas. Our dialogue with Hamas has never stopped for one  minute. However, praise be to God, our dialogue has this time  been crowned by an agreement that will contribute to stopping  the suffering of our people as much as possible.    [Mu'addi] Mr. Abu-Shibak, Israeli quarters have voiced  concern over such agreements and Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  has said such agreement could affect the Israeli-Palestinian  agreement.    [Abu-Shibak] I do not think the topic addressed by Rabin has  anything to do with the agreement we are talking about. Our  agreement with Hamas addresses daily problems and concerns that  face Palestinian citizens in the Gaza Strip. It has nothing to  do with a specific political agreement.    [Mu'addi] Can we take the agreement between the Fatah Hawks  and the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam cells to be a forerunner of  possibly another agreement between the leaders of the two  movements, Fatah and Hamas, during the self-rule period?    [Abu-Shibak] We hope this will be the case. We will seek a  broader and more inclusive agreement between Fatah and Hamas.  There is a good chance for such an agreement, particularly  since we, along with the brothers in the Hamas movement, very  much want everybody to take part in the forthcoming self-rule  authority, since this will be for the good of all the  Palestinian masses in the future.    [Mu'addi] Was the agreement blessed by the leaders of Fatah  and Hamas in the Gaza Strip?    [Abu-Shibak] Yes, completely. We stress this agreement and  consider it an important and positive step toward improving our  relationship with the brothers in Hamas.    [Mu'addi] Mr. Rashid Abu-Shibak, thank you very much.    [Abu-Shibak] You are welcome. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THERE IS TRADITION FOR BYU; IT BOILS DOWN TO RESPECT;  </P> <P> HOLIDAY: THE COUGARS, COMING OFF AN EMBARRASSING LOSS TO HAWAII, WILL TRY TO  PROVE THEMSELVES AGAINST TEXAS A&amp;M ON SATURDAY.  </P> <P> Stop us if you have heard this before:  </P> <P> Brigham Young's football team, with an impressive record and high national  ranking, covers enough land throwing the ball to make even the best real estate  agents green with envy. The end of the season arrives, and the Cougars make  their bowl reservations.  </P> <P> Surprise, it's the Holiday Bowl, home of the Western Athletic Conference  champion. The game approaches. The Cougars prepare for traditional a big-time  opponent, such as Ohio State or Michigan or Penn State. But many football fans  across the nation yawn. Wake us up when BYU plays a real team, they say.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, BYU players bristle. They talk about getting respect. And the bowl  arrives . . .  </P> <P> Welcome to Holiday Bowl week, 1990. BYU will play Texas A&amp;M (8-3-1)  Saturday.  </P> <P> It will be BYU's ninth appearance in the 14-year history of the Holiday Bowl.  It has come to be expected, like finding your newspaper in the driveway each  morning.  </P> <P> The Cougars are 10-2, including a 28-21 victory over No. 1 Miami in Provo Sept.  8. BYU eventually crept as high as fourth in the national rankings and, as  recently as 3 1/2 weeks ago, had a chance at the national championship.  </P> <P> Then the Cougars went to Hawaii Dec. 1. Quarterback Ty Detmer received word  that afternoon that he had won the Heisman Trophy.  </P> <P> And BYU received a good, old-fashioned whipping that night, 59-28, as four  passes by Detmer were intercepted.  </P> <P> The chorus of naysayers started immediately. BYU, a national championship team?  Ha!  </P> <P> So BYU, rated 13th, arrives a little red in the face. The Cougars will line up  against unranked Texas A&amp;M and, like most of their bowl games in the past,  this one will be about respect.  </P> <P> Fullback Matt Bellini said, "We're out to prove to people we're a top-10 team.  We get wound up to play big opponents, because we don't get respect because of  the conference we play in.  </P> <P> "And, we throw the football. We're not three-yards-and-a-cloud of dust."  </P> <P> BYU is ranked second nationally in pass efficiency with a rating of 155.5,  total offense of 565.8 yards a game and scoring of 42.5 points a game. Detmer  is second in pass efficiency with a rating of 155.9 and total offense with  418.5 yards a game. Receiver Andy Boyce finished fourth in catches per game  with 6.58 and in reception yardage with 1,241.  </P> <P> The most familiar names are Detmer, who has passed for 5,188 yards this season,  and Chris Smith, BYU's All-American tight end. But don't forget about Boyce, a  senior wide receiver, who caught 79 passes and averaged 15.7 yards per catch  and a team-high 103.4 yards per game.  </P> <P> "Andy Boyce has had an outstanding year," BYU Coach LaVell Edwards said. "Ty  and Chris Smith have gotten the attention, but Andy Boyce has been a big plus  for us."  </P> <P> There is something else you should know about this team. Edwards likes more  than the offense.  </P> <P> "The way we've developed defensively, and the way we've developed as a team,  period," he said.  </P> <P> "When we started last spring, we were a long way away from being a  championship-caliber football team. But we stayed healthy. And the defense  really played well until that last game against Hawaii."  </P> <P> BYU is toughest against the run, having limited opponents to an average of  116.3 yards a game. The Cougars' best defenders are senior end Rich Kaufusi,  senior linebacker Alema Fitisemanu and senior back Brian Mitchell. All were  first-team all-WAC picks.  </P> <P> But if you ask Edwards what impressed him most this year, he won't talk of  Miami, or of the Washington State game the next week, when the Cougars turned a  29-7 halftime deficit into a 50-36 victory. He won't tell you about his 13th  WAC championship in 19 years of coaching, or about Detmer's Heisman.  </P> <P> His favorite thing about 1990?  </P> <P> "The kind of kids we have," he said.  </P> <P> "I've had fewer problems among this team than any I've had in some time. They  all seem to like each other. Nobody has been jealous of Ty. There have been no  personality conflicts."  </P> <P> The biggest disappointment was the loss in Hawaii. The Cougars were 10-1 at the  time, having lost only Sept. 29 at Oregon, 32-16, on a day when five of  Detmer's passes were intercepted.  </P> <P> But that was nothing compared to Hawaii, which Edwards said ranked with BYU's  38-37 loss to Indiana in the 1979 Holiday Bowl as the most disappointing in his  career. Maybe it wouldn't have been quite so bad had the same thing not  happened a year earlier, when BYU also was beaten in Hawaii, 56-14.  </P> <P> "Having had that happen to us the year before . . . I just couldn't believe  it," Edwards said.  </P> <P> "We had good practices, good intensity. I don't know whether the Heisman  (earlier in the day) had anything to do with it. You can start figuring out all  kinds of reasons."  </P> <P> Said Bellini: "It took me a long time to get over it. I still don't know what  happened. They did the same thing the year before. I don't know if we don't  match up with them or what."  </P> <P> So the Cougars come to San Diego in search of respect. It was that way when  they won their only national championship in 1984, clinched by a 24-17 Holiday  Bowl victory over Michigan, and it remains that way this week.  </P> <P> "I think that has something to do with it," Bellini said.  </P> <P> "I remember (1988), we lost three of our last four and came into the Freedom  Bowl and beat a good Colorado team (20-17). It's a similar-type situation now.  </P> <P> "Although we have a better team now, I think pride is still involved. Whether  we're ranked sixth or 12th, we've got to try to win.  </P> <P> "I'm sure there are people out there saying they don't think we're a good team.  I'm looking forward to showing them we can play."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Holiday Bowl Notes  </P> <P> Kickoff is scheduled for 4:30 p.m. Saturday . . . BYU is 4-4 in Holiday Bowls.  Texas A&amp;M is making its first appearance. . . . Brigham Young fullback Matt  Bellini is a tentative starter. Bellini suffered torn ligaments in his right  ankle at Utah Nov. 17. He missed the next week's Utah State game and played  sparingly against Hawaii. Although he is a fullback, he is used mainly as a  receiver -- his 204 receptions rank ninth on the NCAA career list and second on  the WAC career list.  </P></p>

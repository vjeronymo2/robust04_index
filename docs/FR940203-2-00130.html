The commenter was concerned that changes were needed in order to ensure a viable role in the program not merely for vocational high schools but also for comprehensive high schools and recommended that references to comprehensive high schools be added in paragraph (b)(3) of the priority as well as in other parts of the notice where secondary schools are discussed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretaries fully intend that comprehensive high schools be included in each statewide School-to-Work Opportunities system. In order to implement a comprehensive School-to-Work Opportunities system serving all students, States must ensure opportunities for the participation of all students, including students in comprehensive high schools. Under the School-to-Work Opportunities program and under this priority, it would be unacceptable for only vocational high schools, for example, to be included in a State's implementation plan. However, the Secretaries believe that specific reference to comprehensive high schools is unnecessary, since the term ``secondary'' encompasses all schools at the secondary level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Priority_Education and Training Funds Coordination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Under paragraph (b)(4) of the priority notice, each State is required to describe how its comprehensive School-to-Work Opportunities system will coordinate the use of funds available from State and private sources with the use of funds available from other Federal programs. One commenter suggested that a clause be added to paragraph (b)(4) requiring the coordination of program activities funded with State and private sources with Federal program funds. The commenter also recommended that the JOBS program be specifically listed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In response to the part of the comment suggesting that a specific reference be added to paragraph (b)(4) to ``program activities'' supported with State or private funds, the Secretaries have concluded that such a reference is unnecessary. The requirement in that paragraph is for coordination of the use of Federal education and training funds. Included within the requirement articulated in paragraph (b)(4), is the requirement for coordination between the program activities supported with the State and private funds and the program activities supported with funding received under related Federal statutes. The Secretaries agree that the JOBS program should be specifically listed. However, it is important to note that the list of Federal programs in paragraph (b)(4) is not an exhaustive list of related Federal programs with which the use of State and private funds should be coordinated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A specific reference to JOBS has been added to paragraph (b)(4) of the priority notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Priority_Assessing Skills and Knowledge and Participation in the Goals 2000: Educate America Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters stated that in paragraph (b)(9), which requires States to describe their processes for assessing the skills and knowledge required in career majors and in awarding skills certificates that take into account the work of the proposed National Skill Standards Board and the criteria established under the proposed Goals 2000: Educate America Act, the priority ignores the fact that participation in Goals 2000 is voluntary. One commenter noted that requiring students to receive a skill certificate, as a common feature of the program, assumes that the Goals 2000: Educate America Act, which contains provisions for voluntary industry-based skill standards, will be enacted into law. This commenter felt that it was inconsistent to require a skill certificate based on enactment of a law which establishes only voluntary, industry-based, skill standards. Accordingly, the commenters suggested that language be added to this paragraph of the priority notice, indicating that the standards or criteria developed under Goals 2000 will only be required if the State is participating in Goals 2000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Mr Major resolutely refused to be drawn on the issue yesterday  as his appearance at the NATO summit in Brussels was disrupted  by the deepening controversy over the private lives and  financial affairs of Conservative MPs and ministers.    Mr Major's difficulties have been compounded by the loss of  two ministers in less than a week -- Lord Caithness, who  resigned as minister for shipping after the apparent suicide of  his wife, and Mr Tim Yeo, after disclosures about his  extra-marital affair with a Tory councillor.    Mr David Ashby, MP for Leics NW, forcefully denied last  night  reports that he had left his wife and was having a homosexual  relationship with a male friend. He admitted he had shared a  hotel bed in France with the man, but denied the imputation  attached to what was a longstanding friendship. He was now  reconciled with his Italian-born wife, Sylvana. With MPs back  at Westminster today, Government whips are anxious to curtail  the flood of disclosure, speculation and innuendo which was in  full spate yesterday.    Mr Waldegrave, Minister for Public Service, tried to play  down what he called a "series of eccentric events" that would  not deflect the Government from its job of running the country.    "There is one real, terrible tragedy in all of this, the  death of Lady Caithness," he said on Channel 4 News.    "The rest of it is almost the stuff of pantomime -- the  width  of beds in hotels in France: we seem to have gone potty. The  Government has better things to do than lecture people about  private morals." At the weekend, Mr Major called for an end to  moral "witch hunts" against Tories who had behaved foolishly in  their personal lives and appealed for tolerance.    But the question of private morality has become entangled in  his Back to Basics campaign to the annoyance of ministers and  the despair of backbenchers who felt the Government had turned  the corner after a difficult year.    In Brussels, Mr Major brushed aside questions on domestic  events and would respond only to inquiries about the summit. Mr  Hurd, Foreign Secretary, was equally unforthcoming when asked  about recent scandals and whether the Tory Party was "dead on  its feet."    Later this week he is expected to join other ministers  drafted in to try to salvage Back to Basics.    Mr Major is intent on pressing ahead with the initiative to  demonstrate that it applies across a wide range of policy--from  education to law and order--and is not a new moral code for  Government ministers or the nation.    But while he sought to deflect questions about Back to  Basics  in Brussels, the debate raged in Britain on the eve of what  promises to be a turbulent parliamentary session for the  Government.    Mr Patten, Education Secretary, said he could not remember a  more fraught period for the party in his 14 years as an MP.    "I think John Major has had a peculiarly difficult seven or  eight days," he added on LBC radio. "We all have because of  these events crowding in about people's alleged improprieties  here, there and everywhere--the tragic death of Lady Caithness  on Saturday [8 January]--I can't remember any time since I have  been in the House when it has been so difficult."    Lord Archer, the former Tory chairman, said the party had  been,"blown off course" by recent events after a period when  many had hoped its fortunes were on the mend. But he added:  "In a few weeks' time, people will be getting down to things  that really matter."    In the Cabinet, arguments continued over the extent to which  the Back to Basics philosophy should be founded on matters of  personal morality.    Mr Howard, Home Secretary, emphasised that the concept was  about individual responsibility but "not preaching or  hectoring". He added: "It does not involve those matters which  are more the responsibility of the pulpit than politicians."    Mr Redwood, the Welsh Secretary whose strictures against  single mothers last summer prompted Opposition criticisms, said:  "The moral and single parent issues are important to the  Government."    Backbenchers showed increasing irritation with the way the  Back to Basics policy was unravelling and called on Mr Major to  redefine it in a way that allowed no misunderstandings.    Dame Jill Knight, MP for Edgbaston and an executive member  of  the Tory backbench 1922 Committee, said Back to Basics went  wider than this "one rather narrow though extremely important  aspect of responsibility."    Mr Bill Cash, MP for Stafford, said: "The Government has got  a policy about family values which I do think is sustainable  irrespective of the fact that a number of people seem to have  wandered off course."    Mr James Cran, MP for Beverley, said: "Many of us want to  see  the Prime Minister and his ministers really getting down and  reducing to black and white what his vision of Back to Basics is  meant to be."</p>

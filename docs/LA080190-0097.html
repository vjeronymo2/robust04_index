			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> LOW COCAINE SUPPLY CITED AS U.S. MURDER TOLL SOARS  </P> <P> America's murder toll may break a decade-old record this year, the Senate  Judiciary Committee said Tuesday. It blamed rising stockpiles of assault  weapons and shrinking supplies of cocaine.  </P> <P> If the pace of killing continues, the committee said, 23,220 people will be  murdered this year. That figure would make it, in the words of the panel's  chairman, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), "the bloodiest year in American  history."  </P> <P> The panel said that murders are projected to top last year's total by 2,000 and  exceed even the record of 23,040 in 1980.  </P> <P> The current murder rate of 10.5 per 100,000 people makes the United States "the  most murderous industrialized nation" in the world, the panel said. In Great  Britain, the rate is 0.8 per 100,000; in Japan, 1.0, and in West Germany, 1.2.  </P> <P> As reasons for the soaring murder toll, the committee cited:  </P> <P>  -- Dwindling supplies of cocaine in major cities, which it said has ignited  drug turf wars.  </P> <P>  -- A growing arsenal of assault weapons in the hands of drug dealers and other  lawbreakers. "These firearms have become the weapons of choice for drug dealers  and the weapons of doom for law enforcement personnel," the committee said.  </P> <P>  -- A fresh wave of jobless, crime-prone teen-agers.  </P> <P> The report said that the murder toll "began to rise significantly in the late  1960s and did not fall until the early 1980s. . . . This trend followed from an  unusually large number of 18- to 24-year-olds in the general population.  </P> <P> "This age group is the most violent one, and the murder toll often swells with  its ranks."  </P> <P> The nation's murder total fell 18% from 1980 to 1985, but it has risen 22%  since then.  </P> <P> Dr. J. Lawrence Cogan, chief medical examiner of Los Angeles County, said that,  as drug wars sweep inner-city street corners, he is "seeing more cases of  multiple gunshot wounds, and many of these involving high-velocity firearms."  </P> <P> Biden urged swift House action on a Senate-passed bill that would ban nine  semiautomatic assault weapons and impose the death penalty for 34 federal  offenses.  </P> <P> Drawing on FBI figures, the committee said that California led the nation in  murders last year with 3,158. The panel projected violent deaths this year in  the nation's most-populous state at 3,442, a 9% increase.  </P></p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: Mexican group to pay Dollars 708m for hotel chain The Japanese company Aoki Corporation has agreed in principle to sell the Westin Hotel &amp; Resort chain for Dollars 708m to a group of investors led by Bernardo Dominguez, the chief executive of DSC, a large Mexican business. The Aoki Corporation bought Westin Hotel &amp; Resort in 1988. The chain operates more than 70 luxury hotels in 19 countries. It has around 42,000 rooms, and reported revenues of about Dollars 420m a year. Mr Dominguez and investors will buy about 50 of the hotels, with those in Asia, six in Canada, and some minority investments in the US remaining in the hands of the Aoki Corporation. The two companies will sign agreements co-ordinating services, marketing and sales to ensure the Westin group operates as an integrated organisation. DSC is a privately-owned company with interests in construction, property and tourism. It owns several four-star hotels in Mexico, and one of the country's largest travel agencies and tour operators. Mr Pablo Macedo, head of DSC's tourism group, said the new owner would expand the Westin hotel chain in Europe and Latin America. He said DSC would not run the Westin hotel group, but that Mr Dominguez, as chairman of the board, would play an important part in overseeing its operations. The letter of intent to conclude the transaction was signed between the two groups at the weekend. The transaction is expected to be finalised in the second quarter of 1994, according to a joint statement by Aoki and Mr Dominguez. Aoki was advised by The Blackstone Group of the US, and Mr Dominguez by Salomon Brothers.</p>

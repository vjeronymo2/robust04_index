The comrade general secretary heard reports from various  party cadres on plans to carry out midterm conferences of  provincial party organizations which are expected to take place  in late February and March this year. Attendees at these  conferences will discuss the political reports of the party  organizations and elect supplementary members for provincial  party committees in accordance with the party by-laws. [passage  omitted]    On direction for socioeconomic development of the central  region provinces, the comrade general secretary pointed out that  at present the central region still lags behind others in terms  of economic development and living standards of local people.  But the region also possesses latent strength and potential  within its forest land, sea, minerals, geographical location,  and especially the people here who inherit fine traditions of  industriousness, intelligence, and brave and persistent  determination in fighting against natural disasters and other  enemies. These are advantages and conditions for a diversified  development of the local economy. The general secretary  stressed that the central region has a strategic position in  terms of economic, security, and national defense. It is not  true to say that the central government only cares about the  other two regions and neglects the central one. The major water  conservancy projects, the important hydroelectric projects in  the central highlands, and the 500-kv electricity project are in  the interests of the central region. We have at the same time  too many things to be done and we have to do them in sequence  aiming to serve the national interest in the principle of  equality to all regions.    The comrade general secretary urged the provincial  authorities to find suitable and effective measures and  strategies to develop economic potential, to build more water  conservancy projects, to cover all empty lands and bare hills,  and to develop other employment branches in order to promote  industrialization. The localities also need to intensify their  exports, limit and substitute imports, exploit the advantage of  sea transport, and consolidate interaction between provinces in  business relations with foreign countries.    The comrade general secretary pointed out an issue that  needs  to be tackled urgently which is programs to eliminate hunger and  reduce poverty for people in mountain and minority ethnic  regions, as well as in former revolutionary bases. The programs  need to motivate self-help consciousness among people and avoid  a reliant attitude, and only in this way can socioeconomic  development can be attained. He said: We are to be seriously  blamed if we let the families of wounded soldiers and war dead  live in poverty. We have to invest in building and developing  the former revolutionary bases. We have to be just and fair in  distribution of production materials and supplies as stipulated  by the party resolution.    The comrade general secretary said: To correctly carry out  the two strategic tasks of building and safeguarding our  fatherland, we must focus on building our party cleanly and  steadfastly, and on heightening the militancy and self-control  spirit among the party member contingent. The party members  must exercise solidarity and attach utmost importance to mass  motivation tasks in order to build up an all-people solidarity  block. The party cadres should work for the people, be close to  people, and not be revolutionary mandarins. All our work should  be devoted to the development and prosperity of our country and  the happiness of the people. [passage omitted]    During their visit to Quang Nam-Danang, Comrades General  Secretary Do Muoi and his entourage paid visits to several  localities and families of peasants and fishermen who are among  the poorest people in Zone 2, Phuoc Ly Ward in Danang city; and  the Que Linh Village in Que Son District, 60-km from Danang, one  of the former revolutionary bases which is still very poor.  Comrade general secretary entered houses and warmly talked to  the poor peasants and presented a number of new year gifts to  families of wounded soldiers and war dead. He urged the party  committees and local authorities to carry out effective measures  to quickly solve socioeconomic problems of people in mountain  and remote areas, with the prime attention focused on developing  water conservancy projects. He said: I have been working for  the revolution all my life and whenever I talk to peasants I  always remember three main points: first, peasants must have  their land; second, water conservancy is important; and third,  capital must be available. In order to eliminate hunger and  reduce poverty quickly, we must help peasants in these three  areas. [passage omitted]</p>

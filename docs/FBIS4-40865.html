			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Iveri Prangishvili, honorary president of </F> the Reformers Union of Georgia, by Maka Khetsuriani; date, place  not given]    [Text] Academician Iveri Prangishvili, one of the founders  of the Reformers Union and its honorary president, answered  three questions put to him by our correspondent.    [Khetsuriani] Batoni Iveri, what does the Reformers  Union represent and what are its aims?    [Prangishvili] First and foremost, the Reformers Union is  not a political party but an organization whose aim is to  conduct reforms in a correct manner in the Georgian economy. To  all intents and purposes, we do not have an economy today; at  the moment, we can only dream of producing goods. In order to  restore the economy, it is necessary, first and foremost, to  restore the old ties with the republics of the former Soviet  Union that have been ruptured. According to our model, by the  end of 1994, 50 percent of enterprises will be made bankrupt,  there will be no more state subsidies, and any enterprise that  is unable to produce goods will be unable to exist. The  economic decline will reach its peak at the end of 1995 and then  come to an end and we will have regulated the situation by about  2000; so, there exists only one way of reviving the economy and  this is by concluding treaties with the CIS countries, restoring  ties with enterprises, renewing relations with factories and  institutes, exchanging specialists and carrying out joint work;  we should inform the people in detail of the first successful  steps and their positive results.    [Khetsuriani] Do you think that structural changes are  necessary in industry and agriculture?    [Prangishvili] The Reformers Union understands full well  that, in order to transfer to a market economy, structural  changes should gradually be made in industry and agriculture.  However, we should remember that, in the transitional period,  we should first invigorate and revive existing economic and  management structures and subsequently set about modernizing  them. At the same time, new economic and management structures  should be formed and there should be a stage-by-stage transfer  to them according to our state of readiness. It is necessary to  carry out evolutionary reforms gradually and thereby the revival  of relations between existing enterprises and management  structures and their future modernization will be less painful  for society than neglecting what exists and forming something  new.    [Khetsuriani] What factors could prove effective in  halting the economic decline?    [Prangishvili] First: Inflation will slow down. Its rate  will fall to 7-10 percent per month. This will continue for  eight to 10 months and this will already be an indicator of  stability in the financial system.    Second: Price rises will be checked! If, in 1993, prices  rose by a factor of 20, they will rise by a factor of only four  or five during this period.    The third factor: Unstable enterprises will go bankrupt. The  number of such enterprises will rise from the current level of  30 percent to 70 percent.    Against this background, I would like to remind you once  more  how important it will be to restore economic ties between  enterprises. Today, our enterprises do not have funds and  sufficient cadres. They only have premises and old useless  equipment. The principal branches of industry are not  functioning; for example, the textile industry is at a complete  standstill. It is impossible to change this situation and  revive production and the economy without restoring the  aforementioned ties.    Naturally, the establishment of ties with other countries as  well will render great service to the revival of our economy;  for example, a treaty will be concluded with the United States  in accordance with which we should be allocated credits to  construct 200 small hydroelectric power stations. We hope that  we will also be given help in constructing a 600 megawatt  thermal power station in Kutaisi. All of this lies in the  future. It is precisely the realization of these prospects that  forms the aim of the Reformers Union. If we achieve the  development of our country's economy, we, both the founders and  members of the union, will feel that we have fulfilled our duty  to Georgia.</p>

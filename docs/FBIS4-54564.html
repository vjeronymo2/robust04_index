			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with M. Hudina, deputy to the National Council of </F> the Slovak Republic, by an unidentified PRACA correspondent;  place and date not given: "Disagreement With Orientation; M.  Hudina Has Become an Independent Deputy"]    [Text] "Have you officially announced your departure from  the Club of Deputies and the Movement?" PRACA No. 97 asked M.  Hudina, deputy of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS].    [Hudina] I notified the parliament chairman in writing last  week.    [PRACA] What made you leave the HZDS?    [Hudina] There were reports about the HZDS conducting  negotiations on the formation of a national democratic bloc.  Because I was the sole deputy of Hungarian nationality in the  HZDS Club of Deputies, I realized that I could not remain in  such a bloc. My decision was also influenced by the passage of  the law on names and surnames, by the so-called law on bilingual  signs, and, last but not least, by the speeches by I. Chamula of  the Slovak National Party, who constantly attacks the Hungarian  ethnic minority. I was not enthusiastic about the formation of  a coalition with this party and was the only [HZDS] deputy who  did not sign it.    [PRACA] You have become an independent deputy. Toward which  party do you lean?    [Hudina] I was present at the constituent assembly of the  Democratic Union of Slovakia and will most probably become its  member.</p>

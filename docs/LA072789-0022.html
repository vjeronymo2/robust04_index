			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR WHEELS: THE HEAT'S ON THE MOST RECENT MODELS  </P> <P> Question: My brand-new Chevrolet seems to get hotter after sitting in the  summer sun than some of my past cars. It's white, like the others, so I don't  think the color has anything to do with it. Is GM using less insulation or  something? -- I.P.  </P> <P> Answer: The dog days of summer are here again, and modern car designs are  indeed causing interiors to gain more solar heat than in the past. Modern  aerodynamic designs feature sloping windows and greater total window area,  which allows cars to heat up more in the summer sun. It is not uncommon for  newer cars to reach interior temperatures of 138 degrees after sitting in the  sun.  </P> <P> In part, that is why you are seeing so many motorists equipping their rear and  side car windows with reflective film, which manufacturers of the product claim  can cut solar heating by 35% to 65%. If that is true, it reduces the load on  the air-conditioning system and keeps the car cooler with the air conditioning  on. (California Highway Patrol asserts it is illegal to use film on windshields  and front side windows.)  </P> <P> GM has an experimental station in Mesa, Ariz., to test how its mechanical  systems and materials hold up in intense sunlight and desert heat. Jack  Jacquette, director of the center, said the increase in glass surface area in  recent years has led to a lot of research to find better ways to cool down  cars.  </P> <P> The company is investigating better glass, which will help reflect heat without  solar-reflective film. They are hoping that a chemical process in making the  glass will help restrict heat waves from passing through the glass. Motorist  comfort is not the only reason for the concern. Big loads on air-conditioning  systems cut fuel economy.  </P> <P> "Extremes of temperature and humidity can impose a 20% penalty on fuel  economy," he said. "We are deeply involved in better understanding solar  radiation and temperature effects."  </P> <P> One related area involves the longevity of interior materials, particularly  upholstery that is subject to serious damage from sunlight. "We are trying to  perceive in a few months how materials will hold up in five or 10 years," he  said.  </P> <P> Separately, GM is using computerized models to help develop better  air-conditioning systems. Using fluid mechanics borrowed from the aircraft  industry, GM is trying to understand how an air conditioner can be optimized.  The physical effects under study include examining the effects of air blowing  from vents, the circulation of hot air masses inside the car, the heat transfer  effects and the time it takes to cool down a boiling-hot car.  </P> <P> Q: A number of years ago, you wrote a column about how to adjust headlights. It  worked great, but now I need to do it again and I never kept the column. Could  you please give me the instructions again? -- S.H.  </P> <P> A: Every state has a vehicle code that specifies how headlights must be aimed  and where the headlights can be placed on the vehicle. These laws are  complicated, and performing the adjustments to the letter of the law isn't easy  for an average motorist.  </P> <P> The code in California, for example, specifies that in a two-headlight system  the intense portion of the light beam at a distance of 25 feet may not be  higher than 5 inches below the lamp from which it comes. There are other  regulations on stray light, fog lights and much else.  </P> <P> Garages with the proper equipment can perform this adjustment so that the light  beams conform to that standard.  </P> <P> Many garages, though, use a mark on a wall, which may or may not be adequate.  You could probably do just as well by carefully marking two sets of  perpendicular lines on your garage door that correspond to your car's headlight  position. You'd then back up 25 feet and attempt to aim the headlight five  inches below the center points of the lines.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Vartabedian cannot answer mail personally but will respond in this column to  automotive questions of general interest.

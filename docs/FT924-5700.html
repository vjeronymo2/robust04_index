			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Ottawa props up Canadian Airlines THE Canadian government is providing CDollars 50m (USDollars 39.6m) to prop up Canadian Airlines International while talks continue on a contentious alliance between the ailing Calgary-based airline and American Airlines of Dallas. The funds fall far short of the CDollars 290m in federal and provincial government loan guarantees sought by PWA Corp, Canadian's parent company, to fulfil conditions set by American. However, the support is likely to be sufficient to keep Canadian flying until at least Christmas. Canadian is in a furious battle for survival with its rival, Air Canada. The two carriers are losing about CDollars 2m a day between them. Mr Jean Corbeil, transport minister, indicated yesterday that Ottawa was unhappy with some aspects of American Airlines' proposal, which was presented to the government earlier this month by Mr Rhys Eyton, PWA's chairman, and a group of PWA employees. Mr Corbeil said that conditions set by American 'raise for the government a number of difficult issues', including federal budget constraints and an unwillingness to expose taxpayers to imprudent financial risk. American has proposed investing CDollars 246m in PWA for a 25 per cent equity stake, the maximum allowed by law. PWA employees would contribute another CDollars 100m-CDollars 150m. However, the US carrier has demanded a veto over PWA's business plan, the appointment of its chief executive and any sizeable capital outlay or acquisition. The most contentious issue is American's demand that Canadian join American's Sabre computerised reservation system, abandoning its links with the Gemini system which it shares with Air Canada. The government's dilemma is reinforced by the political overtones of the airline battle. With its base in Calgary, PWA is a flagship of western Canadian business. Air Canada's head office is in Quebec. Offending either region could cost the ruling Conservative party dearly in next year's general election.</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Observer: Publicis Albion The English claim to have invented fair play. No one's fooled by that old chestnut, however, least of all the French, it seems. 'Chanteclair', a pseudonymous French author, reckons that British notions of fair play are risible. In practice, it's claimed, the idea is for export only, designed to weaken and humiliate the opposition. Chanteclair's new book, Pour en finir avec l'Anglais (roughly translated as 'To have done with English'), dishes out abuse, depicting the English as the 'dirtiest', 'beastliest' and 'most hypocritical' of nations. It's gone down a storm - in France. Well, how's this for fair play, old chap? The London Tourist Board is spending Pounds 30m over the next three years on an advertising campaign promoting the capital to British, American, Japanese and continental European tourists. British-owned advertising agencies Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and Ogilvy &amp; Mather - presumably having played as fair as advertising agencies do in this sort of thing - were pipped at the post by none other than Publicis, one of France's leading advertising groups. Pour encourager les autres, presumably.</p>

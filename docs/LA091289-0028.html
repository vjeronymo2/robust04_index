			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: FLAG-BURNING ISSUE: PLAYING WITH FIRE  </P> <P> Congress has been hard at work trying to come up with a constitutional  amendment that makes it illegal to burn the American flag. It is a hot topic  for legislation because it could be the only issue in the coming elections.  This is particularly true since there has been no movement in Congress on any  other issues.  </P> <P> Campaign managers are now hard at work thinking of ways to make their  candidate's opponents look like flag abusers. The obvious television commercial  is a burning flag in the street with a voice-over saying, "Walt Wallemeer  couldn't care less that someone set fire to your flag. It's no surprise since  flag-burning is something he has practiced since he got into politics."  </P> <P> Make no mistake about it. The campaign is going to get dirty and Old Glory is  going to be the issue.  </P> <P> There is one problem with all this. There has been no reported flag-burning  incident in the United States for two years.  </P> <P> When Jackal, who is running Cumbersome's campaign, went to the TV station to  buy a piece of flag-burning film for his commercial, he was informed no new  footage existed.  </P> <P> Rothermere, the head of the station, told him, "Nobody seems to be burning  flags these days. They are shooting people, sticking them up, throwing rocks at  each other, and setting fire to cars -- but not to the flag. Our field  producers have assured demonstrators that if they burn the flag we'll guarantee  that their demonstration will get on the evening news, but we have yet to find  anyone who will go to the trouble."  </P> <P> Jackal said, "I can't believe it. How can we pass a constitutional amendment  against desecrating the flag when no one will do it?"  </P> <P> "You have a problem," the station manager admitted. "We have some footage of  flag-burning from the anti-Vietnam War demonstrations. But the color is faded  and it looks dated."  </P> <P> Jackal agreed. "That wouldn't work because we want to show that flag-burning is  a clear and present danger."  </P> <P> "We have shots of people into dope and arson and white-collar crime coming out  of our ears. We even have groups hanging the vice president in effigy. We have  pictures of street gangs shooting automatic submachine guns, but for some  reason we have no flag abusers on tape. This is a real surprise because you  hear nothing but speeches from politicians on flag-burning."  </P> <P> Jackal said, "We had the same problem during the Communist witch hunts.  Everyone was against Communists but we didn't have any. Do you know what we  did? We invented them. We had the entire country believing there was a  Communist in every garage. We can do the same with the flag-burners. If there  aren't any, we'll invent them."  </P> <P> "Does this mean you will have phony flag-torchers in your commercials?"  </P> <P> "If that is the only way to get a constitutional amendment, then it must be  done. Maybe they aren't burning the American flag today -- but tomorrow they  will, and then we'll have the law on the books to protect us."  </P> <P> "But if you burn the flag to make your commercial, won't you be desecrating  it?"  </P> <P> "I'd only be doing it to make a patriotic point."  </P> <P> "Which is?"  </P> <P> "My country -- right or wrong."  </P></p>

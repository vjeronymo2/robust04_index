			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> SCHOOLS HIRE HEAD OF SUPPORT SERVICES  </P> <P> Richard L. Donoghue will replace John Perry as assistant superintendent of  support services for the Orange Unified School District.  </P> <P> Donoghue, who has been assistant superintendent of business services for Pomona  Unified since 1984, signed a contract earlier this week for a starting salary  of $94,700, about $5,000 over the listed salary. Benefits include three weeks  of vacation and an expense account of $400 each month.  </P> <P> School board President Jeff Holstien explained the higher salary offer as "the  amount of dollars needed to get Mr. Donoghue to leave a rather comfortable  position in Pomona where he had everything under control to come into a  district where, I would say, things are in a bit of a disarray financially.  </P> <P> "The district has to allocate dollars to bring in top-notch people who can  bring this district back where it belongs," he said.  </P> <P> Orange Unified has been beset by financial instability and charges of fiscal  mismanagement in recent years.  </P> <P> Holstien said Donoghue had an "excellent reputation" in the San Gabriel Valley.  </P> <P> "He gets things done, he solves problems and he does so in a  non-confrontational manner," Holstien said. Donoghue's predecessor, Perry, was  highly critical of board policies and resigned.  </P> <P> Donoghue said about a year ago that a mutual friend introduced him to the  Orange Unified's newly appointed superintendent, Norman Guith.  </P> <P> "Since I knew the superintendent I thought we might be able to make a  difference," Donoghue said. "We seem to be on the same philosophical page."  </P> <P> "Orange did not get into trouble overnight and its problems can't be solved  overnight," Donoghue said. "It's like the guy who asked, 'How do you eat an  elephant?' . . . One bite at a time."  </P> <P> Donoghue will join Orange Unified immediately on a part-time basis and will  begin full-time duties about the first of next month.  </P> <P> The Pomona school district serves about 26,500 students, comparable to Orange  Unified's enrollment of about 24,000. Both districts have budgets of about $105  million.  </P> <P> Donoghue was assistant superintendent of business services for the East  Whittier City School District from 1977 to 1984.  </P> <P> He received a master's degree in education from the University of Southern  California in 1974.  </P> <P> Donoghue, 45, came to California from Washington in 1959. He and his wife  Melody live in Arcadia with their three children. MARY HELEN BERG  </P></p>

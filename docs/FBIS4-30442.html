			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The 4 June edition of MATICHON on page  4 carried a report quoting Battambang Deputy Governor Serei  Kosal as saying that government forces are capable of driving  the Khmer Rouge [KR] out of Battambang Province. He noted that  government forces--spearheaded by paramilitary police--had  driven the Khmer Rouge out of Svay Sa, 60 kilometers south of  Battambang. Kosal also said that "if government forces are  given the order to retake Pailin, they could do so within two  days." He added that government units are being reinforced,  noting that Khmer Rouge strength around Pailin has been  exaggerated and that the Khmer Rouge had lost 300 troops in  their recapture of Pailin in April.</p>

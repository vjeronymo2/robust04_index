			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>   [Text] Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas declared  that his republic decided to seek membership in NATO least of  all because it wants to separate itself from Russia by "an iron  curtain."    "We have not set such a task and are ready to live in  friendship and mutual understanding with Russia, Belarus, and  other CIS states," Brazauskas stressed in an exclusive interview  with Interfax.    Commenting on a recent statement by the Russian President's  Spokesman, Vyacheslav Kostikov (who was puzzled by such a hasty  step of the Lithuanian leadership and warned that "the expansion  of NATO to include the countries situated close to Russia's  borders can in the long run lead to military and political  instability in the region so important for the fates of peace"),  Brazauskas said that Vilnius would stay away from polemics with  Moscow on the issue. Noting that Kostikov's statement was taken  into account, the president called for careful analysis of  Lithuania's decision to understand it properly.    "In our step, there is no element of confrontation with  Russia or an attempt to organize confrontation along with other  Baltic states," Brazauskas stressed.    He reported that he had addressed to NATO's Secretary  General  Manfred Woerner an application for membership after consulting  all Seimas (parliament) factions, which backed up the move. "I  must respect the parliament's view," he said.    Brazauskas warned against making a big stir of Lithuania's  decision to send an official letter to Woerner. "We realize  that such an application cannot be approved in Brussels soon or  as an exception. Writing a letter to NATO today and expecting  it to grant membership tomorrow would be naive," he noted.    The president welcomed the "Partnership for Peace" concept,  endorsed at NATO's summit in Brussels earlier this month and  stressed that through it Vilnius was going to promote  cooperation with the alliance.    He disagreed with those who fear that the success of  nationalists at the elections in Russia on December 12 was the  decisive factor that prompted Lithuania's application to NATO.  He recalled that Vilnius had taken the first steps in this  direction as early as the beginning of last year.    "I do not see in our step any demonstration and desire to  isolate ourselves. We are neighbors with Russia and we'll live  side by side, all the more so since there is a unique situation  with the Kaliningrad region of Russia," Brazauskas said.  Although the region borders with Lithuania and Poland, it has  no common border with the main territory of Russia.    "It is conceivable that a collective security system should  cover the whole of Europe, and it seems to me that all states,  Russia included, should come to realize that. All of us want  peace rather than confrontation on the European continent," the  Lithuanian president noted.    In his words, Lithuania's attitude towards Russia remains  unchanged, "and we hope that Moscow will not change towards  Vilnius either," Brazauskas said.    At the same time, he warned that if the Russian leadership  fundamentally changed and so did its policy in the Baltic  states, Vilnius would have to correct its actions.</p>

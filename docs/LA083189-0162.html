			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> TOWN CLOSES CITY HALL TO KICK THE RATS OUT  </P> <P> Exterminators have begun an attack on City Hall in their war to rid the  building's basement of rats, mice, fleas and squirrels.  </P> <P> Building inspector Tom Harmon declared the building in this resort community  unfit for occupation Monday because of the rodent and parasite population and  ordered it closed. It was to remain closed until this morning.  </P> <P> Lake Ozark Mayor Rick Moss said he saw the action as a positive step toward  cleaning up the city.  </P> <P> "And if that means shutting down City Hall, we're going to do it," Moss said.  </P> <P> In April, the City Council passed a dangerous buildings ordinance and hired  Harmon as part-time inspector.  </P></p>

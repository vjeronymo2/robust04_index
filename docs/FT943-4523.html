			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Nurdin puts expansion plans on back burner Nurdin &amp; Peacock, the cash and carry group, has put plans to expand its warehouse clubs on hold until the government's approach to out of town developments becomes clearer. The group made the announcement as it revealed a sharp drop in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 7.07m to Pounds 2.08m, after exceptional charges of Pounds 5.2m. Sales were 1 per cent ahead at Pounds 685m for the 26 weeks to July 1. The company, which has three Cargo Clubs either trading or under construction, said it was unlikely to open any clubs next year because the government had decided to review planning permission granted to its Stockport site, near Manchester. N&amp;P did not expect a resolution of the review before the spring. The warehouse club concept is a key part of N&amp;P's plan to reduce its dependence on the hard-pressed independent retailing sector. However, the strategy could be hit by the government's campaign to curb the explosion of out of town developments. Mr Nigel Hall, Nurdin's finance director, said it was 'very difficult to say whether we will win the review.' It was not clear why the DoE had chosen Stockport over N&amp;P's planned club in Bristol, he said. Nurdin's warehouse concept has run into further controversy with the group last week referring Sony to the European Union over restricted supplies of electrical goods to its clubs. Apart from such issues, Mr Hall said the warehouse clubs were proving successful. The first club at Croydon had 40,000 members and both visits and spending per customer had increased. Development of the Cargo Clubs cost N&amp;P Pounds 2.2m in exceptional charges in the first half, and was expected to incur further charges of Pounds 4m. The conversion of N&amp;P's traditional cash and carry businesses into Trade and Business Warehouses serving caterers, businesses and independent retailers was now complete, and had resulted in almost Pounds 3m in exceptional charges. Marketing the concept would cost a further Pounds 1.5m in the second half. The M6 cash and carry chain acquired in May contributed Pounds 26m in sales, but incurred losses. N&amp;P expected it to make further losses this year, including costs of Pounds 1m, but contribute substantially to profits next year. The dividend is increased to 2.16p (2.06p). Earnings fell by 54 per cent to 1.77p. Analysts said the underlying results, which showed a marginal increase in profits, were good considering the continuing pressures on N&amp;P's main customers. Full-year forecasts were for a sharp drop in profits from Pounds 32m to between Pounds 22m and Pounds 25m, after exceptionals.</p>

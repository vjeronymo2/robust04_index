Makes you wonder what our young  men are up against down there" (Part A, Dec. 31). This from a man who sent  24,000 soldiers, armed with the most advanced killing tools, to a foreign  country, which primarily accomplished the killing of Panamanians.  </P> <P> This is kinder and gentler? It sounds like something Adolph Hitler might have  said when he sent his troops to Czechoslovakia.  </P> <P> RICHARD F. GETZ  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

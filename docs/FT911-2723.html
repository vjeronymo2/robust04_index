			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Property sector lower Land Securities led most of the property sector lower after pessimistic forecasts on property prices were published by Richard Ellis, the chartered surveyor, and as BZW told clients to switch out of many sector leaders. Richard Ellis forecast that for the 12 months to the end of January 1992, the index of all property prices would fall 12 per cent. Offices would be the hardest hit, down 22 per cent, and shops, 5 per cent lower, would be least troubled. Rents would also suffer across the board. BZW said investors should avoid companies heavily exposed to office property. As well as Land Securities, down 14 to 515p, the broker identified MEPC, 8 off at 524p, Greycoat, 2 easier at 338p and Great Portland Estates, 6 lower at 220p. Trafalgar firm Trafalgar House stood out among the FT-SE stocks, being bought ahead of the interim results, due on May 8. One brokerage was a keen buyer earlier in the week after upgrading the stock and was joined yesterday by another equally determined house. Both were believed to be assuming that payment of the 8.8p per share interim dividend would be maintained, leaving the stock on a generous yield. There was also talk of attractive break-up values if the group did decide to hive off two of its three main trading divisions. These consist of property investment, construction and engineering, and shipping and hotels. Against the wider market, the shares rose 8 to 254p on turnover of 3.6m. Composites lower Composite insurers were weaker after a securities house lowered its profits forecasts for most of the big stocks in the sector. Increased competition among composites has gradually eroded profitability. The effect of this started to be felt in first quarter and by the year end County NatWest is forecasting that some of the leaders will report losses. County has cut its 1991 forecast for Commercial Union to zero from a previous estimate of a Pounds 50m profit; a loss of Pounds 95m against no profits is expected by General Accident; while Royal Insurance is forecast to make a Pounds 90m loss against Pounds 25m previously. CU closed 9 lower at 499p, General Accident eased 5 to 519p and Royal Insurance slipped 10 to 432p. McAlpine cash call Another rights issue found the building sector distinctly edgy. The deluge of cash calls, 16 so far this year, continued when Alfred McAlpine called for Pounds 38.8m to reduce borrowings of around Pounds 80m. The shares dipped amid claims that the proposed funding was 'a mercy call' but Mr Graeme Odgers, recently-appointed chief executive, denied this, saying 'there is too much money going out of the group by way of interest payments'. Analysts tended to agree with both his views and strategy, They stressed, however, the benefits were not going to come through quickly and thought the shares in the meantime could be caught up in the sector's weakness. They fell 28 yesterday to 258p. The rights issue will strengthen McAlpine's ties with Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez. The French group is buying some of the rights entitlement of the McAlpine Family Trusts and will emerge with a shareholding of 12 per cent. BTR bucked the market trend with a rise of 3 to 384p. Smith New Court recommended the stock, saying that the company's good margins at the bottom of the recession bode well for profits in any recovery. There was no stopping Maxwell Communication, up 10 to 237p. US securities house Goldman Sachs remained a determined buyer of the stock in spite of a profits warning from the company during the week. The Water Package bounced as Smith New Court said the recent fall was overdone. 'Even a disastrous result for the government in next week's local elections is in the price,' said Mr Steven Doe at Smith. The Labour Party has said it would renationalise the water companies, although Mr Doe belives that such would be the regulatory controls on other privatised industries that water would not have a singularly high political risk. The package was more than Pounds 100 better at one point and ended at Pounds 2955, up Pounds 85 on the day. Individual water stocks followed suit. The best performer was Thames, 8 higher at 306p. In a quiet oil and gas sector, the only busy trading was in British Gas. The shares eased 3 1/2 to 244 1/2 p as 7m changed hands. Analysts are to attend a presentation on Monday to hear the long-awaited results of a review of British Gas pricing by the government regulatory body Ofgas. The talk yesterday was that the new formula would specify that price rises should be kept to Retail Prices Index minus 5, compared with the current figure of RPI-2. There could also be firmer controls over how much British Gas could pass on higher gas costs to customers. 'This would be a tighter regime than expected,' said Mr Steve Turner of Smith New Court. Volume in diversified engineer Dowty rose to an unusually high 3.3m shares. SG Warburg was a persistent bidder of the stock. The price ended unchanged at 184p. Guinness Mahon, the merchant bank in which the Bank of Yokohama has a 65 per cent stake, was unchanged at 45p after it made a Pounds 49.3m rights issue. A cash call had been anticipated. The market was not troubled by the announcement of a Pounds 35m interim loss against a profit of Pounds 2m last time. The shares were buoyed by the Bank of Yokohama's decision to supply a Pounds 30m bridging loan to strengthen its capital base. National Home Loans weakened following a fall in interim profits to Pounds 10.1m from Pounds 15.6m last time and on the announcement that it had made a provision of Pounds 3.5m in its accounts against allegedly fraudulent activity at one of its consumer finance subsidiaries. The shares were 5 lower at 129p but a positive statement from Mr John Darby, the chairman, pushed NHL back to 133p, down a penny on the day. British Airways rose 4 to 168p as 3.2m changed hands on US buying following the recent rally in North American airline stocks. Anecdotal evidence of increased passenger demand also buoyed the shares. Albert Fisher added 4 at 121p after a series of presentations to Scottish institutions. Funding worries again beset ECC, the industrials materials group. Despite the assurances given earlier this week that a rights issue was not a consideration, the stock closed 8 down at 412p. Y J Lovell was subdued by advice not to take up the new nil-paid shares resulting from the rights issue. BZW told clients the cash call coupled with a second batch of above and below the line write-offs in property and waterside residential developments within the past 10 months was certainly asking a lot of Lovell's already long-suffering shareholders. The shares made no attempt to regain Thursday's sharp fall and closed easier at 143p, for a two-day loss of 35. John Mowlem was quoted ex the rights issue at 280p with the new nil-paid shares at 16p premium, after having opened at 28p premium. Graham Wood dipped 12 to 90p as the market became unreceptive to small sales. A sell recommendation in a weekly investment magazine left property and motor distribution company Wyndham 11 down at 7p.

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Consultancy to assist in restructuring and privatising Chinese state-owned industries under discussion A consultancy which would assist in restructuring and privatising Chinese state-owned industries is under discussion by the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank arm specialising in private sector finance, writes Alexander Nicoll. Sir William Ryrie, the IFC's executive vice-president, said in London yesterday that it had been asked to study the idea by Zhu Rongji, the vice-premier who oversees China's economic reform programme. China's bloated and inefficient state-owned industries are a serious obstacle to its drive for a market economy. The consultancy would examine all issues connected with revitalising the industries, including management, pricing policies and accounting. The IFC is discussing the concept with western accounting and consulting firms.</p>

			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / Drive begins to end war in Mozambique THE biggest effort yet to solve poverty-stricken Mozambique's 16-year civil war gets under way in Rome today where President Joaquim Chissano is due to meet his rebel opponent for the first face-to-face peace talks. Observers say there is a new-found sense of realism on both sides at the talks, born of a recognition that Mozambique and its 15m people simply cannot take another year of fighting, famine and destruction. The success of the talks is critical to averting widespread starvation caused by the worst drought in Mozambique's history but exacerbated by the war which has made 70 per cent of the country insecure, and has forced at least 4m people to flee their homes. The outcome of the talks is also vital to efforts to resuscitate Mozambique's aid-dependent economy where average per capita income is less than Dollars 80 and where Mr Chissano says half the country's people cannot feed themselves. Hopes are high that after two years of failed talks, the warring sides, tired by fighting and the suffering inflicted on their people, may now be prepared to reach agreement. The optimism is boosted by the involvement in the talks of President Mugabe of Zimbabwe and the foreign ministers of Italy and Botswana. A critical role is also being played behind the scenes by the European Community, the United Nations and Mr Tiny Rowland, the chief executive of Lonrho, which has substantial but unfulfilled agro-industrial commercial interests in Mozambique. However, the same nagging obstacles which have defeated eleven rounds of peace talks held over the past two years remain as formidable as ever. Renamo, the right-wing rebel group led by Mr Afonso Dhlakama, has little in the way of a political programme to present as a basis of dialogue. It was originally formed and supported by the Rhodesian secret service in 1974 to combat the communist black nationalist Frelimo party, which swept to power in Mozambique a year later. After Zimbabwean independence in 1980, South Africa continued the military and logistical support of Renamo as part of its destabilisation and sabotage campaign in hostile neighbouring states. Throughout this period, Renamo never tried to build a mass popular base, like other rebel insurgencies, but adopted tactics of sabotage and terrorism against civilians. The end of the Cold War, the abandonment of communism by Frelimo and introduction of liberal political and economic reforms followed by the changes in South Africa have left Renamo an anachronism. However, now backed by right-wing extremists in Portugal and South Africa, it has continued its campaign of terror and destruction. Fears are also widespread that one of the reasons Mr Dhlakama has been reluctant to speed the peace process is that he may not exercise control over his troops, many of whom are no more than marauding bandits. Efforts to reach a successful ceasefire between the two sides as a prelude to political dialogue has broken down over Renamo's demand that the Frelimo government withdraw an estimated 5,000-7,000 Zimbabwean troops stationed in Mozambique to guard trade routes and an oil pipeline between the two countries.</p>

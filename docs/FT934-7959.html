			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Telecoms groups to step up outsourcing THE BID by European telecommunications operators to develop a large-scale business from 'outsourcing' the telecoms needs of multinational companies intensified this week with the European Commission's clearance of a joint venture to service the international financial services market. The Financial Network Association, a venture company between 12 national public telecommunications operators, six of them European, was cleared by the Commission on condition that its services were not cross-subsidised by revenue from monopoly operations. The FNA is the latest of a succession of joint ventures in the last two years intended to tap the international outsourcing market. Europe now has at least four alliances targeted at the market, with AT&amp;T, the US giant, set to launch its 'Worldsource' outsourcing venture in Europe next year. The European participants in FNA are Mercury, the UK subsidiary of Cable &amp; Wireless, Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom, Belgacom of Belgium, Telefonica of Spain and Italcable of Italy. Other members include MCI, the second largest US long distance carrier, KDD of Japan and Telstra of Australia. The company will be offering specialised international network services to the financial sector, in particular high-capacity networks for the conveyance of data and image. Mr David Bland, FNA's general manager, said: 'We will be providing connectivity, and a seamless service, to a market under-provided for at the moment.' The alliance will be offering 'managed bandwidth' for services largely designed by the users. The FNA faces strong competition not only from other outsourcing ventures, but also from Swift, the body jointly owned by international banks to manage their main network functions. The FNA reflects the growing complexity of international telecommunications alliances. All of its members also belong to others alliances, some of which are competing with fellow members. MCI, the US long-distance carrier, formed a joint venture this summer with BT, with whom Mercury competes in the UK; while Mercury's parent, Cable &amp; Wireless, has a 24.5 per cent stake in Optus, the main competitor to Telstra in Australia. 'Technology transfer is a very complex issue - the agreements run to nearly 100 pages,' says Mr Bland, who is also an MCI executive. The size of the outsourcing market is unclear. Financial institutions are among the highest corporate spenders on telecoms, but they have sophisticated networks and managers of their own. Mr Ian Moore, director of the financial services group of the UK Telecommunications Managers' Association, said: 'I don't believe there is going to be much of an outsourcing requirement. 'For truly international institutions, telecommunications are strategic; for the rest, their international requirements are minimal.' Mr Bland said FNA had received expressions of interest from 'several very large companies', but declined to name them.</p>

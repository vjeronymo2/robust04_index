A flurry of visits to and from  Washington in the near future are expected to produce a fresh  bout of nuclear activism. Ms. Robin Raphel's visit to New Delhi  is only a prelude to higher level exchanges between India,  Pakistan and the U.S.    While the Clinton Administration is beginning to flex its  muscles to get New Delhi and Islamabad into a nuclear  nonproliferation embrace, the operational element of this  strategy unfortunately continues to rely upon flawed logic. By  reviving the planes-for- non-proliferation strategy, Washington  hopes to give its overall nuclear nonproliferation goals a  significant boost. In the past few weeks, the Administration  has been seeking to manoeuvre past strong Congressional opinion  by using the supply of stranded F-16 planes to Pakistan, on a  one-time exception basis, to induce a capping of Pakistan's  clandestine nuclear weapons programme. Such a move, apart from  the hydraheaded implications for the subcontinent, is fraught  with expected risks of failure.    Through the 1980's, the Reagan Administration's guns for  influence policy produced no tangible results on the nuclear  front for Washington. Despite soaking up nearly $10 billion in  economic- cum-military assistance, Islamabad's bellicosity  towards its eastern neighbour remained acute. Neither did the  drive towards acquiring a nuclear weapon capability slow down.  To the contrary, Islamabad was convinced that the guns for  influence policy may have been intended for its nuclear  programme but, in effect, it held a virtual veto, because of the  anticipation of Washington's policies whose real thrust was to  keep open the channels of communication with the Afghan  Mojahedin. Having cooperated with the CIA, the military regime  in Islamabad was given a virtual free hand to procure critical  parts for the bomb from the West. Over all, this policy only  produced a feverish arms race in the subcontinent.    With Afghanistan removed from its strategic "concerns",  Washington realised that Islamabad and the Generals had pulled  wool over its eyes through the entire period of the Afghan  resistance. It acted belated in deciding that the Pakistan  nuclear establishment had crossed the "red light", which  warranted them to stop economic and military aid, halfway  through the second phase of the assistance programme. President  Bush's inability to provide the waiver certificate in October  1990 automatically brought forth the provisions of the Pressler  Amendment.    The decision to seek the repeal of the Pressler Amendment  has  been a stated objective of the Clinton Administration. But its  attempts to re-write the Freedom Assistance Act without a  country specific language have not been acceptable to U.S.  lawmakers. Without the requisite votes, the Clinton  Administration publicly forwarded a draft that retained the  language of the Pressler Amendment. But privately it has been  pursuing an innovative track in diplomacy. The Grand Strategy  that has been crafted by the South Asia Department in Foggy  Bottom is to maximize the leverage that Washington has with  Islamabad, New Delhi and Congress over the Pressler Amendment.    It is no secret that the supply of the stranded 71 F-16's  has  become the focal point of the dispute between Islamabad and  Washington. The F-16's, apart from their operational  versatility, have come to symbolise the tenuous nature of their  bilateral relations. In another context, the F-16 represents  the jagged edge of a bitter and costly arms race between India  and Pakistan. Within Pakistan, the supply of the aircraft has  been projected in popular perception as the test case of  America's "loyalty" to Islamabad's outstretched hand of  friendship and assistance. With the stakes getting higher on  the issue of the delivery of the F-16's, Washington's mandarins  including Ms. Raphel have conceived of a strategy that seeks to  develop sufficient leverage over Islamabad by sending signals  that it is prepared to work for the release of the F-16 for a  price. This bounty, it is generally assumed, is to seek to cap  the nuclear weapon programme.    There are two broad interpretations of the proposed moves on  the South Asian chess board. One view looks upon the F-16  nuclear capping swap in purely bilateral terms, with New Delhi's  ability to steer clear of any linkages on New Delhi's nuclear  front. The resumed supply of F-16's, this view contends, will  spark a fresh round of purchases. Without a countervailing  external power capable of giving aircraft that match the large  dose of F-16's that Islamabad will receive, New Delhi may be  forced to look at other alternatives to restore the balance.  The second view looks at the proposed move in alarmist tones.  They perceive this decision by the Clinton Administration to  represent a "tilt" towards Islamabad, bringing back earlier  fears that Washington's Pakistan policy is being worked without  taking into account New Delhi's sensitivity.    There is, however, a need to look at the Administration's  attempt as part of a larger and more coordinated strategy than  is generally assumed. In both reports submitted to Congress for  FY 1992-93, the Administration has consistently singled out  nuclear non-proliferation as its highest priority item in South  Asia. The reports have also underlined the manner in which the  U.S. would want to proceed in achieving this goal. Washington  would first like to "cap" the programmes of the two countries  then "freeze" them followed by their "roll back". It is obvious  that they can achieve this only through simultaneous pressure  upon Islamabad and New Delhi.    Several credible news reports have outlined the course the  Clinton Administration would like to take. The one-time  exception is like dangling a carrot before the Benazir Bhutto  government seeking in return a formal announcement that its  nuclear programme has been capped. It is evident that  Washington will not merely accept Pakistani declarations, but  will seek inspections of nuclear facilities in Pakistan and  create inventories, thereby hoping to foreclose future  enrichment and its weapons development programme. The leverage  to make Islamabad bite the non-proliferation bait will be the  resumption of the F-16 fighters. Washington hopes that the  resumption of supply of these high visibility items will allow  Benazir a face-saving escape route because, technically,  Islamabad's weapon option would remain open while its future  capability would be severely hampered. In fact, the controversy  over nuclear capping that involved all major actors of the  troika having corroborated the decision to cap the programme,  albeit with totally differing motivations, could be part of a  long-term strategy of sensitising Pakistani public opinion to a  trend that Islamabad may have accepted as au fait.    A declaratory posture on nuclear capping would allow the  Administration to create sufficient grounds within Congress to  seek the repeal of the Pressler Amendment, allowing for  resumption of arms supplies to Pakistan. But it would be  inconceivable for Islamabad to accept such terms on a unilateral  basis. This is where the second element of Washington's nuclear  nonproliferation strategy for South Asia comes into play. The  Robin Raphel visit to New Delhi coincides with the visit of  General Abdul Waheed Kakar to Washington. The fact that the  much postponed visit by a Pakistan Army Chief is on, suggests  that the nuclear issue will be discussed with the man generally  presumed to be closest to the nuclear button. There is every  possibility that Ms. Raphel and Strobe Talbott, the Deputy  Secretary of State, scheduled to visit India some 10 days after  her, may carry a significant nonproliferation message for India.    New Delhi would no doubt come under severe pressure, if  Washington and Islamabad are able to agree upon this tandem  approach. While our nuclear disarmament policies have been  predicated upon a global approach, we have in the recent past  been persuaded to accept the validity of a regional construct,  not necessarily confined to South Asia. New Delhi cannot escape  the ramifications of the impending Pak-U.S. deal on the F-16's.    Pressure upon New Delhi notwithstanding, Washington's  aircraft-for-capping strategy can fall into a similar trap that  the Reagan and Bush Administrations had fallen into. Capping  will not remove Islamabad's clandestine bombs nor will it give  reliable information about how much fissile material Abdul Qadir  Khan's men would have stashed away elsewhere. Given Islamabad's  persistent attempts to link Kashmir with the fear of a  holocaust, Islamabad's declaratory posture needs to be accepted  with a pinch of salt. Washington may find that in the process  of capping nuclear programmes in South Asia, it has caused a  sprint towards overt nuclearisation.</p>

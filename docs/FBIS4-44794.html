The scheme, with a budget of DM499 million (around ECU257  million) up to 1999, finances fundamental research, basic  industrial research and applied research and development. The  aid is given in the form of outright grants.    Information technology is the science of recording,  processing, storing and transferring information using technical  resources. The aid measures under the information technology  programme 1994-99 focus on certain main areas:    -- software technology/reliable information systems    -- parallel high-performance computing    -- bioinformation technology    -- neuroinformation technology    -- knowledge processing (artificial intelligence)    -- telecooperation    Beneficiaries are enterprises and research institutes.    Projects supported may receive 100-percent gross when they  are considered to be fundamental research. The maximum aid  intensity amounts to 50 percent for projects of basic industrial  research and 25 percent for projects of applied research and  development. Enhancements are foreseen when projects are carried  out by SMEs [small and medium-sized enterprises] (plus 10  percentage points), in the former GDR (plus 10 percentage  points) or by SMEs in the ex-GDR (plsu 15 percentage points).    The Commission examined the notified programme in the  context  of the relevant treaty articles and the Community framework for  state aids for R&amp;D.    The programme respects the criteria laid down in the  above-mentioned framework and, consequently, the Commission  raised no objections under the application of article 92(3)(c)  of the EC-Treaty and article 61(3)(c) of the EEA-Treaty.</p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Competition role for Gatt urged THE strong role in drafting and enforcing international competition rules advocated for Gatt by Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, in Davos, Switzerland, yesterday, accords with current thinking in Gatt on its future role and concerns, Frances Williams reports from Geneva. Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, has said he believes its two most crucial issues in the next decade will be the link between trade and environment and an extension of international competition rules. A bigger role for Gatt in the competition field would follow a successful end to the Uruguay Round where, for the first time, international disciplines governing domestic policies and cross-border trade have been discussed. The draft 'final act' of the Uruguay Round envisages a Multilateral Trade Organisation (MTO) to administer Gatt and the proposed accords on services and intellectual property protection. This would come closer to an International Trade Organisation mooted in 1947 which as well as supervising Gatt would have had responsibilities for regulating international competition in restrictive business practices, investments and commodities.

Yasushi Akashi spoke in more detail about the  results of these talks at a news conference that he held in  Sarajevo this evening. Zoran Pirolic reports:    [Begin Pirolic recording] During a two-day visit in  Sarajevo, Yasushi Akashi met with the representatives of our  country's authorities, but also of the aggressor' side in Pale.  His impression after these talks put forward in Sarajevo  tonight is definitely interesting.    I was given assurances by both sides that they favor peace  and unhindered movement of humanitarian convoys, Akashi said.  This afternoon I was given firm assurances by Mr. Karadzic that  his side will fully observe the free use of Sarajevo airport.  He reiterated his devotion to the free movement of convoys, Mr.  Akashi added. This UN representative said that he had heard from  both sides -- the Bosnian authorities and the aggressor's side  -- that they favor multiethnic and multicultural life although  they differ a little in their views on the implementation of  this. After these, definitely unusual assessments, the UN  special envoy to former Yugoslavia was exposed to a real barrage  of often very unpleasant questions.    First of all, he was asked whether he believed Karadzic's  promises even though they had been made on numerous occasions  before and as a matter of rule subsequently broken. According to  Akashi, the entire problem lies in the line of command. Dr.  Karadzic admitted to him that the resolutions and declarations  had not been observed so far because of disobedient soldiers on  the ground, but that the line of command would be strengthen and  similar things would no longer recur.    Asked about the possibility of air strikes against the  Serbian aggressor, Mr. Akashi was at first surprised and then  asked what air strikes were. It seems that there is a great  confusion between air strikes and what we, in the UN, call air  support, Akashi said. The forces on the ground will resort to  this sort of protection only in the case of self-defense, Akashi  added.    Answering to a question whether the recent murderous  shelling  of Sarajevo, which lasted several days, was also one of the  incidents by disobedient soldiers, Akashi replied that elements  beyond control exist on all sides. He admitted that four UN  Protection Force experts confirmed that Karadzic's Serbs had  damaged the runway of Sarajevo airport, but added that he was  given firm assurances that this side would not obstruct the flow  of humanitarian aid.    Asked about the possibility of a military intervention in  Bosnia, Akashi said that this was a highly serious issue and  that the final decision on this will be passed by the UN  Security Council. However, I hope that we will never reach the  stage of passing a decision about a military intervention, he  said.    Asked to explain what is a close air support and how does it  differ from air strikes, Mr. Akashi said that the final decision  about this action lies in the hands of the UN Secretary General  and that it will be based on the assessments of the commanders  of the peace troops on the ground. The blue berets had, on  several occasions, drilled such an action, Akasi said, adding  that he hoped that there would be no need for its application.    General Francis Briquemont, commander of the UN peace troops  for Bosnia-Herzegovina, also attended the news conference.  Asked whether he had proposed air strikes he replied: I have  never uttered a word about air strikes or air support, never. I  said in August what I thought about this. The air support was  organized but I never demanded it. I am the only one who can  demand air protection, but I have never done this. I am not  upset by what is being said about this in New York, Paris,  Brussels, and Geneva. I have enough problems in Bosnia, General  Briquemont concluded. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Romanian ruling party faces test of unity ROMANIA'S RULING party, the National Salvation Front (NSF), faces a severe test of unity as it gathers today in Bucharest at the start of its annual convention. Open factions have developed within the NSF in recent weeks, following the party's poor showing in February's local elections. The NSF, which was returned to power in May 1990 with two-thirds of the vote, is now under pressure to resolve its problems ahead of general elections due this summer. At the heart of the party's troubles is a bitter rift between supporters of Mr Ion Iliescu, the president, and those favouring Mr Petre Roman, the former prime minister and NSF national leader. Mr Roman's reformist government was dismissed in September 1991 by Mr Iliescu following three days of miner-led strikes, but, until now, Mr Roman has managed to retain titular party leadership. But Mr Roman's position looks increasingly vulnerable and party sources say his support is diminishing. Depending on the outcome of the convention, he may even leave the NSF and form a new party. Earlier this week a parliamentary commission accused Mr Roman's government of misappropriating more than Dollars 120m from state funds in 1991. In a highly politicised report, the commission also alleged that Mr Roman's two cabinets had acted unprofessionally and had lacked accurate information about the country's economic situation. Mr Roman has strenuously denied the charges. He says the commission's accusations are unsubstantiated and designed to undermine his position before the NSF convention. Furthermore, Mr Roman has accused Mr Iliescu of 'behaving unconstitutionally' by involving himself in the NSF's internal affairs. The president, who was a founding member of the NSF in December 1989 following the overthrow of the Ceausescu regime, has held several meetings of party leaders in the past month. Under the Romanian constitution, the president is supposed to be above party politics.</p>

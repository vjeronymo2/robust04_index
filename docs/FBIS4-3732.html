			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 22 (XINHUA) -- The State Securities  Council (SSC) announced here today that it was going to ban  standardized futures contracts transactions in steel products  and sugar.    According to a notice from the SSC, no transactions in  standardized futures contracts for steel products and sugar will  be permitted after October this year.    But transactions in standardized futures contracts with a  delivery date before October 1994 will be allowed to continue  till completion.    Transactions in non-standardized futures contracts for steel  and sugar will be allowed to go on, but illegal operations will  be forbidden.    The notice suggests that the Chinese Ministry of Coal  Industry should issue a notice to stop listing standardized  futures contracts for coal products in all coal transaction  centers and wholesale markets.    The SSC notice says that no transaction centers have the  right to list new futures trade items, without first getting  approval from the China Securities Regulatory Committee (CSRC).    It also forbids any financial departments to provide futures  trade guarantee letters. The notice says that futures trade  centers should not accept such letters of guarantee or take them  as earnest money.    The SSC announces in the notice that the CSRC has the right  to order futures transaction centers to raise the earnest money  ratio whenever futures trade prices suffer sharp fluctuations.    According to incomplete statistics, there are now about 40  futures trade centers in China, of which 30 are in operation.</p>

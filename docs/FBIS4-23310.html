			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The stealing of arms and ammunition at the  National School of Noncommissioned Officers in Gamboma, Plateaux  Region, on the night of 28 May continues to be the topic of  discussion. The CONGOLESE NEWS AGENCY has published the full  list of the stolen arms and ammunition which is read here by  Jean-Jacques Adamou:    [Adamou] First, one should note that this is not the type of  robbery that can be easily forgotten. It is a (?major robbery).  According to the list released today, about 21,000 rounds of  ammunition of various caliber, 120 rockets, 475 offensive and  defensive grenades, 72 AK-rifles, 47 meters of explosive cord,  256 safety fuses, one box of TNT, one box of dynamite, 19  compasses, five aiming devices for RPG-7's, 13 TNT (?chains), 10  antitank rocket launchers, and 18 rifles, were stolen. The  large quantity of stolen weaponry gives rise to a myriad of  questions. [passage omitted] One wonders whether the robbers  did not benefit from complicity within the school. The least  one can say is that security is very loose at the cadet school.  [passage omitted]</p>

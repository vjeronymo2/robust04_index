			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Ready to ride out the storm: The UK's embattled prime minister, John Major, outlines his objectives to Richard Lambert and Philip Stephens Mr John Major is not giving up. His government lags further behind in the opinion polls than any other in post-war history. Sections of the Conservative party frequently seem bent on self-destruction. Mr Tony Blair is beginning to fashion an electable Labour party. But the prime minister intends to ride out the storm, to fight a general election he believes may well not take place until mid-1997. Speaking in the cabinet room at 10 Downing Street yesterday morning, Mr Major's mood was quiet, initially rather hesitant. But his message during a 45-minute conversation was unambiguous. He says he is not one of those politicians who bangs the table. He does not believe that to have convictions you have to take up extreme positions. But he has clear ambitions  - for the economy, for Northern Ireland, for a radical reshaping of public services to devolve power to individuals. He intends to see them through. Those in the Tory party who imagine that Mr Major might just get up and walk away should think again. Political recovery, he concedes, will depend on restoring party unity, as well as what the prime minister describes as 'the best economic recovery in living memory'. Last week's by-election defeat at the hands of Labour in Dudley West was 'a very poor result'. Although Tory in-fighting did not entirely explain the biggest swing from Conservative to Labour in 60 years, the lesson is: 'Firstly, the party must want to be united'. Mr Major warms to the theme: 'I think the Conservative party in the country would think it would be folly running off the Richter scale if the party were not to come together and unite behind the economic recovery.' But it cannot be peace on his enemies' terms. We turn to the position of the nine so-called Tory rebels, the Eurosceptic MPs suspended for defying the government in a vote on Britain's contributions to Brussels. Their treatment technically deprives Mr Major of his overall majority at Westminster, though on most issues he can rely on the nine Ulster Unionist MPs for support. The prime minister is unapologetic. It is self-evident that there was 'no choice' but to suspend them once the MPs withheld their support on a vote of confidence. The same principles apply to their possible return to the fold. The rebels are Conservatives and Mr Major hopes they will support the government in the months ahead: 'In due course one can consider whether they should be re-admitted to the party whip. But it is not imminent at all; they must show that they are in the business of supporting the government.' The use of the term 'months ahead' is not a slip. One of the things the rebels want is the promise of a referendum before Britain accepts any further European integration. Here Mr Major keeps the door firmly open. But first he insists on defining his broader attitude to Europe. Politicians across the parties are divided into three groups. The first two are at the extremes  - a minority that has never been reconciled to membership of the European Union and an equally small number who want a centralised, federal Europe. Then there is the third group in which Mr Major places himself and the broad mass of Conservatives. It does not question the economic advantages of membership of the EU. But it is equally sure Britain should not sign up for something just because it comes from Europe. This majority group wants Britain to shape Europe in a way that fits its own interests and instincts. As Mr Major puts it: 'I am as passionately opposed to a wholly federal Europe as I would be to Britain losing its membership of the European Union.' So will he offer a referendum? Not for narrow party political reasons. But yes, 'there conceivably could be reasons that would justify a referendum on certain issues and I am not going to rule them out'. Taking first the EU's Intergovernmental Conference planned for 1996, the prime minister says the fears of the Eurosceptics are almost certainly unfounded. The outcome of a conference that has not yet started is inevitably unpredictable. But: 'My strong suspicion is that we will see very little change of any serious nature, certainly no serious constitutional change'. The prime minister reinforces the point: 'I do not expect to come back with anything that would require a referendum'. But he admits he cannot be sure. Other EU leaders might bring more grandiose ambitions to the conference table. So the referendum option will be held in reserve. The case for a plebiscite on a single currency is more clear cut. Economic and monetary union would be a change of 'great national significance'. But Mr Major believes the timetable is more distant and is slipping. There is no question of eight EU countries meeting the Maastricht criteria required for a single currency in 1997. Only three countries, the UK among them, are likely to qualify. Theoretically, a core group might be ready to go ahead two years later in 1999, but Mr Major is far from certain that such a group would chose to, given the 'immensely divisive impact' on the EU. So in Mr Major's terms: 'I cannot be certain no one will move ahead in 1999 but I think those people who predict it with confidence are rather reckless in their predictions.' But as to the timing of any specific referendum pledge, Mr Major is keeping his counsel. Meanwhile, the cabinet will spend the next few months shaping Britain's agenda for the 1996 conference. No plans have been finalised, but slimming down the European Commission to cope with enlargement, the relationship between national and the European parliaments and issues such as subsidiarity and deregulation will be high on the agenda. So too will be a strengthening of the intergovernmental structure established at Maastricht, particularly in the area of security and foreign policy. There can be no question of Britain surrendering any sovereignty over its foreign policy, nor of any moves that would undercut the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato). But there is 'a range of areas where we can strengthen the European defence identity, strengthen the European pillar of Nato and ensure that the Europeans collectively make a greater contribution to the overall security'. The discussion moves on to the economy, a source of both pride and frustration for the prime minister. Mr Major  - like President Bill Clinton in the US  - is presiding over a voteless recovery. Inflation is low, growth and exports are buoyant, but there is still barely a hint of a political payback. Mr Major suggests the biggest obstacle to the return of confidence is that unemployment hit a different sector of the community during the last recession. 'The bruising has gone unusually deep.' Those in white-collar professions such as financial services had previously been insulated from downturns. This time, their next-door neighbours have been among the victims. More broadly: 'The economy is doing extremely well but people aren't' Annual growth is running at 4 per cent but most individuals have not seen a rise in their net disposable income. The reason is that the vast bulk of the extra growth has been absorbed by investment rather than by wages and dividends: 'That is very good for the economy as a whole. It is very good for employment . . . but it doesn't impact on the person who says, 'I see the politicians tell me the economy is getting better, I don't feel any better off in my own lifestyle'.' We put it to Mr Major that many in his party had a simple answer. Now that borrowing was under control, the government could fill the voters' pockets with tax cuts. Was Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, being altogether too austere in his warnings about fiscal prudence? The prime minister insists not. 'I am with the chancellor 100 per cent. We are not going to engineer a pre-election boom. That is not the game we are playing at all. Everyone has gone through a great deal of pain and a great deal of difficulty to put this economy on an even keel . . . If anybody thinks we will recklessly throw that away then they are making a very serious misjudgement indeed.' Tax cuts will come when the economic conditions are right: 'I do wish to put taxes down, I do wish to give people choice but I am not going to do it until it is economically right to do it'. But what about those company directors who have engineered their own private economic boom with hefty salary increases and share option packages? The electorate, to judge by the opinion polls, is appalled. Is Mr Major going to act? Some of the increases, the prime minister agrees, have been 'insensitive'. He welcomes moves in the City towards a greater degree of self-regulation. He has held discussions on the issue with the Institute of Directors and the National Association of Pension Funds. But in legislative terms there is little he can do: 'The danger of government taking legislative action of some sort is that you in practice then impose a rather restricted pay policy upon a small number of people'. His comments leave the impression that Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary and a fierce opponent of intervention, has prevailed in the cabinet debate on the issue. There is time just at the end of the interview to look ahead. To the question whether he can remain prime minister until the end of the present parliamentary term in mid-1997, Mr Major answers a simple 'Yes'. And he intends to: 'You sometimes have to tack and trim to get from Dover to some far distant port, but providing you get to the port a bit of tacking and a bit of trimming en route doesn't matter'.</p>

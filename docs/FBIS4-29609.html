			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- Chief Cabinet Secretary  Hiroshi Kumagai called on members of prime minister Tsutomu  Hata's cabinet on Friday [17 June] to limit their fundraising  activities, officials said.    The request came as Home Affairs Minister Hajime Ishii, of  the key coalition party Shinseito, was preparing to hold a  seminar on Sunday in Kobe for a fee of 20,000 yen per  participant.    Ishii insisted that he will go ahead with the seminar,  arguing, "It's not a fundraising party but a study session."    Organizers expect about 1,000 people to attend the seminar,  at which Construction Minister Koji Morimoto and Economic  Planning Agency chief Toshio Terasawa will deliver speeches.    Kumagai, also a member of Shinseito, has repeatedly urged  Ishii to drop the plan. Ishii says the seminar was planned  before he became home affairs minister in late April.</p>

This  was stated by party Secretary General Do Muoi at the reception  given in honor of visiting Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina  Gonzalez in Hanoi. The Cuban foreign minister was received by  Vietnamese leaders, who all reaffirmed the Vietnam's unchanged  support for Cuban people and government in their efforts to  overcome present difficulties and their successful carrying out  of the national construction and defense.    Vietnam and Cuba have an age-old traditional relationship.  Vietnamese people appreciate the Cuban party, government, and  people for their long solidarity, strong support, and general  assistance to the Vietnamese people's revolution. The visit to  Cuba by the Vietnamese party and government delegation led by  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet in July last year was a new step in  bilateral relations between Vietnam and Cuba.    Speaking with the newspaper QUAN DOI NHAN DAN, or Army  paper,  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet said: The Vietnamese people will  never forget the support and assistance reserved for Vietnam by  the Cuban people during the years of the anti-U.S war for  national salvation. With the spirit for Vietnam, Cuba was  prepared to donate even their own blood. Vietnamese people deem  it their obligation and responsibility to share with Cuban  people all wealth and woes, especially in the current difficult  time for Cuba.    During the Cuba visit last year, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet  reached an agreement where Vietnam is providing Cuba with 10  million tons [figure as heard] of rice annually. Vietnam also  offers to share experiences with Cuban people on its renovation  process. At present, Vietnam and Cuba have strengthened  comprehensive cooperation, especially in education, health,  transport and communication, and agriculture.    The visit to Vietnam by Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto  Gonzalez will help further consolidate the fraternity and mutual  cooperation between Vietnam and Cuba. Before leaving Hanoi on  23 March, the Cuban foreign minister told a press conference:    [Begin Robaina recording in Spanish fading into English  translation] My visit to Vietnam this time is very special and  comes with satisfactory results.

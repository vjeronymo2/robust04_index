			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar eases on profit-taking TRADING was quiet on the foreign exchanges as much of northern Europe celebrated Ascension Day. The dollar drifted down on profit-taking after Wednesday's strong performance. Modestly encouraging US weekly jobless claims data raised barely a flicker of interest. Jobless claims fell to a seven-month low of 403,000 from a revised 407,000 the week before. Forecasts had been for another rise to 408,000. Analysts said the figures were consistent with a rise in May non-farm payrolls of 100,000 or slightly more, and would therefore keep the Federal Reserve from further easing. By mid-afternoon the US unit had drifted down about  3/4 pfennig to DM1.6275, after Wednesday's close of DM1.6345. The softening of the US currency also followed rumours that the Bank of Japan had been intervening to steady the yen. A trader said he suspected that the BoJ intervened in Tokyo over night but doubted that it had carried on into European trading. At the Tokyo close the dollar stood at Y129.92 and DM1.6340. It ended in Europe at Y129.50 and DM1.6265. In the US the dollar finished around the London levels, trading subdued by a quiet domestic news background and the European holiday. It finally stood at DM1.6270 and Y129.50, down from opening New York levels of DM1.6310 and Y129.85. Traders were waiting for the M2 measure of the money supply, which was expected to show a fall of Dollars 3.7bn compared with a rise of Dollars 5.4bn the previous week. A drop in M2 of Dollars 5bn or more would take annual growth back below the floor of the Federal Reserve's 2.5 to 5.5 per cent target range and keep fears of another easing alive, analysts said. The pound remained subdued in the quiet market. Traders said the slight retreat in the dollar had helped the D-Mark at sterling's expense, and there were also signs that the pound was being sold for French francs following news on Wednesday that the French trade surplus jumped to a record FFr7.79bn in April from FFr1.06bn the month before. The peseta survived a half-day general strike relatively unscathed. Spanish officials and businesses dismissed the effect of the strike but unions believed it would force a change of heart on controversial labour reforms. Economy minister Mr Carlos Solchaga plans to accelerate liberalisation of the Spanish economy in order to meet European economic and monetary union convergence requirements. The Spanish currency closed at Pta183.10 against the pound, compared with Wednesday's finish of Pta183.40. Dealers warned that trading in Europe was likely to stay quiet for the rest of the week.</p>

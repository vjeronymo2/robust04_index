			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Selling pressure moves to drug stocks Wall Street A SELL-OFF in drug stocks left Wall Street in the doldrums yesterday afternoon, with volume bloated by the afternoon's triple-witching expiration of options and futures on stock indices, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average struggled to post gains briefly in the afternoon after a depressed morning but it was hit by triple-witching related selling which contributed to a drop of 27.12 to 3,494.77. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 4.86 at 443.68, while the Amex composite was 0.57 lower at 436.82 and the Nasdaq composite fell 6.35 to 689.59. Triple witching trading swelled volume on the NYSE. More than 294m shares changed hands on the day, with turnover of more than 120m shares by 11am. Declines outnumbered rises by 1,217 to 691. Investor confidence in drug stocks was shaken by a number of ratings downgrades yesterday morning. Kidder Peabody cut its investment rating on Merck, Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb, and the respective stocks dropped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 37, Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 72 1/4 , and Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 59 5/8 . Shares in Johnson &amp; Johnson, which was downgraded by Harris Upham, fell Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 42 7/8 . Litton Industries shares soared Dollars 8 1/8 to record high of Dollars 65 1/8 in very heavy trading after the company said that it would establish an independent commercial company which will include Litton's oil field information services and industrial automation units. Litton Industries will remain an aerospace and defense company. The tax-free transaction is expected to be completed by the end of this year. Airline stocks turned higher after taking a beating earlier this week. AMR, parent of American Airlines, rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 62 1/2 after dropping Dollars 4 1/2 a day earlier when the company said that its second quarter earnings would be significantly below analysts expectations. USAir, which issued its own profits warning on Wednesday, regained Dollars 1/4 to Dollars 16 1/4 , and UAL, parent of United, firmed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 122 5/8 , but Delta edged Dollars  1/8 lower to Dollars 48. The sector's improvement contributed to gains in the Dow Jones Transportation Average, which was up 3.78 to 1,495.30 On the Nasdaq market, technology issues moved broadly lower with Microsoft down Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 87 1/2 , Apple Computer off Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 41. Lotus Development held steady at Dollars 35. Integrated Circuit Systems, which designs and manufactures integrated circuits, plunged Dollars 4 1/8 to Dollars 13 3/4 after Prudential Securities cut its rating on the stock to 'hold' from 'buy'. Canada TORONTO share prices ended little changed in active trading. Based on preliminary figures, the TSE-300 index was up 3.23 points at 3,906.94, for a gain on the week of about 41 points. Advances led declines 391 to 323. Volume of 66.72m shares was above Thursday's 61.64m shares. Trading value rose to CDollars 912m from CDollars 639m.</p>

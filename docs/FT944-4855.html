			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Vote for Tanzanian PM Tanzania's national assembly yesterday endorsed by 165 votes to 42 the appointment of Mr Cleopa Msuya, former industry and trade minister, as prime minister by President Ali Hassan Mwinyi. Mr Mwinyi, under fire from international donors over a tax-evasion scandal, named Mr Msuya to succeed John Malecela as first vice president and prime minister after dissolving his cabinet on Sunday. Mr Mwinyi is under pressure from western donors who provide annual aid of Dollars 800m to sack Finance Minister Kighoma Malima over charges he failed to supervise efficient collection of taxes.</p>

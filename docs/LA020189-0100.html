			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASTE INCINERATOR DISPUTE PUT ON HOLD  </P> <P> The dispute over whether the state's first full-scale commercial hazardous  waste incinerator can be built in Vernon without an environmental impact study  was put on hold Tuesday pending a hearing March 28.  </P> <P> The South Coast Air Quality Management District, which had said it would not  renew previously granted construction permits expiring today, agreed to extend  those permits until the hearing date set by Superior Court Judge Dzintra  Janavs.  </P> <P> California Thermal Treatment Service agreed to take no new action toward  construction of the incinerator in the meantime.  </P> <P> Tuesday's hearing was on the company's application for a temporary restraining  order to prevent the AQMD from failing to renew the permits it originally  issued with the declaration that a full-scale environmental study was not  necessary.  </P> <P> The city of Los Angeles and various environmental groups have protested the  lack of an environmental impact study, however, and in December the AQMD  reversed itself, informing the company that the permits would not be renewed  without a study and tougher emission controls.  </P></p>

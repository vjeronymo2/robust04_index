			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by M. Bunjac: "Smuggling as a Military Secret"] </F>   [Excerpts] Glina -- Military secrets often affect the fate  of people in various positions, people with different  professions, characters, affiliations, and intentions. The  curious want to find out what these secrets are, the traitors  want to reveal them, the strategists and military men want to  use them to achieve an advantage over their enemy. As of  recently, the Krajina's entire state and political leadership,  as well as the public, have also been dealing with a "military  secret."    Milka Ljubicic, editor in chief of SRPSKI GLAS, the only  Krajina newspaper, was banned from attending a political meeting  that was recently organized by RSK [republic of Serbian Krajina]  President Milan Martic. As was later explained at this informal  meeting, they discussed issues "important for the defense of  Krajina." In her earlier articles, Ljubicic had written  publicly about these issues. Therefore, she revealed a military  secret. This was in fact the reason for the open correspondence  between Borivoje Rasuo, minister of information in the Krajina  Government, and RSK President Milan Martic.  <H5>  Location of Corps' Command </H5>   The allegations about treason are formally based on Milka  Ljubicic's article in DUGA, entitled "Kilograms of Genuine DM  [German marks]," in which, writing about smuggling, crime, and  lawlessness in Krajina, Ljubicic also mentioned the location of  the Kordun Corps' Command, which is the vicinity of "Sentilj," a  well- known border area with the Cazin Krajina, an area in which  profiteers sell various articles ranging from foodstuffs to arms  of all calibers. Acting on the order of the Corps's commander,  the communal public prosecutor asked the Vrgin Most court to  conduct an investigation and file criminal charges against  Ljibicic for "revealing a military secret," that is, revealing  the location of the Corps' Command.    The contentious article was published in DUGA in August  1993.  Criminal charges were filed six months later, in February 1994.  As we have unofficially learned, after the initial  investigation, the communal court sent the case back to the  relevant public prosecutor for reviewing. The public prosecutor  now has to decide whether there are any grounds for further  criminal proceedings or not. This offense, committed in  wartime, carries a prison sentence of up to 15 years. [passage  omitted]  <H5>  Unsolved Murders </H5>   Supporting Borivij Rasuo, information minister in the RSK  government, the more serious analysts and those familiar with  the events in Krajina claim that this "case" has its own  background and causes on a completely different side. In a  series of articles in DUGA and SRPSKI GLAS, Milka Ljubicic  revealed to the last detail the channels for smuggling and war  profiteering in which both the current and former police,  military, and political leaderships of Krajina were involved.  In her article in SRPSKI GLAS, "Mile [Milan] Travels Through  the Corridor," written on the occasion of the first anniversary  of the corridor, the corridor is mentioned as a paradise for war  profiteers and a hell for those who opened it. This was the  first more serious tackling of the problem of illegal trade with  the Muslims, conducted by the political and business circles in  Belgrade, where certain individuals, considered to be social  "cases" until not so long ago, as well as members of certain  "structures," became millionaires overnight.    In the incriminating article that was published in DUGA last  year, Milka Ljubicic also mentioned several murders that have  remained unsolved to this date. They were committed in Banija  and Kordun and are often spoken about in connection with money  laundering, or claimed to have political motives, as is the case  of the late Dmitar Obradovic, president of the Vrgin Most  Communal Assembly. The real reasons for anathemizing this  journalist are purported to be her criticism of the Ministry of  Internal Affairs and the Headquarters of the Krajina Army for  the strange way in which they appropriated 760,000 German marks  at the Moscenica border crossing. Ljubicic continuously  insisted in her articles on the rule of law and criticized the  authorities for not doing anything to prevent the anarchy and  lawlessness that has taken deep roots in Krajina.</p>

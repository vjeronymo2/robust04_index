			<p>BFN     [Text] What do elite bureaucrats in "Kasumigaseki" think  about public criticism of government officials' practices? From  mid-March to 1 April, ASAHI SHIMBUN surveyed division  chief-class bureaucrats of the central government through  interviews or mailed questionnaires, and obtained 267 responses.  Regarding an opinion that "the nation's policymaking  authorities are concentrated to bureaucrats rather than  politicians," over 60 percent of division chiefs acknowledged  such tendencies. This presented great contrast with responses  from vice ministers, as 15 out of 21 vice ministers denied  "bureaucrat-led policymaking." In mailed questionnaires, we  also asked about bureaucrats' post-retirement jobs in the  industrial sectors under their control. Over 90 percent of  respondents said such practices are "necessary" or "inevitable,"  and 80 percent said they would "take" such job offers.    While vice ministers took prudent attitudes toward our  questions, division chiefs showed more straightforward responses.    In the questionnaire, we provided two questions about  "bureaucrat-led policymaking." In response to a true-or-false  question asking if public criticism of bureaucrats is true," 96  chiefs (36 percent) said "true," and 127 (48 percent) said  "false." The remaining 44 (16 percent) gave no answer. However,  when asked to freely describe opinions on the criticism of  "bureaucrat-led policymaking," 167 respondents, or 63 percent,  acknowledged such tendencies, or noted "social backgrounds  inevitably produces bureaucrat-led policymaking."    However, 66 respondents (25 percent) said they "do not think  bureaucrats have superior policymaking power."    As "background of bureaucrat-led policymaking," many  respondents indicated lack of politicians' leadership, political  parties' policy staff, and the Hosokawa administration's  managing ability. About two-thirds, or 109 out of 167 chiefs  who acknowledged "bureaucrat-led policymaking" noted that it is  caused by problems among politicians.    Some division chiefs showed bureaucrats' high self-esteem by  indicating "politicians cannot compete with bureaucrats who are  selected from very competitive universities and still face  severe competition everyday" (as noted by a Labor Ministry  division chief). On the other hand, they expressed complicated  feelings by indicating the limitations in bureaucrat-led  policymaking.    Regarding a public belief that "bureaucrats find  post-retirement jobs in the private sector making the most of  the government rules and authority," 147 respondents (44  percent) said "true," and 98 (37 percent) said "false."    In the "comments" column for the question, 179 out of 212  respondents (92 percent) who returned mailed questionnaires  showed positive attitudes toward such post-retirement jobs.  Some noted the practice is favorable from a viewpoint of  manpower utilization. A National Land Development Agency  division chief said: "(Bureaucrats) have experience, managing  ability, and wide-ranging relationships. Their abilities must  be utilized." Others noted most career bureaucrats are required  to retire in their 50's, and "a post-retirement career in the  private sector is needed make a living." A Management and  Coordination Agency respondent even said "the practice is the  only benefit for bureaucrats, and this must be left untouched."    Then we asked, "if you are offered a private-sector position  after your retirement, would you take it?" In reply, 86 out of  107 respondents (80 percent) "I would," "I would positively  think about it," or "I would have to take the job to make a  living."    The survey was intended for 1,028 division chiefs of all  ministries and agencies, including the National Police Agency  and the Imperial Household Agency. We conducted interviews for  65 chiefs working with ministerial secretariats, and obtained  other responses through the mail. Responses were obtained from  267 chiefs, including 55 from those who were interviewed.</p>

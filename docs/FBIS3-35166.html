			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Engineer Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for  the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has stated that he has  no information about the signing of an agreement between the  Fatah hawks and 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam battalions. He said,  however, that this does not rule out the existence of a field  agreement against the Zionist occupation.    Replying to a question by AL-DUSTUR, he said: We welcome  coordination with the struggling forces that are opposed to  capitulatory agreements. We also welcome joint action in major  jihad battles against the occupation troops and settlers.    In a statement following his return from Damascus the day  before yesterday, Ghawshah added: The central command of the  Alliance of Palestinian Forces held two five-hour sessions and  discussed the bylaws of the alliance and the organization  [tartib] of the effective arenas in the occupied homeland,  Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan. He said: A major part of the  meetings, held last Saturday and Sunday, was devoted to the  political activation of the alliance on the official and popular  levels as well as initial discussion of visits to some Arab  countries by delegations of the alliance forces to explain their  views toward the developments of the Palestine question. He  added: We discussed the possibility of forming delegations to  hold official meetings without specifying certain capitals or  dates.    Asked about the [PLO-Israeli] Cairo agreement, Ghawshah  said:  We have not discussed this issue seriously, but a joint  statement in the name of the alliance will shortly be issued in  this regard.    Four Palestinian factions included in the alliance issued a  statement a few days ago condemning the Cairo agreement,  considering it a step in a series of submissions to the Israeli  negotiating terms.    Ghawshah indicated that the alliance's central committee  members held a lengthy discussion on coordination and ways to  bolster it in the occupied territory elections in the wake of  the Gaza Doctors Union elections, in which the alliance was  defeated due to lack of coordination.    Answering a question on Yitzhaq Rabin's call on Hamas to  engage in dialogue, he said: The occupation forces continue to  seek dialogue with Hamas through some of its imprisoned leaders,  but our principled political stand rejects dialogue with the  occupation forces. The only dialogue lies in escalating the  jihad operations and intifadah activities until the liberation  of the Palestinian people, even if this takes scores of years.</p>

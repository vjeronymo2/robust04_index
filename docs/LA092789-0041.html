			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> "Roe vs. Wade," the TV movie about the events that culminated in the 1973  Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion in this country, will be  released on home video early next year. The NBC-produced movie, which won Emmys  for outstanding special and for Holly Hunter's lead performance just last week,  first aired on the network last May. Generally, television movies air twice on  the network before moving on to home video, but since NBC produced this project  in house, the network can earn extra revenue from home video sales while  retaining the rights to broadcast it again.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Reporter Li Anding (2621 1344 1353)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 21 Feb (XINHUA) -- As an important step to  deepen reform of the planning structure, the State Planning  Commission recently transmitted a production plan for industrial  and transport sectors for 1994, with projected targets as the  main body.    The projected targets are mainly aggregate targets whose  function is to provide information guidance; generally aggregate  targets will not be subdivided and transmitted to lower levels.  The scope and number of products under the mandatory plan are  further scaled down and reduced with the promotion of the  projected targets. In terms of gross industrial output value,  the ratio of the output plan for industrial products controlled  by the State Planning Commission plan in 1994 is down to 20  percent from 24 percent the previous year; the number of product  targets under the mandatory plan is down to 33 from 36, down 8.3  percent from the previous year; in terms of gross industrial  output value, the ratio of output value of the mandatory plan  (including state orders) was down to 4.6 percent from 6.8  percent the previous year.    There have also been great changes in the contents of the  mandatory plan. Price controls on most of the products under  the mandatory plan have been lifted, and the differences between  the prices of a small number of products that have not been  totally lifted and the market prices have gradually narrowed.  Generally, the state only does necessary balancing work on the  production conditions of certain products that fall under the  mandatory plan and ceases to provide blanket guarantees for  external production conditions of products that fall under the  mandatory plan.    The 1994 production plan for the industrial and transport  sectors provides strengthened planning management for key  enterprises' electricity consumption and for rail transport,  because they have the effect of imposing the constraint of a  "bottleneck" on the national economy. To optimize the  electricity supply and to ensure normal production by key  enterprises', the State Planning Commission, the State Economics  and Trade Commission, and the Ministry of Power Industry  transmitted the 1994 plan for electricity consumption by key  enterprises. As for a small number of enterprises which  undertake the heavy tasks of the state mandatory plan or  undertake the production of important products that affect the  national economy and the people's livelihood, the transport of  their products has been incoporated into the 1994 plan; railroad  departments will give priority to transporting their products.</p>

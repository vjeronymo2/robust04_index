Finance Minister Theo Waigel and Economics  Minister Guenter Rexrodt defended the government's action  program to increase growth and employment, but the SPD [Social  Democratic Party] accused the coalition of wanting to break the  social consensus within the country.    Waigel stressed that the policy of consolidation was to be  continued "without restrictions." The consolidation of public  budgets would promote economic growth and create new investment  opportunities for industry. The action program was a  "consistent" continuation of the privatization policy and the  instruments for controlling the labor market were being  extended. In order to encourage innovation, small- and  medium-size businesses would receive particular support.    Rexrodt stressed there were "clear indications" that the  economic downturn in Germany had been overcome. Export  prospects had improved. Optimism was justified, at least with  regard to the economy. However, this did not apply to the  development of the labor market. Therefore, the action program  focused on the creation of additional jobs.    Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier, the deputy chairperson of the SPD  parliamentary group, said the government was facing an economic  and financial "pile of rubble." For months, the government had  turned a blind eye to the rise in unemployment; now political  action was supposed to cover up the inability to act. [passage  omitted]</p>

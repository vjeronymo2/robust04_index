The so-called European Agreements give the two East European  countries greater access to the EC for their products, and  provide for an enhanced political dialogue.    The EC commissioners for foreign relations and foreign  trade,  Hans van den Broek and Leon Brittan, said the accords, signed in  December 1991 but not fully ratified until last December,  constituted "a landmark."    They said in a statement: "It enables the parties to fully  develop their political and economic cooperation in the context  of their future membership of the European Union (also known as  the EC)."    The agreements give no firm date for membership of the EC,  although they state this as an ultimate objective.    The trade terms of the accords have been in effect since  March 1, 1992. They commit the EC to a gradual lifting of  tariff barriers against industrial products to create a free  trade zone.    But some barriers against some products considered sensitive  in the EC will remain for several years to protect European  industries.    Thus tariffs on steel and coal will remain intact until  January 1996, and various textile tariffs for another one or two  years. Tariffs and quotas on agricultural goods will be  gradually lowered until July 1995.    Poland and Hungary will be given a little longer, until  end-1998 and end-2001 respectively, to open their markets to  products from the EC, and adopt the Community's competition laws.    The EC has also negotiated European agreements with the  Czech  and Slovak republics, Romania and Bulgaria. But these have not  yet been finalised.    In 1992 the EC chalked up a combined trade surplus of ECU2.5  billion ($2.8 billion) with the six countries.</p>

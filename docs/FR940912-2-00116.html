This notice also constitutes the scoping notice required by the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1501.7).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Description of proposed planning action: In accordance with Bureau of Land Management wilderness management policy guidance, Wilderness Management Plans will be developed for six wilderness areas. Because several of the areas share similar issues or are in close proximity with each other, the six areas will be covered by three wilderness management plans: one for the Tres Alamos Wilderness, one for the Signal Mountain and Woolsey Peak Wildernesses, and one for the Harquahala Mountains, Hummingbird Springs and Bighorn Mountains Wildernesses. An Environmental Assessment of the impacts of the proposed actions and alternatives will be prepared prior to approval of each plan. The plans will state policies, actions and monitoring standards to be used to maintain each area's wilderness resources and will consider issues and alternatives identified through a number of public forums including scoping meetings. The public is invited to participate in scoping meetings beginning in October 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Geographic areas involved: The six wilderness areas are in the Sonoran Desert of southwestern and south central Arizona, located in Maricopa, eastern La Paz, and southwestern Yavapai Counties. Towns in the vicinity are Bagdad, Wickenburg, Aquila, and Gila Bend. Distances from Phoenix range from 35 miles to the southwest, 55 miles to the west, and 80 miles to the northwest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Types of issues anticipated: Wilderness values such as naturalness, solitude and primitive recreational opportunities must be preserved. Use of these areas for developed public and commercial recreation, education, research, wildlife and wild burro management, livestock grazing, mining and existing private rights will be assessed. Acceptable levels of these uses as well as for primitive recreation will be identified. Appropriate levels of activity to administer the areas, e.g., assuring public access, providing recreational facilities, signing, law enforcement, search and rescue, wild burro removal, and fire suppression will be determined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Disciplines to be represented in the preparation of the management plans will include: Wilderness, Recreation, Cultural, Wildlife, Range, Livestock, Wild Burro and Fire Management.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The kind and extent of public involvement to be provided:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three public scoping meetings will be held to identify issues and opportunities for management of the six areas. These will be held in Gila Bend, Wickenburg and Phoenix, Arizona at the following times and locations:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> Tuesday, October 4, 1994, 6 p.m.&hyph;9 p.m., Gila Bend Community Center, 202 Euclid Ave., Gila Bend, Arizona.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wednesday, October 5, 1994, 6 p.m.&hyph;9 p.m., Wickenburg Community Center, 160 North Valentine Street, Wickenburg, Arizona.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thursday, October 6, 1994, 6 p.m.&hyph;9 p.m., Phoenix District Office Conference Room, Bureau of Land Management, 2015 West Deer Valley Road, Phoenix, Arizona.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments regarding issues and opportunities for management will also be accepted until October 15, 1994.

Management and use of these areas is directed by this law as well as the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 and the Wilderness Act of 1964. The area involved in this planning effort include 8,300 acres in the Tres Alamos Wilderness, 22,880 acres in the Harquahala Mountains Wilderness, 31,200 acres in the Hummingbird Springs Wilderness, 21,000 acres in the Bighorn Mountains Wilderness, 15,250 acres in the Signal Mountain Wilderness, and 64,000 acres in the Woolsey Peak Wilderness. Areas and activities on non-wilderness land adjacent to the wilderness boundaries may also be addressed in these plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These areas are also described in the Lower Gila South and Upper Sonoran Final Wilderness Environmental Impact Statements of 1987 available at the above address.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: September 2, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Gordon L.

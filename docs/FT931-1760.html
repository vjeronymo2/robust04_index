			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Business and the Environment: Poisoned chalice - A Japanese gift of 35,000 litres of pesticide to Cambodia has caused uproar The brown plant-hopper, an insect pest which eats Asia's staple rice crops, is playing a leading role in a drama about the future of Cambodian agriculture, but it is not the true villain of the piece. If environmentalists and scientists are to be believed, the villain is the Japanese government. Japan's decision to supply Cambodia with free pesticides has provoked sharp criticism from environmental pressure groups and from officials of respected bodies such as the International Rice Research Institute and the Food and Agriculture Organisation. Cambodia, after more than two decades of war, has no legislation or controls on the use of pesticides. Nor do farmers or agriculture ministry officials have much experience in handling chemicals. The Japanese government is therefore suspected of donating the pesticides not to help Cambodian farmers but to help the Japanese chemical industry secure a new market for its products. These suspicions are fuelled by the knowledge that Japan may eventually be forced by world trade negotiations to open its rice market to foreign suppliers. Japanese farmers account for only 2.5 per cent of world rice production, but they are heavy buyers of pesticides. Although the amounts are small - Japan has shipped 35,000 litres of diazinon, fenitrothion and fenvalerate worth Y100m (Pounds 592,000) to Cambodia as part of a Y500m 'food production increase grant' - many aid workers believe the gift sets a poor precedent for a country struggling to develop its agriculture. The objections arise because evidence from Indonesia, Thailand (see graph) and elsewhere shows that broad spectrum insecticides such as the three donated by Japan, far from reducing the number of pests, actually worsen pest infestation in tropical rice. That is because the insecticides kill not only the insect pests but also predators, such as spiders, which normally eat the pests. Pest populations often recover more quickly than the predators. Adult brown plant-hoppers, for example, may be exterminated in a field by chemical spray, but only after laying their eggs safely inside the rice plants. When they hatch, the young pests breed rapidly and their population explodes in the absence of predators. All three insecticides donated by Japan are now banned for use on rice in Indonesia. 'Every other country that has had massive use of pesticides has created their own problems,' says Gregory Woodsworth, a Canadian environmental planner based in Phnom Penh. 'To date Cambodia has not had any severe pest attacks. If they start using these pesticides they sure as hell will.' Critics of the Japanese aid are concerned not only about the agricultural implications but also the effects of the pesticides on humans and fish. Diazinon and fenitrothion are organophosphates which disrupt the nervous system and are dangerous to humans. Protective clothing should be worn by anyone applying such pesticides, but even if they were available, they would be impractical in Cambodia's stiflingly hot climate. 'A human being can't apply it in any way that's practical in the tropics,' says Peter Kenmore, an expert on the control of pests in Asian rice at the FAO in Manila. 'Organophosphates cannot be applied safely by small farmers in tropical conditions.' All three chemicals donated by Japan are in some measure toxic to fish and crabs, which live in rice fields and nearby ponds in Cambodia and account for much of the protein consumed by villagers. Japan's response to the uproar over its gift has done little to allay the fears or suspicions about the pesticides. Japanese diplomats say seminars have been arranged to teach Cambodians how to use the chemicals, which will, in any case, only be sufficient to treat some 40,000 hectares of the country's 2m ha of farmland. Toru Imamura, the first secretary responsible for aid at the Japanese mission in Phnom Penh, described the protest campaign as 'very politically oriented' and said that he thought the protestors were 'over-reacting'. He acknowledged, however, that Japan was not providing any protective clothing, although it was donating the machines to spray the insecticides. Japan insists the distribution and safe handling of the pesticides is the responsibility of the Cambodian agriculture ministry, a stand which appears to take no account of the fact that the ministry's headquarters are barely functioning; the ministry is part of a corrupt, financially crippled and moribund government that is likely to lose some or all of its power in the UN-sponsored elections in May. The Japanese diplomatic mission also points out that the former Soviet Union and its allies sent pesticides to Cambodia in the past, and the mission can produce a list of 56 pesticides available in the country in 1989 to prove it. Japan - by no means the first aid donor to have given something apparently unnecessary or harmful to a recipient country - says it is fully aware of environmental concerns and has reduced both the quantity and the range of pesticides originally earmarked for Cambodia. But neither the decision to reduce the amount nor the justification that the Russians sent pesticides in the past adequately explain why the Japanese pesticides are being sent, when there is so much evidence against them, particularly in the absence of any detailed research into their probable impact on Cambodia.</p>

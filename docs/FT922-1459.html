			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (24): Distinctions are starting to blur - Workstations UNTIL RECENTLY, workstations were easy to define. They were technical computers aimed at high resolution graphical or computationally intensive work. But workstation makers began to see new opportunities in the general business market. As they began to push downmarket towards the high end of the personal computer business, PC hardware and software companies pushed upwards, blurring the boundaries between the two. While all workstations are characterised by high performance graphics screens, connection to a network and the ability to execute several tasks at the same time, they can be put into three distinct groups - entry level, technical and super workstation - differentiated by power, price and expandability: Power. The power of these machines is usually measured in SPECmarks. According to Dataquest, the entry level machine in 1991 scored between 11 and 26 SPECmarks, the technical machine scored 24 to 72 SPECmarks and the super workstation rated 50 to 159. Such is the pace of change in the workstation market that the entry level machine is expected to reach 50 SPECmarks in 1992. No doubt those further up the scale will also increase in power. Price: Dataquest gives price brackets for the three groups as follows: entry level - up to Dollars 15,000; technical - between Dollars 15,000 and Dollars 60,000; super workstation - from Dollars 60,000 to over Dollars 200,000. These are based on 1991 figures and, as with all developments in the computer industry, these may be expected to drop. Expandability: Most workstations use a reduced instruction set computer (Risc) processor. Risc processors deliver about twice the power of the older complex instruction set computers (CISC) for the same price. This is done by removing the 80 per cent of the little used instructions from the silicon. The removed instructions can still be carried out by executing those remaining in various combinations. In terms of revenues and volume shipped, Sun has been the most successful workstation maker. Its machines are based on its own SPARC chip which it has licenced to other manufacturers in a bid to set a standard. Hewlett-Packard presently has the most powerful processor in its Precision Architecture (PA) chip, although Digital Equipment Corporation has announced its intention to create an Alpha Risc chip with astonishing capabilities. IBM has its RS/6000 series of workstations and has teamed up with Apple and Motorola to create single-chip implementations of the RS/6000 processing unit, to be called PowerPC. Like Digital's Alpha chip, this has yet to make a public appearance. One workstation manufacturer which has not yet announced a Risc-based machine is NeXT, the company created by Apple founder Steve Jobs. Within the company, there seems to have been some confusion about whether the machine was to be sold as a high end Macintosh, as a developer's machine or as a business workstation. In the US, the present machine did well in the educational market. In Germany it notched up considerable success as a UNIX-based business workstation. NeXT computers UK, learning from the German experience, is repositioning itself as a supplier of business machines. Although the NeXT computer is powered by Motorola 680X0 CISC processors and appears to be trailing in hardware technology, it is probably well ahead of the game in software development tools. One of the nightmares for any company using computers is the huge cost of application development. One way to reduce this problem is to employ re-usable code. This approach - Object Oriented Programming (OOP) - enables new application developments to be bolted together from pieces of code already written for earlier applications. Research suggests that this can speed application development up to ten times. NeXT already has an object-oriented developers environment - a collection of programming and development tools - called NeXTstep. Apple and IBM recently joined forces to form Taligent, a company whose first product will be an object-oriented operating system. At a stroke, these companies have legitimised the approach that NeXT committed itself to five years ago. Sun intends to establish its Solaris application development environment on both SPARC and Intel processors. Windows NT is expected to appear on multiple platforms. And NeXTstep has been ported to, that is made to work on, the Intel 80486 platform. Microsoft has the advantage of an large existing user base which may want to stay with a Windows-type system, rather than having to learn something new. Like Microsoft, IBM/Apple intends to make the fruits of its labours available on multiple platforms. Within three years, the distinction between low end workstations and high end PCs will disappear.</p>

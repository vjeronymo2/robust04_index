			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Open letter to Leonid Kravchuk, president of Ukraine, from </F> H. Hotovchyts and other officials: "Mr. President! Put a Stop to  a New Chernobyl!"]    [Text] Dear Leonid Makarovych!    We feel compelled to write to you concerning Edict N0. 64/94  "On Urgent Measures Regarding the Development of Nuclear Power  Engineering and the Formation of the Nuclear Power Cycle in  Ukraine"--an Edict signed by you and dated 23 February 1994. It  must be acknowleged that this Edict was not coordinated or  reconciled with the departments concerned, and this has led to  several contradictions between its provisions and the  legislation now in effect. This fact has also  led--correspondingly--to the impossibility of carrying out  certain decisions.    First of all, that part of the Edict which pertains to the  burial of radioactive wastes contradicts the "Concepts of the  State Regulation of the Safety and Administration of the Nuclear  Industrial Sector in Ukraine," as adopted by the Ukrainian  Supreme Council on 25 January 1994.    The principal questions in this problem concern the burial  of  radioactive wastes. In the "Concepts..." adopted by the Supreme  Council, as well as in the draft laws "On the Utilization of  Nuclear Power and Radiation Protection" and "On Safety  Procedures With Radioactive Wastes," which were officially  submitted by the Cabinet of Ministers to the Supreme Council for  examination and consideration, it is specified that the  utilization of nuclear power and the burial of wastes are to be  carried out based on the principle of delimitation between these  sectors of activity.    Nor can we deem feasible the instructions with regard to the  tasks of creating a medical-santitation administration within  the Derzhkomatom [State Committee on Nuclear Power] and  subordinating the medical-sanitation sections of the AES's  [nuclear power stations] to it, for this would violate the  existing system of health care in Ukraine and would inflict  substantial damage to those measures which are carried out in  direct subordination to the Ukrainian Ministry of Health, taking  into account the existing shortcomings, as well as the practical  experience gained in eliminating the consequences of the  accident at the Chernobyl AES.    The Derzhatomnahlyad [State Committee on Nuclear Power  Oversight] cannot provide for or ensure the execution of  measures regarding the modernization of existing AES units or  put new power units into operation because--in accordance with  the Government's decrees--it is a regulatory and oversight organ  in the sphere of utilizing nuclear power. What we need is more  detailed study and grounds for justifying the possibility of  putting another power unit of the Chernobyl AES into operation  in 1995.    We must likewise take into account the fact that any  decisions regarding the introduction of new power units at  existing AES's and the organization of new enterprises for  processing uranium can be adopted only after appropriate expert  opinions have been rendered and reconciled with the regulatory  and monitoring organs.    There are several other observations to be made with regard  to the above-mentioned Edict. Therefore, taking into  consideration the factors cited by us here, we request that you  rescind this Edict and send it back for further work and  reconciliation by the departments concerned.    [Signed] H. Hotovchyts, Ukrainian Ministry for Protection of  the Population from the Aftermath of Chernobyl    [Signed] Yu. Spizhenko, Ukrainian Ministry of Health    M. Shteynberg, Derzhatomnahlyad    Yu. Kostenko, Ministry of Environmental Protection</p>

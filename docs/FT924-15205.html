			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Down and down again BRITAIN'S economic policy establishment, like its economy, is paralysed. But the longer the paralysis continues, the deeper will be the damage from the debacle of recent weeks. The government needs a new medium-term framework for policy and an institutional structure to implement it. Only then can it hope to bring real order into sterling's position in the foreign exchanges. It was always inevitable that sterling would fall further against its European partner currencies than justified by economic fundamentals. Sterling's fall since the UK left the ERM has, in fact, so far been well short of a disaster: 14 per cent against the D-Mark but only 11 per cent using a trade-weighted basket of currencies including the yen and the dollar. Against the dollar, this represents a return to normality after the heady heights to which sterling was previously dragged by the D-Mark's appreciation. The inflation risk from such a devaluation is contained by the economy's deeply depressed state. Yet the government cannot afford to allow sterling to go on falling if it wishes to avoid stoking up serious inflationary problems. The most obvious course of action in these circumstances - to raise interest rates - would almost certainly be counter-productive. Given the depth of the recession, double-digit UK interest rates are not credible because the markets know that the government cannot sustain them. Siren voices What the markets need is reassurance that Mr Major is not going to bow to the siren voices, both within and outside his party, and cut interest rates too hard too fast. Large cuts in UK interest rates now are the best way to ensure that this latest devaluation, like all the others of recent decades, leads to consumption and inflation rather than investment and growth. A prudent short-term monetary policy would imply falls in interest rates over the next year, but only once the markets are calmer. The experience of the US, Australia and other debt-burdened economies is that cuts in short-term interest rates combined with substantial currency depreciations can be accommodated without generating inflation. But no one knows how much UK policy has been eased by the fall in sterling of the past few weeks. And the UK's inflationary psychology means that a softly softly approach on interest rates is all the government can afford to pursue if the gains to competitiveness of the past weeks are to be retained. Policy gap While the government remains silent, and the markets nervous and jumpy, the risk of a further collapse will remain. The task facing the government is to calm the situation. This cannot be achieved by party conference speeches; it requires the policy gap to be filled. It is very difficult to see how Mr Norman Lamont can assist his prime minister in addressing this enormous credibility problem. Mr Lamont's difficulty is not that anything he says is by definition incredible. In fact, the opposite is true. The longer he stays in office and is seen by some to be dangling the prospect of rapid interest rate cuts to Euro-sceptical Tories, the more the markets will lean on the pound. The words Mr Lamont needs to use to bolster his political position in Brighton this week are precisely those which will do most damage in the markets. Much more important than any changes in Treasury personnel, however, is the removal of the power to make monetary policy from Treasury hands. Promises to fight inflation or to monitor an unspecified range of economic indicators, whatever they may be, will continue to ring hollow when uttered by British politicians of any party, whether counselled by the current or any other cohort of Treasury advisers. The government needs a new division of economic labour. An independent Bank of England is no panacea. But it would be a step towards monetary policy credibility, if suitably constituted. Taking the power to set interest rates out of political hands is also a precondition of a successful re-entry of sterling into the ERM. Only then would the Treasury be free to cut public spending and/or raise taxes and so maximise the chances of an investment-led recovery.</p>

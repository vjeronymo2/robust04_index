			<p>BFN     [Text] This year, the province has been hit by a severe  drought unknown over the past 10 years, which has devastated  summer grain crops to a serious extent and threatened autumn  grain crops as well. As a result, drought resistance and  disaster relief are now an overriding task for the province's  rural work. Given the rigorous drought situation at the moment,  the province held a drought resistance and disaster relief  teleconference yesterday afternoon.    The teleconference disclosed that since last September, the  province has received less than 50 percent of its usual rainfall  and got only meager rainfall last May when wheat was sprouting  and in the flowering and autumn sowing period. The province's  total reservoir water storage capacity has also dropped by 100  million cubic meters compared with the same period of last year.  As a result, some 970,000 people and more than 730,000 head of  livestock will be affected by a short supply of drinking water.    Provincial party committee Secretary Yan Haiwang spoke at  yesterday's teleconference calling on all areas and departments  concerned in the province to take drought resistance and  disaster relief as an overriding task for the province's rural  work at the moment, make sufficient ideological preparations for  waging a whole-scale drought resistance struggle across the  province, fully mobilize and rely on enthusiasm of the broad  masses of cadres and people, adopt comprehensive  drought-resistance measures, assemble all available human,  material, and financial resources for drought resistance and  disaster relief work, strive to protect the province's grain  crops by all means, and make every possible endeavor to reduce  the province's drought-related losses to a minimum.    Secretary Yan Haiwang noted: While implementing the relevant  drought resistance measures in a timely fashion, we should also  show great concern and make flawless arrangements for people's  livelihood, carry out in-depth and meticulous work in disaster  areas, and make effective use of disaster relief funds.    Provincial Vice Governor Cai Xiaosu also spoke at the  teleconference spelling out comprehensive arrangements for the  province's drought resistance and disaster relief work.</p>

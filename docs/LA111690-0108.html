"It's in my best interest. I need to get on with my  life. They need to get on with theirs."  </P> <P> The youngest Division I-A football coach when he was hired four years ago,  Archer has a 26-17-1 record in his first head coaching job.  </P> <P> Fired football coach Dick Crum will be on the sidelines Saturday for Kent's  final game of the season against Eastern Michigan, but the university hopes to  name a replacement soon after, a school spokesperson said Thursday.  </P> <P> Crum has a 6-26 record in three seasons at Kent. The Golden Flashes are 1-9  this season.  </P> <P> Crum began his head coaching career at Miami of Ohio, where he compiled a  34-10-1 record from 1974-77. He was the winningest football coach in North  Carolina history, compiling a 72-41 record from 1978-87.  </P> <P> Six Texas A&amp;M football players and a former player have been charged with  illegally using telephone charge cards. But Coach R.C. Slocum said the  allegations won't keep the players out of Saturday's game against Arkansas.  </P> <P> Slocum told the Bryan-College Station Eagle and the Texas A&amp;M student  newspaper, the Battalion, that he will not take any disciplinary action against  the athletes unless they are found guilty. Those charged are Derek Ware, 23;  Jason Medlock, 19; Felton Ransby, 22; Derrick Frazier, 20; Marlin Haynes, 20;  Kary Vincent, 20; and Derick Richey, 22, who played last year.  </P></p>

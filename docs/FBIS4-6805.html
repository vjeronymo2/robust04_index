			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Three dailies carry editorials on the recent Medan  protests.    Bandung PIKIRAN RAKYAT regrets that the protests demanding  greater welfare lost their direction and that conscience was  replaced by emotions. The Medan incident, which cost lives and  property, has obviously marred the sacred struggle of the  Indonesian workers. PIKIRAN RAKYAT hopes that officials in  charge of manpower more actively monitor the condition of  workers in their respective areas in the wake of the Medan  incident.    ANGKATAN BERSENJATA focuses on who is behind the protests.  It says the culprit is none other than the so-called Indonesian  Prosperous Trade Union or SBSI. The minister of manpower does  not recognize SBSI as an organization representing workers.  Moreover, the organization has not been registered, and its  existence has not been endorsed by the minister of home affairs.  However, SBSI continues to conduct its activities, while the  press consciously or unconsciously helps promote the  organization by giving wide converage to its statements and  activities. SBSI does not stop its activities, although workers  are indifferent to some of its activities. Its methods --  agitation, dissemination of rumors, and mass action -- led to  violence. In the wake of the incident, ANGKATAN BERSENJATA  calls for a comprehensive investigation of SBSI's involvement in  the Medan protests, including subsequent action against its  leaders. Meanwhile, the daily urges the All Indonesian Trade  Union [SPSI] as an organization representing workers to be more  sensitive to the aspirations of its members.    Focusing on the incident, POS KOTA says the Medan protests  showed that the Pancasila industrial relations system is not  working as it should. According to POS KOTA, it is very  important to implement the Pancasila industrial relations system  in local private companies, let alone in foreign private  companies. It has often been questioned as to why most  businessmen refuse to sign employment agreements and allow SPSI  to set up units in working places and why the government has no  power to require or force them to do so. The question has yet to  be fully answered, POS KOTA concludes.</p>

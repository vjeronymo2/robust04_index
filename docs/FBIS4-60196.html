			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, Yemen, May 22 (AFP) -- A missile believed to  have been fired by north Yemen forces slammed into an eastern  district of Aden early Sunday killing two people and wounding  three others, rescue workers said.    The missile fell on a house in the Khormaksar district  causing widespread damage and cutting electricity supplies to  the area.    All the casualties were from the same family, ambulance  crews  said.    The attack was the first missile strike on Aden since the  proclamation 24 hours ago of an independent state in the south  in what used to be the Marxist republic of South Yemen.    Two Scud missiles fell on the port city overnight Thursday  as  fighting raged between the northern troops of President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih and southern troops backing former  vice-president 'Ali Salim al-Bid.    The attack came two hours after a five-man presidential  council was officially named to head the southern independent  state proclaimed overnight Friday by al-Bid, the leader of the  Yemeni Socialist Party, the reformed ex-ruling party in South  Yemen.    The north and south, which united four years ago Sunday,  have  been embroiled in a civil war since May 4.</p>

			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MILLIONS IN U.S. DOLLARS STOLEN IN EXCHANGE FRAUD, BRAZIL SAYS  </P> <P> A criminal gang siphoned hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars from Brazil's  foreign exchange reserves in fraudulent financial operations that used 20  commercial banks, including five in New York, to falsify documents for  fictitious imports, Brazilian authorities say.  </P> <P> Federal police investigating the case have officially opened dozens of  inquiries, including several Friday in Rio. Federal Police Chief Romeu Tuma  said he will send a team of federal police officers to the United States next  week for further investigations there.  </P> <P> Justice Minister Saulo Ramos said in a Thursday news conference that the scam  was "the biggest exchange fraud in the history of Brazil" and served as a way  to launder money from drug trafficking. Ramos told reporters that the gang also  may have helped companies in Brazil illegally remit profits from the country.  </P> <P> He admitted a possibility of "involvement by high public officials in the  operation." No government officials have been charged in the case, but Tuma  said seven people indicted so far include an employee of the Banco do Estado de  Paraiba, a commercial bank owned by a northeastern Brazilian state.  </P> <P> Tupy Caldas de Moura, a Central Bank official, said the fictitious imports were  documented under the names of corporations that existed only on paper.  Investigators have found nearly 600 fraudulent import contracts, dating from  1987, that drew an estimated $360 million from Brazilian dollar reserves.  </P> <P> Investigators believe that all of the frauds were committed by the same gang,  Moura said. "The irregularities found in the various operations are very  similar," he said.  </P> <P> New York banks named by Justice Minister Ramos were Manufacturers Hanover, Bank  of New England, First New York Bank for Business, First Woman's Bank and a U.S.  office of the Brazilian bank Bamerindus. Ramos also named 15 banks in Brazil  and six brokerages.  </P> <P> "The bankers will have to help in the investigations since they all have  responsibility, at least for lack of vigilance," Ramos said.  </P> <P> Leo Wallace Cochrane Jr., president of the Federation of Bank Assns. of Brazil,  said the fraudulent operations began with falsified government documents that  cannot be blamed on banks.  </P> <P> "The involvement of the banks is zero," he said.  </P> <P> Here is how officials say the scheme worked:  </P> <P> A "drone" working for the gang filled out a form requesting an import permit  from the government bureau of foreign trade, known as Cacex. Once the permit  was approved, the gang altered figures on it to increase the value of the  import.  </P> <P> With the permit, the gang obtained a document called a "declaration of  importation" from another government office. A financial broker delivered the  permit and the declaration to the exchange department of a commercial bank.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, someone claiming to represent a fictitious exporting company in the  United States had a bank in New York send a false invoice and bill of lading to  the bank in Brazil. With the documents from both ends of the false transaction,  the bank in Brazil accepted a check in Brazilian cruzados from the "importer"  and completed an exchange contract, telexing an order of payment in dollars to  the U.S. "exporter."  </P> <P> Officials say the payment in cruzados by the gang violated Central Bank  regulations requiring such payments to be made from an account in the importing  company's name. Instead, the gang used cashiers checks, checks payable to the  bearer and even cash.  </P> <P> Because the dollars were purportedly for authorized imports, they were drawn at  the official exchange rate from the Central Bank, as required for all  international transactions. Later, the gang brought some of the same dollar  funds back to Brazil and traded them on the black market at a premium rate that  sometimes is more than double the official rate.  </P></p>

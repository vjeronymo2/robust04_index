			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russians more active at tea auction centres ANTICIPATING that the Indian federal government will soon be announcing a fresh credit line of Dollars 75m to Russia, including Dollars 30m for tea, Russian buying agents for have become active at the Calcutta and other tea auction centres. Confirming the fairly strong buying for Russia, Mr Vijay Dudeja, spokesman for the brokers, said the auction prices for teas had started improving, though they were still lower than last year. The expected new credit line would enable Russia to procure at least 16m kg of tea. According to Mr Dudeja, the recent purchases for Russia include CTC (cut, tear and curl), orthodox and Darjeeling teas. Russia had earlier in the season imported 15m kg of tea by utilising the first tranche of technical credit of Dollars 32m. According to industry officials, a substantial portion of Indian tea being exported to Poland is destined eventually for Russia. Up to August, India's total tea exports amounted to 102m kg, compared with 114m kg in the first eight months of last year. Considering that Russian buying has slowed down considerably, India has not done badly. Mr HP Barooah, chairman of the Indian Tea Association, said that following the rupee devaluation, Indian tea had become competitive with Sri Lankan and Kenyan varieties. Because of this, India was able to export more tea to the UK, Iran, Egypt and Jordan. Pakistan, which usually imports about 150m kg of tea a year, mostly from Sri Lanka, Kenya and Indonesia, held great promise for Indian exporters. Mr Barooah said. In spite of the export setback there has not been a precipitious fall in the auction prices. That was because the country's tea output up to August fell by 31.8m kg to 420.4m kg, the ITA chairman said.</p>

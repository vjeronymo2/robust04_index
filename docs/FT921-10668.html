			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Company News: GTE reports 10% earnings rise in fourth quarter GTE, the largest local telephone company in the US, yesterday reported a 10 per cent increase in fourth-quarter net income, in spite of the slowdown in the US economy. Net income totalled Dollars 515m, or 57 cents a share, compared with Dollars 467m, or 52 cents, in the same period of 1990. Revenues and sales rose 7 per cent to Dollars 5.2bn. Income from continuing operations, excluding GTE's electrical products business, which is being divested, totalled Dollars 481m, or 53 cents, up from Dollars 435m, or 48 cents. The company said the results reflected the continuing weakness of the economy, offset partly by lower interest rates. Excluding an accounting change, earnings per share from continuing operations rose 6 per cent. GTE's telephone operations produced a 3 per cent rise in fourth-quarter operating income to Dollars 1bn, against 5 per cent for the year; the company blamed the slowdown of the economy. Telecommunications products and services produced income of Dollars 35m, compared with a loss of Dollars 18m in 1990. GTE, which acquired Contel, a large local and cellular telephone company last year, said customer growth in the cellular area had continued at a high level in 1991. Some 84,000 customers had been added during the fourth quarter, bringing the total served to 811,000, compared with 594,000 at the end of 1990. For the full year, consolidated net income totalled Dollars 1.8bn, or Dollars 1.98 a share, compared with Dollars 1.85 earned on a pro forma basis in 1990, including Contel's results for the full year. The 1991 figures excludes a Dollars 204m one-time special charge.

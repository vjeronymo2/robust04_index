			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Berkertex businesses sold to Wm Baird WILLIAM BAIRD, the textiles and engineering company, has acquired most of the rest of Berkertex Holdings that the receiver had not previously sold. The combined turnover of the acquired businesses was Pounds 29.1m in the year to January 1992. The price was not revealed, but Baird said that it 'reflected the forced nature of the sale'. Conversely, Touche Ross, the receiver, said that the amount reflected 'the attractiveness of the businesses'. Last week, the receivers at the last minute and in a fairy godmotherly way, agreed to supply dresses ordered from the collapsed company for the Queen Charlotte's Ball in London. Mr Andrew Mills-Baker, Baird's finance director, said that the acquisition was a good fit with his company's current operations and filled gaps in the women's wear market that it did not already cover. The same also applied to the bridal wear segment - Berkertex Bridal, which operates at the upper end, will be run by Baird's Bridal Fashions, which leans towards the lower. Baird's Windsmoor Group, which makes smart everyday women's wear, will operate Berkertex Dress, which makes formal women's wear, and Genesis, which makes smart casual wear. Mr Mills-Baker said that the acquisition was a good opportunity for his group. Baird had been able to pick and choose what it wanted - it only bought two of the Berkertex shops (Bond Street, London and Nottingham), leaving the remaining 14 with the receiver. It had picked up most of the shops-within-shops in the UK and 26 in Spain, where Windsmoor also has concessions. Furthermore, Baird had bought the goodwill and the trademarks of famous brand names, as well as the stock at a discount. With those advantages and the opportunities for running the acquired businesses without overheads rising proportionally, Mr Mills-Baker said he was pleased to have outbid the other interested companies, both UK and non-UK.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The United States Now in High Spirits for </F> Economic Revival"; from Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 27 January  Morning Edition]    [Text] The annual policy speech the U.S. President makes  to Congress at the beginning of the year is called "state of the  union address" in English. Most of the one hour-odd speech  given by President Bill Clinton on the evening of 25 January  (morning of 26 January Japan time) was devoted to the economy,  health care reform, education, welfare, and other domestic  issues. It was literally a speech worthy of the term "state of  the union address."    It was a speech devoid of the pretentious rhetoric  characteristic of most presidential addresses, and was a piece  of pragmatic discourse focusing on policy. While some say it  was not a speech becoming the president of a major power,  considering Clinton's position as the President of a United  States with declining power in the post-Cold War world, which is  exerting desperate efforts toward economic revival, his speech  was straightforward and made a favorable impression.    One year ago, when the first baby boomer president took  office, few, even inside the Democratic Party, believed that  Clinton's economic policies would be successful. However, as  Japan and the nations on the European continent moan under an  economic recession, the U.S. economy is now definitely on its  way to recovery.    One can sense confidence in his policy direction and his own  leadership from the President's speech, which puts across the  optimistic atmosphere that has come back to U.S. society after a  long time.    The president used the word "renewal" many times. Although  proud of the achievements in the past year, he said: "We know  and acknowledge that our work has just begun. There is more to  be done."    Although Clinton is in a tight spot over the appointment of  a  defense secretary, and scandals have created controversies in  the mass media, his popularity rating has recovered, and his  administration is basically stable.    Clinton plans to carry on with administrative and fiscal  reforms, and reduce federal government personnel by 252,200 in  five years. He stressed that "we will work hard for the American  people, who pay our salaries."    The President strongly advocated the reform of the health  care system, where "58 million Americans have no coverage at  all." In this health care reform, of which Mrs. Hillary Clinton  is in charge, the president spoke of "the courage to face up to  the special interests obstructing the reform."    Lights did not go off in the White House until the late  hours  for days on end. Meetings were held with the President even  late at night or early in the morning. Expensive restaurants in  the neighborhood complained that they were out of business  because the White House staff never came out to eat.    Foreign affairs will be the task for the hardworking  President from now on. "There are some who argue that with the  end of the Cold War, the United States should turn its back on  the rest of the world," but the President asserted that "we will  not stop our contributions to the world." He expressed the  intention to continue to exercise leadership in building a new  world order.    The word "Japan" did not appear at all in the speech.  However, President Clinton has to take Japan into  consideration, whether as a partner or as a competitor, in many  of the things he wants to do from now on.    In that sense, one cannot help being apprehensive about how  the United States will behave at the Japan-U.S. summit in  February, which will discuss the economic framework talks.</p>

			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Major reopens talks on Ulster MR JOHN MAJOR succeeded last night in using a meeting he had called on Northern Ireland security to resuscitate his government's efforts to open round-table talks on the province's political future. Unionist and nationalist leaders agreed to discuss how obstacles to formal talks - which had been postponed until after the general election - could be overcome. The outcome of nearly two hours of talks was described by Downing Street as a 'modest but significant breakthrough'. However, the agreement was in effect no more than a promise to 'talk about talks', with little to suggest they would be more successful than past efforts to start formal negotiations by Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary. Mr Major called the meeting - the first for sixteen years between a prime minister and all Northern Ireland's political parties - because of the escalation in terrorist violence in the province. He also appeared swayed by claims that by putting political talks into abeyance, the government was creating a political vacuum which could be exploited by terrorists. The Downing Street meeting came only hours after police found a terrorist device in a telephone box in nearby Parliament Street. Police sealed off Whitehall after a telephone warning. A senior official said the meeting 'needed to make progress to show that politics can work'. The prime minister has also agreed to meet soon with Mr Albert Reynolds, the new Irish prime minister. Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, the two Unionist leaders, appeared impressed at Mr Major's personal intervention, even though only a part of the meeting was devoted to their concerns on security. Downing Street said internment - one of the Ulster Unionists' main demands - was not discussed. Mr Molyneaux described Mr Major's role as an 'enormous help'. Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party, said the talks were 'positive'. The leaders were also unanimous in deploring both loyalist and republican terrorism.

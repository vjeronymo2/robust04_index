			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Marina Lebedeva report: "Human Rights Campaigners </F> Concerned at Violations in Russia and Intend To Speak to Clinton  About It"]    [Text] A news conference has been held at the "Memorial"  human rights society.    In the opinion of the conference's organizers -- the  Russian-U.S. Human Rights Bureau, the "Memorial" human rights  center, "Helsinki Watch," the "Civil Aid" committee, and other  organizations -- over the past six months and particularly in  connection with the October events the situation with regard to  human rights compliance in Russia has deteriorated sharply.    "We intend to express our concern at the present situation,"  the director of the Moscow branch of the Russian-U.S. Human  Rights Bureau said, "and to bring to B. Clinton's notice  specific instances of human rights violations."    S. Ganushkina, cochairman of the "Civil Aid" committee,  pointed out that, although Russia subscribed to the Geneva  Convention on Refugees and adopted the Russian law on refugees  in its spirit, it is fulfilling neither document. Refugees are  virtually denied this status. In particular, refugees from the  Caucasus and Central Asia end up in a grave situation.  Ganushkina pointed out that they are being combated with all  kinds of decrees, both covert and overt. The latest decision is  to expel from hotels and hostels refugees who have already lived  in Moscow for four years. As of 1 January this year they are  obliged to pay the full cost of the room, which is totally  impossible for the absolute majority -- sick people and  pensioners.    V. Abramkin, director of the Center To Promote Prison Reform  in Russia, said:    "There are now approximately 1 million prisoners in Russia.  According to physicians' estimates, 100,000 prisoners are ill  with tuberculosis, 20,000 of them in an acute form. There is  insufficient meat, bread, and milk in the prisons and detention  centers where they are held. There are many complaints about  prisoners being beaten up and tortured. Prisons and detention  centers in large cities are overflowing."</p>

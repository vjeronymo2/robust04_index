			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOCIALISTS END FEUD OVER 1995 CANDIDATE;  </P> <P> FRANCE: PARTY LEADERS AGREE TO A TRUCE AFTER A SCOLDING FROM PRESIDENT  MITTERRAND.  </P> <P> After a scolding from French President Francois Mitterrand, feuding Socialist  Party leaders called a truce Wednesday in a bitter, oddly premature power  struggle to see who will succeed him as the party's next presidential  candidate.  </P> <P> Said by aides to be "embarrassed and furious" over the public squabbling among  his would-be political successors -- they are the prime minister, two  government ministers, the Speaker of the National Assembly and the president of  the European Commission -- Mitterrand summoned party first secretary Pierre  Mauroy to the Elysee Palace late Tuesday. He called for a cease-fire in the  succession battle, which comes a full five years before his term as president  expires in 1995.  </P> <P> After meeting all night, the party leaders emerged at 5 a.m. Wednesday with a  compromise plan that will keep Mauroy, a former prime minister, as party first  secretary and portion out other key party posts to supporters of the five  rivals for Mitterrand's job.  </P> <P> According to political analysts here, the fight inside the Socialist Party was  the worst in the 20 years since Mitterrand, 73, built it into an important  national political organization.  </P> <P> "The Socialist Party will likely pay dearly for the disastrous effects produced  by the quarrels between these pretenders who are only thinking about the  succession of Francois Mitterrand," wrote editor Andre Fontaine in an editorial  on the front page of the influential Paris daily Le Monde.  </P> <P> Signs of the cracks in the ruling party were obvious over the weekend at its  biennial convention in the Brittany capital of Rennes. The four-day meeting  ended in disarray after delegates, hooting and whistling at rivals of those  they supported, failed to agree on a party platform or name someone to the  important post of first party secretary.  </P> <P> In an attempt to break the convention deadlock, centered mainly on a feud  between National Assembly Speaker Laurent Fabius and Education Minister Lionel  Jospin, both presidential contenders, party leaders gathered in Paris beginning  Tuesday evening.  </P> <P> Ideological differences were a factor in the convention debate, mainly between  factions that favor a market-directed, social democratic role for the party  (Fabius, Prime Minister Michel Rocard and European Commission President Jacques  Delors) and those who favor a more traditional leftist model (Jospin, Mauroy  and Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement).  </P> <P> However, most of the fighting was purely political and personal, with eight  government ministers lined up behind Fabius, the 43-year-old French political  wonder-child who is said to have the personal blessing of Mitterrand, and most  of the rest behind Jospin.  </P> <P> The Jospin-Fabius rivalry dates to 1988, when Jospin successfully blocked an  attempt by Mitterrand to install Fabius as party first secretary, replacing  Mauroy. The party secretary position is considered essential for anyone seeking  the nomination to replace Mitterrand if he retires, as expected, in 1995.  </P> <P> Absent from the fray in Rennes was Mitterrand himself, who has had little  direct involvement in the party since he was elected to his second seven-year  term in May, 1988. True to his new nickname in the French press -- Dieu ("God")  -- Mitterrand kept an Olympian distance from the rowdy meeting, sending only a  short greeting wishing them luck in "your convention."  </P> <P> Part of this, one diplomat here noted, is because Mitterrand, who received 54%  of the vote in the 1988 election, is more popular than his own party, which  seldom tops 35% of the vote, and therefore feels no need to be involved in the  daily grit of political life.  </P> <P> However, Michel Martin-Roland, co-author of a new, two-volume political  biography of Mitterrand scheduled for publication in October, said the  president followed the convention closely from home, fearing the unseemly  bickering would damage the party in National Assembly elections in 1993.  </P> <P> "Mitterrand's main priority," said Martin-Roland, "is to have a nice ending to  his second seven-year term. He wants to make sure that the 1993 National  Assembly elections are not a remake of 1986."  </P> <P> That's when the Socialists lost assembly elections and Mitterrand was forced to  rule France in a "cohabitation" with Gaullist Prime Minister Jacques Chirac.  </P> <P> Although Mitterrand favors Fabius, the man many think may benefit most from the  party divisions is Mitterrand's old political rival, Rocard. In every Socialist  convention since 1971, it was Rocard, representing the centrist-right wing of  the party, who was at the center of debates.  </P> <P> This time, the prime minister sat mostly on the sidelines, except for issuing  occasional statements urging party unity. Since he was named prime minister in  1988, Rocard, 59, has been a popular leader, second only to Mitterrand in most  political polls, despite the fact that his Socialist government does not  control a majority of seats in the National Assembly and must count on the  Communists for votes on key issues.  </P> <P> However, he is still resented by Mitterrand purists for his opposition to the  president during previous conventions.  </P></p>

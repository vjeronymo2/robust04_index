			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Underwriter 'told lies' over Names' losses A former underwriter with the Gooda Walker agency was yesterday accused of lying to Lloyd's agents over the likely losses to be sustained by syndicate 298 after the Piper Alpha oil platform disaster. Giving evidence during the High Court action brought by 3,095 Lloyd's Names  -individuals whose wealth has traditionally supported the market - Mr Stanley Andrews was accused of misrepresenting the syndicate's losses to agents and the Gooda Walker board. Mr Jonathan Gaisman, for the Names, said that between January and August 1989, Mr Andrews had repeatedly insisted the syndicate's likely losses would be below the Dollars 104m level at which 298 had arranged reinsurance. He had then continued to tell agents he expected the syndicate to break even, Mr Gaisman said. In April 1989 Mr Andrews reported losses of Dollars 74m, in line with the losses projected in the 1988 audit. The reported figure was Dollars 100m by July and stayed at this level until September. Mr Gaisman said that Mr Derek Walker, the former chairman of the Gooda Walker managing agency, then looked at the syndicate's books and discovered the losses were Dollars 125m. Mr Andrews had manipulated the figures and given untrue figures for projected losses and results to agents, Mr Gaisman said. 'You had not been telling the truth about these figures for months.' The claim was denied by Mr Andrews, who said he had always reported the latest figures available. Mr Gaisman said Mr Andrews had also misled the board about the scale of the losses. Mr Tony Gooda, the former chairman of the members' agency, had told others in early 1989 that Mr Andrews was predicting the syndicate would break even or make a small profit. Mr Andrews said he had never told Mr Gooda that the syndicate might do any better than break even.</p>

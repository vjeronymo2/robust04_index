			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with OECD Secretary General Jean-Claude Paye by </F> unidentified NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter in Tokyo on 5 April;  first paragraph is NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN introduction]    [Text] OECD Secretary General Jean-Claude Paye gave an  interview to a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter in Tokyo on 5  April, during which he pointed out that "there are signs of  economic recovery in Japan." However, he also expressed concern  that if the value of the yen continues to appreciate, exports  will stop growing, and there might be a delay in economic  recovery. He indicated that to expand domestic demand, "the  Japanese Government should implement income tax reductions for  more than one year." Paye also stated during an interview with  KYODO NEWS AGENCY reporters at the Japan National Press Club  that the estimated real economic growth rate of the 24 OECD  members in 1994 (averaging 2.1 percent) "will probably be  revised upward in June."    The following is a summary of the interview with Paye:    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How do you look at the present world  economic situation?    [Paye] It is heading in a good direction. The U.S. economy  is expanding, and the economies of Britain, Canada, and the  other English-speaking OECD members are turning for the better.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the Japanese  economic situation?    [Paye] The economy has hit bottom. Certain signs of  recovery can now be observed. If the yen exchange rate remains  stable, economic recovery can actually be seen within this year.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Are you thinking of revising the  December 1993 projection of economic growth rate of the 24 OECD  member states?    [Paye] We are working on it, and hope to do that in June.  Considering the economic expansion in the United States, we may  have to revise the previous estimate slightly upward.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What do you think is the appropriate  yen exchange rate?    [Paye] It is hard to pinpoint such an exchange rate.  However, if yen appreciation goes any further, exports will  suffer, and this may delay economic recovery.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What steps do you think the Japanese  Government should take to expand domestic demand?    [Paye] It will be important to implement income tax  reductions for more than one year. Some people say the reduced  taxes will only go into savings, but these savings should be  used in investment to stimulate more domestic demand.    Furthermore, to build a consumer-oriented economy, it will  be  necessary to actively relax government regulations.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The United States is asking for  numerical targets to increase Japan's imports as the solution to  bilateral trade frictions.    [Paye] I am against unilateral measures, and laying down  trade rules through bilateral negotiations. I can understand  that the enormous U.S. trade deficit is a problem, but the  solution has to follow multilateral trade rules.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What will be the major items on the  agenda of the OECD ministerial meeting in June?    [Paye] There are three major agenda items. First,  employment. Second, building a better multilateral framework to  deal with economic globalization. Third, promoting cooperation  with China, Russia and other nonmember states. I am looking  forward to the ROK's membership in the OECD in the near future.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] In relation to employment, the  European countries are critical that the economic growth in  Asian countries is built on sacrifices resulting from low wages  paid to the workers.    [Paye] The question of wage level is not a problem for the  OECD, but should be discussed mainly by the International Labor  Organization (ILO). However, personally, I do not think we  should penalize a country for having a wage level lower than the  average wages in OECD countries. Even though such countries may  enjoy a temporary advantage over the advanced nations in terms  of wages, such an advantage will be lost quite rapidly with  economic growth.</p>

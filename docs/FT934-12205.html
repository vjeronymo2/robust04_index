			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of Sri Lanka (16): Short-term outlook still seems bright - Textiles THE growth of Sri Lanka's textiles industry has been impressive. In 1977, textile exports were worth less than Dollars 10m. By the mid 1980s, the figure had soared to Dollars 280m. The real growth in the industry has come in the past three years: in 1990, textiles and clothing exports were worth about Dollars 500m. Last year, earnings from textiles exports rose to Dollars 1.2bn. A healthy 38 per cent growth in the value of textile exports is projected for this year. The rapid expansion of the textiles industry has transformed the Sri Lankan economy. A few years ago, agricultural produce - mainly tea, rubber and coconuts - accounted for the bulk of the country's export earnings. In 1992, textiles accounted for 49 per cent of total export earnings and made up 70 per cent of the value of manufacturing exports. But while the textiles industry has been at the forefront of Sri Lanka's efforts to industrialise its economy there are considerable problems. Sri Lanka has so far failed to build up an industrial base to service its textiles industry. Almost all fabrics, plus many other goods such as zips and buttons, are imported. Imports of textile goods last year were worth more than Dollars 600m - some 50 per cent of the value of total textiles export earnings. Textiles, particularly at the lower, less value-added end of the business, is a notoriously footloose industry. Sri Lanka is deeply concerned about competition from lower cost producers. 'We are watching the emergence of Vietnam very closely,' said an official in the Ministry of Handlooms and Textiles. 'With lower wage rates, Vietnam and Bangladesh could very quickly mount a challenge to our industry.' At present the minimum wage in Sri Lanka's textile industry is SLRs2,000 (about Dollars 40) a month. Buoyed by the success of the textiles industry, the late President Premadasa inaugurated a programme to encourage 200 textile enterprises to open further factories in rural areas. Serious problems of unemployment in country areas would thus be partly alleviated. Those who set up factories under the programme were given considerable tax incentives plus valuable allocations of export quotas. To date, officials say about 120 factories have opened up in the countryside, although how many of these are fully operational is not clear. The programme's contribution to the overall health of the textiles industry is questionable. Some manufacturers complain that they now have to waste considerable amounts of time and money transporting materials to and from remote areas over often very badly maintained roads. Some manufacturers have opened factories in country areas simply to gain more quotas and take advantage of the tax incentives offered. They often still carry out the bulk of production at facilities near Colombo. Industry analysts say the quotas allocation under the 200 factories programme has not been properly supervised. This has caused confusion over quotas with Sri Lanka now producing more than its quota allocation in some categories, less than its allocation in others. There is concern that unless the system is reorganised Sri Lanka could face difficulties in upcoming quota negotiations. Balanced against these problems, the short-term outlook for the textiles industry still seems bright. The industry is beginning to attract some investments in more value-added products. Progress is also being made in developing markets for non quota goods such as skirts, housecoats and nightwear. 'We have to move upmarket; there is no alternative,' said one official. But for the moment, wages remain the critical factor. Competition at the lower end of the textiles market is intense. In these recessionary times textile buyers are looking even more closely at cost cutting. Vietnam and Bangladesh are not the only countries which are challenging Sri Lanka's textile industry. A big US buyer recently decided to stop purchasing from suppliers in Sri Lanka and go instead to the Caribbean, where it could import US-made fabric for finishing and re-export back to the US. 'The next few years should still see industry growth,' said one big manufacturer. 'But I would be far more cautious about the long term.'</p>

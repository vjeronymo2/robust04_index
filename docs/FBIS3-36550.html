Vladimir Kryzhanovskiy told a news conference in Moscow on  Monday that the Ukrainian parliament had now approved all the  points of Article Five of the Lisbon Protocol. "This eliminates  the main problem, and now everything is ready for joining the  Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons in the  immediate future," he said. All nuclear arms will be removed  from Ukraine, he said.    Kryzhanovsky said the Ukrainian legislature had charged the  government with the exchanging of the START-I ratification  instruments and instructed it to take more efforts to enter into  relevant international agreements.    The ambassador did not rule out that Ukraine's membership in  the Nonproliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear state would be  approved by the present parliament, but said this was most  likely to be done by the next legislature, to be elected on  March 27.    Commenting on Ukraine's relations with Russia, Kryzhanovskiy  said there was some friction but that it had set off no  conflicts between the two nations. As for the idea of the  incorporation of the Ukrainian autonomous republic of Crimea  into Russia through a Crimean referendum, he said it would be  the same as the incorporation of Russia's Kuril Islands into  Japan on the basis of the results of a referendum by the Kuril  population. "That's not serious," he said.    He said none of the former Soviet republics, including  Russia, "has given a kopeck" to return Crimean Tatars to Crimea.</p>

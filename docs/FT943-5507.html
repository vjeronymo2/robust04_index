			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Legislation is only course to ensure companies meet specified payment periods Sir, I read with disappointment your editorial on the subject of late payment of debt ('Venturing capital', August 31). We all understand the reluctance to legislate but in order to achieve a level playing field legislation is sometimes the only approach. The enforceability of contracts is the cornerstone of an efficient market economy. At present there is no effective redress against the customer who chooses to pay late, typically by 30 or 40 days. The sums outstanding are vast. We estimate them at Pounds 20bn - equivalent to small business overdraft borrowing. This has a significant impact on the economy and voluntary measures have not worked. After all, it has to be remembered that David Trippier, the then small business minister in 1986, said: 'If these voluntary measures do not help to improve the late payment of the debt situation in this country, then we will not shy away from legislation'. Eight years later we are being told the same thing by Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. It has to be recognised that if legislation were introduced companies may initially extend specified payment periods. However, in general this would merely reflect existing actual payment periods. It is better to know when you will be paid than leave it to the whim of recalcitrant customers. Finally, the Forum of Private Business has been investigating this issue for 10 years. Our claim is that the vast majority of business owners will not be aware of a statutory right to interest but payment periods will improve.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Many observers expressed skepticism about the  seriousness of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's initiative last  week in which he called on his vice president 'Ali Salim al-Bid  to let bygones be bygones and to begin a new chapter of personal  relations between the two men who threw all their weight behind  the establishment of the unitary state on 22 May 1990.    Many people exclude the possibility of any reaction on the  part of Salim al-Bid who was elected by the Presidential Council  members for the post of vice president despite the fact that he  did not come to Parliament in order to take the constitutional  oath.    Al-Bid is still demanding the implementation of the 18  points  which he considers basic conditions before any reconciliatory  steps toward the General People's Congress [GPC] are taken.    Al-Bid, who accused Salih of building a state of tax  collection and military, faced wide criticism by politicians and  the opposition press, accusing him of being secessionist and  helping to implement a foreign plan, and exploiting differences  in order to redivide Yemen. However, President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih in his speech before Parliament after taking the  constitutional oath strongly warned his deputy that "we must  draw up red lines which we should not allow ourselves to cross  whatever the circumstances may be."    Yet the Yemeni crisis is still bogged down despite the  strong  public optimism regarding President 'Al 'Abdallah Salih's recent  initiative. The deadlock in the crisis was demonstrated in the  message al-Bid sent to Parliament, declining to attend the  swearing ceremony because of his personal stand toward President  Salih and YSP [Yemeni Socialist Party] relations with the GPC  party. But al-Bid did not reject the new position and left the  door open for his return to the capital, Sanaa.    When the election battle died down in April some people  thought that Yemen has passed the first test of democracy  following the election of the first popular and legitimate  Parliament through elections in which several parties were  involved, not just one or two parties. It was believed that the  differences between the president and the vice president  concerned the latter's demands for several guarantees for the  YSP while in power, or that power is to be shared according to  the role and status of each party in the field. But 'Ali  al-Bid's going into seclusion in Aden recently exposed all those  differences, thereby demonstrating that the situation in Yemen  is close to collapsing. For the first time, al-Bid openly said  that the conflict is about salvaging what used to be called the  South and restoring the positive advantages it enjoyed, until  the negative effects of what used to be known as the North began  spreading southward.    Some politicians in Yemen see the vice president's recent  stand as based on the outcome of the legislative elections in  which the YSP scored a sweeping victory in the southern  provinces, which led to the creation of a strong bastion for the  socialists who have begun raising issues of the South and  setting its priorities, both in the Presidential Council and the  Parliament.    The situation further aggravated when the speeches of the  president in Sanaa and the vice president in Aden developed into  political polemics, with each one accusing the other of  plundering the state coffers, misappropriating public funds, and  each holding the other responsible for the state the country is  in. This escalation aroused the fear that the unitary state  might come to an end. Some opposition papers expressed the fear  that the differences might lead to the restoration of the border  entry points which existed previously and culminated with the  unification of north and south.    With these serious proposals being openly talked about by  leaders of both parties, the voices advocating secession have  become louder. They point to several factors that can be used as  justifications to go back to secession. These are:     -  The existence of two different currencies in circulation;  the dinar, which was the principal currency in the South, and  the rial in the North (the dinar is worth $26).    -  Failure to take practical steps to merge the armed forces and  the security forces, thus two armies now profess loyalty to the  previous parties, the YSP and the GPC.    -  The existence of two airlines, Alyamda in Aden and  al-Yamaniyah  in Sanaa.    -  The publication of two official newspapers, AL-THAWRAH in  Sanaa  and 14 OCTOBER in Aden.    -  The existence of two television and radio channels in Sanaa  and  Aden.    -  The failure to standardize school curricula and the general  educational system.    -  The feeling among citizens of the South in particular that  unity has worsened their poverty.    Over and above that, political frictions between the GCP and  YSP during the transitional period preceding the elections have  affected a wide sector of the inhabitants of the southern  provinces. Cash liquidity in banks disappeared and for several  months employees received no pay. Also, the project to establish  a free zone in Aden when it was proclaimed the economic and  commercial capital of the country was not implemented.    Despite the gains Yemeni unity achieved and the feeling  among  Yemeni citizens of greater freedom following the termination of  the two totalitarian regimes, lifting restrictions on citizens'  travel, and the existence of freedom in all its forms--these  achievements are no longer a daily demand because hardships  caused by the security and economic situation, particularly  among the southern citizens, overshadowed everything else.    The consensus of views among observers is that Yemen is  living very critical moments due to increasing distrust between  the YSP and GPC leadership. Al-Bid clearly referred to this  situation when he said in an interview with a local paper that  "if we do not understand the meaning of the establishment of the  unitary state, its mechanism, and its major democratic and  contemporary project, then we are afraid that the entity of this  state will break into several entities."</p>

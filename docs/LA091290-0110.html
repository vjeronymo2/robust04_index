			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE;  </P> <P> KMEX TELEVISION'S GENERAL MANAGER RESIGNS  </P> <P> Univision Holdings Inc., the Hallmark Cards subsidiary that owns  Spanish-language KMEX-TV in Los Angeles, said the station's general manager,  Emilio Nicolas Jr., has resigned and been succeeded by Richard P. Ramirez.  </P> <P> Ramirez joined KMEX-TV, Channel 34, in April as general sales manager from  WHCT-TV in Hartford, Conn., where he was general manager and a partner.  </P> <P> Although KMEX-TV has been doing well in ratings, station sources said  management in New York had been increasingly concerned about costs, in  particular losses associated with "L.A. Fiesta Broadway," a Cinco de Mayo  street fair that the station sponsored and broadcast earlier this year.  </P> <P> Nicolas, whose father started what is believed to be the nation's first  Spanish-language station in San Antonio, said he hoped to remain in the  broadcasting field.

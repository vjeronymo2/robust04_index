			<p>BFN     [Text] Today at Mulindi the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]  delegation headed by the RPF president, Colonel Alexis  Kanyarengwe, met two UN representatives, Iqbal Riza and General  Bakili. The RPF president talks about the subject of the  meeting:    [Unidentified correspondent] You have just met members of a  UN delegation. What was the purpose of the meeting?    [Kanyarengwe] As you heard recently, the UN Security Council  recently resolved to send troops to Rwanda to assist the war-  affected people. Today we were discussing the modalities of the  coming of the force, on whether we accept its arrival and  facilitate its mission.    [Correspondent] What was the outcome of the discussions?    [Kanyarengwe] Concerning how the force will come, we reached  an understanding, but the countries composing the force will  have to be agreed upon first. The other thing we agreed on is  that the force will only deal with humanitarian assistance. It  will help the relief organizations which are feeding people, and  will stand guard due to the uncertainty related to the  Interahamwe [Republican National Movement for Democracy and  Development militias] who (?are killing) innocent people. The  force will rescue such endangered people by taking them to safe  places where it can protect them.</p>

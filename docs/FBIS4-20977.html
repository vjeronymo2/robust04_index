			<p>to   Drug Traffickers   <F P=102> PY2503234294 Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 16 Mar 94 p A4 </F> <F P=103> PY2503234294 </F> <F P=104>  Lima EL COMERCIO </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Unconfirmed" column] </F>   [Text] Congressman Manuel Moreyra Loredo (Sode)  [Solidarity and Democracy] has asked Andres Reggiardo Sayan  (NM-C90) (New Majority-Change 90), the CCD (Democratic  Constituent Congress) Defense and Domestic Order Committee  chairman, to summon EP (Peruvian Army) General Nicolas Hermoza  Rios, the Armed Forces Joint Command chairman.    The goal of summoning Hermoza is to have him explain the  charges filed by EP Major Evaristo Castillo Aste (Ret) and EP  Captain Ricardo Falconi Alvarez (Ret) on alleged support  supplied by bad military elements to notorious drug traffickers  and their ties.    Moreyra's petition makes us recall what happened a few  months  ago when, summoned by the CCD Human Rights Committee chaired at  that time by Roger Caceres (FNTC) (Workers and Peasants National  Front), Hermoza Rios flatly denied that any Army members had  anything to do with the disappearance of nine students and a  professor from La Cantuta University and claimed that those who  disputed his denial were conducting a campaign against our  country's guardian institution. The following day the tanks  were out on the streets.    Maybe recalling this event, Moreyra makes it clear that his  proposal is based "solely and exclusively on the fact that the  bad elements who are wearing uniforms our country has given them  and are openly--and with impunity--acting against national  interests, degrading their institution, must be thoroughly  investigated and exemplarily punished to safeguard the image,  credibility, and respect of our Armed Forces."</p>

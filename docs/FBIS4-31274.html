			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "No Guarantee of Rights; On the Position of </F> the Slovak Minority in Poland"]    [Text] Warsaw--An estimated 15,000-20,000 Slovaks live in  Poland at present. But the number of those who no longer  identify with their Slovak origin is twice as large. However,  the Slovak minority in Poland does not represent a problem on  the scale, for example, of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia.  "During the reform of the entire state administration, we were  practically left to our own devices. We do not have any rights  guaranteed by the Constitution and a law on minorities does not  exist in Poland," Lubomir Molitoris, secretary of the Central  Committee of the Cultural and Social Association of Czechs and  Slovaks in Poland, said about the present position of the Slovak  minority in Poland.    Some protection is somewhat noticeable in the sphere of  education, where a Ministry of Education decree is in force on  the principles of minority education and maintaining a national  identity.</p>

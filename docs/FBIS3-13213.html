Members of the delegation offered their condolences  on the nation's loss of Staff Major Engineer Paratrooper Basil  al-Asad. The president thanked the members of the delegation  for their noble sentiments and sincere condolences.    The president welcomed the members of the delegation. He  said: Syria is your country. The more brothers are away from  each other the more they miss each other. When I say that Syria  is your country, it is not that this is a favor from me, or that  I expect anything in return, it is a reality. These are our  feelings regardless of the political and geographical reality.    You all know about history and the sentiments of the Syrians  and their pan-Arab view. All the Arab boundaries we are living  under are fabricated boundaries and this is a fact. Life itself  shows the continuation of pan-Arab ties are stronger than any  other ties. I believe that whoever says otherwise will be  contradicting history's course and facts, and the development of  human life.    If there are people who claim that this is an exaggeration,  then they do not at all express the Arab citizens' sentiments  and logic. There are many nations, not just one, with different  histories and language that are trying to come closer to each  other.    There has been a great deal of talk about interests during  this historical stage and in light of international changes.  This word became a popular term, as if it is everything. We  say that when we talk about interests, we mean all interests.  We do not only mean economic interests. We mean economic  interests as well as mutual sentiments and culture and tradition.    The president also spoke about the history of, and  developments in, the Arab-Israeli conflict. He said that the  media in Israel always says that Syria is threatening Israel's  security. He added that even during the peace talks, the  Israelis talked about this. Some foreigners who visit us talk  about the Golan and how it is a threat to Israel's security. We  refer them to the UN Charter and the resolutions of the United  Nations Truce Supervision Organization dealing with clashes on  the Syrian-Israeli front since 1948. With the exception of one  or two resolutions, on which there are differences, there are  more than one hundred resolutions that condemn Israel.    The president talked about the Middle East peace process. He  said: We hope to God that peace, which we and the world are  talking about, will be achieved. In fact, Syria is the one that  opened the door to peace. After the 1973 war, we accepted  Resolution 338 and its main pillar, Resolution 242. In our  written interpretation of this resolution to the United Nations  we said that we accept the resolution on the basis that it means  withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and securing the  rights of the Palestinian Arab people. Meanwhile, Israel did  not accept Resolution 338 under the pretext that Syria read in  it something that was not there. In the end, however, they  agreed to a cease-fire on this basis.    We have a strong stand in terms of arguments, resolutions,  and logic. Our stand does not leave much room for the logic of  others. You all know that many initiatives have been launched  since 1973. Finally, there was the U.S. peace initiative, which  in our opinion was the best initiative -- one that is clear and  based on the principles that have always been reiterated by the  Arab side. These principles call for the exchange of land for  peace, based on Resolutions 242 and 338. We always said that we  wanted a peace based on the UN Security Council resolutions,  which stipulate a full withdrawal from the occupied Arab  territories, and the rights of the Palestinian Arab people. All  of this was stressed during our talks with the delegations that  have visited us from the countries that have contacted us. The  U.S. initiative came in response to this issue.    You recall that before Syria replied to the U.S.  initiative, Shamir gave his rejection and sent a letter to the  U.S. President at the time making the rejection clear. As for  us, after we saw positive points in the initiative, we said that  we agreed to it. It goes without saying that Shamir was not in  a good position when we accepted it. At the beginning, Shamir  believed that by rejecting the initiative, he would be  obstructing the peace process. But, the reply of Syria and the  Arab side embarrassed him a great deal and the peace process was  launched.    Shamir and his government stepped down without him ever  saying to the Americans that he agreed to their initiative. All  the attempts and efforts of the Americans succeeded only in  making him agree to participate in the Madrid conference,  without agreeing to the initiative as a whole.    During all the time that Shamir's government remained in  power, no progress was achieved and not one step was made in the  peace talks. Then came the present Israeli government under  Yitzhaq Rabin with the slogan of peace that it raised. We said:  This augurs well. The truth is that the atmosphere of the  talks improved with its advent, but the talks themselves did not  improve or progress. The Israeli side continued to evade  discussing any topic dealing with substance. They started to  get closer to essential issues. However, no progress was  achieved. They said they would submit new ideas. But,  actually, they were new demands submitted to the Arab side. So  long as the matter did not deal with substance, we used to give  and take and to make initiatives. But on substance, there is no  possibility for compromise or placation. Substance remains  substance. Syria has offered a great deal since the beginning  of the peace process. On the opposite side, the Israeli  government has not offered anything to push the peace process  ahead. Syria used to take initiatives, make proposals, and  submit steps the Israelis themselves said were positive.  Sometimes they even described them as important, but they  always used to say that more is needed. After the talks  started, Syria submitted the first written paper. It was a  document the Americans described as a historic document. The  Israeli side described it as very important. However, in the  next session with the Syrian delegation, they said: This is good  but not sufficient. After some time we offered peace in  exchange for land. They said: This is good, but not good  enough.    Our foreign minister then proposed complete peace for  complete withdrawal. They said: This too is good, but unclear.  They continued to submit other things that have nothing to do  with the peace process. Thus, matters used to go backward.    Israel's stands in all the discussions on the peace process  are stands that say: Give and keep giving. Recently, the  European Union chairman visited us. I told him that Israel  tries to carry out blackmail. It gives nothing, and wants to  discuss security and all issues in which it alone is interested,  saying the others have to wait. These are impossible demands.  The Israelis have submitted matters that are very far from the  peace process. That's why no progress was achieved. I believe  that several Western countries consider Israel an element  hampering the peace process. As for our stand, it has become  clear to the Americans, the Russians, and all the people that we  want a complete and comprehensive peace. If peace is not  comprehensive, one cannot describe it as peace. We, the Arabs  are one nation even if there is enmity between us.    The Americans are now really talking about a comprehensive  peace and they have convictions about this. Our relations with  the United States now are much better than before. Had the  issue merely been Syrian-American relations, there would have  not been any problems. We have great doubts that Israeli  officials do not seek peace. We have doubts, but we have not  reached any final conviction. Such a matter will be either  proven or disproven by time.    We seriously seek peace, and the Israeli officials know  this.  We really want peace, while they only speak about peace. In  light of what they are proposing, it seems that their vision of  peace is not the same as ours. Therefore, we will struggle  until their peace becomes identical with our peace. Our position  is very strong because we are the owners of rights.  International changes will not force us to retreat. Peace  means rights. In other words, each party has its rights and  each party is the master of itself and its interests. This is  our understanding of peace. When we said the peace of the  brave, we meant that each party will achieve full peace with all  its rights, and that each party will not humiliate the other.    Addressing the delegation, the president said: I warmly  thank you for your visit to offer condolences on the death of my  son. As I said a few days ago, my son is like the rest of the  citizens. He might have had skills that do not exist in one of  his colleagues, as happens in every place and in every family.  Except for the human feelings placed by God in people, all my  sons in Syria are equal to me. When my sons were still children  living with me at home, I always pushed them to the front to be  ready, like all Syrians, to defend the homeland, the Arabs'  rights, and the interests of the Arab nation. The loss of any  skilled person whether here, in the Gulf, or in the Maghreb is a  loss for everyone and for the homeland. I, as well as the  citizens, viewed the tragedy from this angle. If you saw the  Syrian citizens during the past days you saw the emotional  participation of our people. I know our people and their stands  in all events and circumstances -- it is the same stand in the  face of all kinds of difficulties, all kinds of aggression, and  all that take place in accordance God's will. If the deceased  can know what happens after his death -- and this means knowing  unseen things -- our son will be happy for meeting his brothers  who came from Palestine [which was occupied in] 1948.    [Text] 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah spoke for the delegation,  saying: We are pleased to hear this pan-Arab position you have  just expressed. We have always been eager to meet with your  excellency to hear these positions, which we have followed  closely. We strongly support this position because it expresses  the Arab nation's dignity, the Arab conscience, and the cause of  freedom which cannot be divided anywhere.    On this occasion, please allow me to deliver a brief speech  in the name of the delegation's members to offer our warm  condolences to our brother His Excellency Syrian President Hafiz  al-Asad, to his honorable family, to the Syrian Government, and  to the fraternal Syrian people on the death of Staff Major  Basil, whose death is a loss for the whole Arab nation. O Your  Excellency the President: We share with you this disaster with  our feelings, minds, and hearts because we are the sons of this  nation and we are an indivisible part of the Palestinian people  and the Arab nation.    We came to express our sincere feelings and to offer  condolences to your excellency. At the same time, we are pound  of Syria's positions under your wise, rational, and brave  leadership. We also appreciate these positions and realize that  this sound, nationalist, and sincere pan-Arab position that you  adopt may be the key to a just and comprehensive solution to the  dispute in the region -- a solution you have called the peace of  the brave. We also adopt the formula you have been proposing --  the peace of the courageous that which will guarantee rights to  every nation. Otherwise, peace cannot be achieved.    We know that there is an essential contradiction between the  occupation and the cause of peace. Therefore, we urge the  Israeli Government persistently and strongly through the Knesset  and the political map inside Israel to carry out a full  withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories; namely, the West  Bank, the Gaza Strip, the occupied Syrian Golan, southern  Lebanon, and the occupied Jordanian territories, and to  recognize the Palestinian people's right to self-determination  and the establishment of their independent state.    We say this knowing that there is an Arab will that Your  Excellency expressed during your meeting with President Clinton  in Geneva. There, you represented the Arab nation. Our hearts  were with you, and when you met with President Clinton, you, O  Your Excellency the President, were representing the whole Arab  nation and not just Syria's position.    We value the position of militant Syria, the bastion of  Arabism, which is striving to achieve the unity of this nation.  We are for inter-Arab coordination. We would like to say, with  all honesty, that inter-Arab coordination can help our Arab  nation restore its rights and ensure a just and comprehensive  solution, because a fragmented Arab position cannot help us  achieve the accomplishments we seek. It is possible to achieve  peace when Israel faces a well-coordinated and harmonious Arab  stand. We are well aware that there are conflicting forces  operating within the Israeli political spectrum. There are  pro-peace forces that have recently staged demonstrations to  protest the heinous Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. Tens of thousands  of people, including us, took part in these demonstrations.  They demonstrated against the killings, and also to call for  the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace.    The Israeli Government, however, has thus far failed to  provide any cogent proof or evidence, in terms of practices, as  you have just said, to show the entire world community, the Arab  nation, and us, as citizens, that its position is sound. That  is why we have demanded that the Israeli Government declare a  willingness to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories.    With regard to the issue of peace between Syria and Israel,  the formula raised by President Mubarak and Foreign Minister  Faruq al-Shar', namely, the formula of full withdrawal in return  for full peace, we would like to say that we are attempting to  promote this formula within the Israeli political spectrum so  that Israeli political forces may support this formula, and so  that they may express full support for complete withdrawal from  the Golan in return for a peace agreement.    Of late, many people in Israel have begun to express stands  supportive of this formula. The number of people supporting  this formula is increasing. Likewise, the Israeli Government is  required to take practical measures toward the sons of our  Palestinian people in the occupied territories, who are  suffering from repression, torture, and heinous massacres.  Thousands of martyrs have fallen, not to mention tens of  thousands of wounded and detainees. Almost, each and every  Palestinian house in the West Bank and Gaza Strip has lost a  martyr, has had a wounded person, or has had a prisoner held in  Israeli jails. Hence, we call upon Israeli rulers to change  their policy toward our Palestinian people.    Mr. President, I would like to reiterate again that we, the  Palestinians who have continued to live in Israel proper since  1948, are committed to our Arab nationalism, to our true  Arabism, to our Palestinian identity; and that we have neither  succumbed, nor accepted humiliation. We have not been brought  to our knees. With regard to Syria's position, which you have  just explained, we share the same position with you. To us, you  are a good example. How can the struggle battle be waged,  except with heads held high with dignity and pride? Hence, I,  on behalf of our people, who are represented by this delegation,  salute you. This delegation came to Syria to extend to you our  fraternal condolences on our people's behalf, and also to clasp  your hand in your persistent march, and in your constant  struggle to achieve the Arab nation's objectives. We are well  aware that Syria, under your leadership, is working to promote  the Arab nation's interests, to serve the Palestine question,  and to protect the dignity of this nation, and not only to  promote the Golan issue, which is confined to Syrian territory.  Rather, you seek the restoration of all Arab rights.    Given all this, we clasp your hands and beseech God Almighty  to protect you, to grant you continued good health, and to  render the march you are leading for the sake of Syria, which we  deem our second home, a success. We take pride in Syria, in its  president, in its leader, in its symbol, in its people, and in  its government. Similarly, we hope that the Syrian people, our  Palestinian people, and our Arab nation will achieve prosperity  and progress.    Concluding my talk, I would like to ask all brothers to read  the opening chapter of the Koran to invoke God's mercy on the  souls of the martyrs of the entire Arab nation, the Syrian  martyrs, the Palestinian martyrs, and the martyrs of the  Ibrahimi Mosque, and also on the soul of the valiant youth Basil  al-Asad, whose death was a loss to all of us.    A delegation member posed the following question to his  excellency the president: When will the Syrian-Israeli  negotiations be resumed? And what are Syria's conditions for a  resumption of the negotiations? Yitzhaq Rabin has repeatedly  said that he wants a summit meeting with President Hafiz al-Asad  to accelerate the peace process? How would you respond to this  request?    His excellency the president answered this question, saying:  We have an authorized negotiating team that holds negotiations  with the Israeli delegation. This team is very reliable. When  they make progress, we will discuss any requirements or  prerequisites of the peace process. Nonetheless, the  delegations have continued to mark time. Once they make  headway, we will discuss any additional requirements, if there  are any.    Another delegation member addressed the following question:  Mr. Rabin always reacts to your statements. The idea you are  promoting concerns the attainment of comprehensive and true  peace in return for an Israeli withdrawal from all Arab  territories. In reply to this, Rabin says that the extent of  withdrawal must be commensurate with the scope of peace offered.  My question is the following: What is the scope of the peace  you are speaking of?    His excellency the president answered this question, saying:  Why have you not asked him about the extent of withdrawal he is  speaking of. We have explained the kind of peace we are  offering; that is, full peace. As for Rabin, he has not  mentioned full withdrawal. There must be equilibrium. Were I in  your shoes, I would pose this question to him. He has not  mentioned full withdrawal.    A third delegation member asked the following question: The  Syrian-Israeli dialogue is a political dialogue. It is moving  slowly at present. For how long will Syria remain engaged in  this dialogue if it deems it a waste of time?    His excellency the president answered this question, saying:  Until we reach the conviction that there is no room for a just  peace.</p>

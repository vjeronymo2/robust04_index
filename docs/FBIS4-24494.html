			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Flor Wang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 28 (CNA) -- The Taipei-based Straits  Exchange Foundation (SEF) on Saturday [28 May] sent a written  message to Mainland China's Association for Relations Across the  Taiwan Strait (ARATS) proposing negotiations be held in early  June between the two sides on cross-strait travel security.    SEF, the quasi-official organization in charge of civilian  affairs between Taiwan and Mainland China, said in the message  that the March 31 Qiandao Lake disaster and its mishandling by  mainland authorities underscored the lack of an effective and  immediate communication channel between the two sides when an  accident occurs.    Amid public outrage and criticism over the incident in  Taiwan, SEF said the two sides should hold talks to devise a  formula for Taiwan-Mainland China travel security, and to build  a safer environment for cross-strait travel.    In addition to the travel security issue, SEF, on May 25,  proposed to hold negotiations with ARATS in early June on  compensation for the 24 Taiwan tourists killed in the Qiandao  Lake incident, but ARATS has yet to respond to the request.</p>

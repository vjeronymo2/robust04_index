			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Antonio Martinez] </F>   [Excerpt] Quito, 1 Feb (EFE) -- Today, protests over the  gasoline price increases of up to 71 percent caused renewed  disturbances in several Ecuadoran cities. Additionally, students  announced a nationwide strike for tomorrow and another by labor  unions on Thursday.    In Quito and other cities, there have been demonstrations  every day since last Thursday, prior to the government's  announcement of the price increases on Friday. At least 10  policemen and an undisclosed number of youths have either been  wounded or injured. According to the local press, approximately  60 students have been arrested during clashes with the police.    Several student organizations have scheduled a nationwide  strike tomorrow and the United Workers Front (FUT), Ecuador's  most influential labor union, has summoned all sectors to a  strike on Thursday. Indian associations, teachers unions and  other organizations support the FUT strike.    The transportation sector has also warned the government  that it will join the strike if state subsidies are not  increased since the sector has been banned from raising bus  fares.    Thursday's strike will be the third nationwide strike by  labor unions against Sixto Duran-Ballen's conservative  government since he took office in 1992.    FUT President Edgar Ponce warned that if the government  refuses to take the protests into consideration and maintains  its decision to increase gasoline prices, the FUT will call an  "indefinite" strike on a later date. Ponce says the government's  economic policy could prompt a "social explosion" in Ecuador  like those in Chiapas (Mexico) and Santiago del Estero  (Argentina).    Without joining the calls for a strike, business  organizations, professional associations, opposition parties,  and even certain deputies from the ruling party have also  protested.    Former President Leon Febres Cordero (1984-88), mayor of  Guayaquil, the most densely populated city in the country,  described the increased prices as "crazy," and he said Ecuador  is now "the poorest country on earth with the most expensive  gasoline on earth."

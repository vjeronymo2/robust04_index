			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / An anchor in an unstable Europe: Growing nationalism and the end of the east- west conflict make Maastricht and eventual union all the more vital We Germans have particular reason to be thankful for European integration. Our experience provides us with a powerful incentive for the future. After the ending of the cold war and the reunification of Germany, we remain resolutely committed to continuing the process of European unification. We have more neighbours than any other country in Europe. So we have a fundamental national interest in creating a European Union to which, one day, all our neighbours will belong. Within western Europe, the European Community has played a decisive role in helping overcome traditional rivalries and policies of national egoism. In this part of the continent, war has become impossible. We are now enjoying the longest period of peace since the mid-19th century. The second world war broke out 21 years after the first; and this came 43 years after the Franco-Prussian war and the foundation of the German Reich. We are now in the 48th continuous year of peace, in the certain knowledge that this state of affairs will continue. We share with all Europeans the fundamental concern that national interests should never again spark off armed conflict. Despite all these reasons for optimism, I doubt whether the evil spirits of the past, which have brought us Europeans so much suffering this century, have really been banished for good. No one should be under the illusion that the spectre of European nationalism has been finally laid to rest, or that this ugly apparition is confined only to the Balkans. In many parts of the east of our continent, we are starting to see a return of nationalist thinking, of intolerance and even chauvinism. Even western Europe is not immune to such temptations. I feel myself carried back to an ill-fated past when I hear some people stirring up public sentiment with the argument that Germany has become too large and too powerful, and therefore needs to be 'contained' by means of coalitions. It is a cruel irony that this kind of talk plays into the hands of precisely those forces, not least in Germany, which propagate old-style nationalism. However, the lessons of the past, and Germany's particular geographical position, represent simply one side of the story. We all need European Union to master the great challenges of today and tomorrow. Only if Europe pools its energies and speaks with one voice can it bring its weight to bear in a fitting manner. Europe can hold its own in worldwide competition with Japan and North America only if it acts as one. Particularly for great export nations like Germany and Britain, this is of the utmost importance. Following the end of the east-west conflict, Germany and the rest of Europe are facing fresh challenges. The upheaval in central, eastern and south-eastern Europe has brought great risks and uncertainties. Because of this, Europe as a whole, more than ever before, needs a firm and secure anchor. Only a strong European Community can fulfil this role. The Maastricht treaty represents, not least, our combined answer to the new situation in Europe. With it, we are facing up to our responsibilities for the future of the entire continent. I know that the far-reaching changes in Europe during the past few years have unsettled many people, in Germany and elsewhere. They wonder whether the pace of change has been too fast; whether the Maastricht treaty came too soon, and in too ambitious a form. My answer to these doubters is this: can we afford to go more slowly? We Germans have already seen, in reunifying our country, the crucial importance of seizing a unique opportunity with energy and enterprise. The same spirit must guide us now in the task of achieving European unity. That was why it was so important that at the recent Edinburgh summit, under the presidency of UK Prime Minister John Major, the leaders of the European Community expressed their sympathy for Denmark's special reservations, but decided not to change the Maastricht treaty. Reopening negotiations was not, and is not, on our agenda. In Edinburgh we therefore could go no further than to clarify the relevant treaty clauses to respond to the main Danish concerns. This purely declaratory 'decision' neither changes nor complements the treaty, and therefore does not require ratification by member states. I believe that, as a result, the way is now clear for the Danes to hold a new referendum this spring. We all want the EC to develop further as a Community of the 12. I am against the idea of a two- or three-speed Europe. But I would add just as clearly that, in view of the importance of European Union for us Germans, we cannot accept that the speed of European integration will be dictated by the slowest ship in the convoy. From time to time, we hear objections that the Maastricht treaty does not give a clear enough picture of what tomorrow's Europe should actually look like. This was not, however, the aim of the treaty, nor could it be. Maastricht was an interim step, albeit an important one, on the road to European Union. The parts of the treaty dealing with political union are just as important as those concerning economic and monetary union. Everyone in Europe must realise that we can preserve all our economic achievements only if we also secure them politically. An economic union will survive only if it is based on a political union. The Maastricht treaty is not only fundamentally important for the EC itself. It also sends a signal of hope beyond the borders of today's Community. On the basis of Maastricht, the EC at Edinburgh decided to start entry negotiations with Austria, Sweden and Finland at the beginning of this year. With Norway, talks are expected to get under way in March. Our aim is to complete these talks as quickly as possible, so that these countries can join the EC in 1995. However, the Poles and Hungarians, the Czechs and Slovaks, and many other peoples and nations in central, eastern and south-eastern Europe, place their hopes in the European Community. We must not disappoint them. Beyond this, another important task is to forge close and trusting relations between the European Community and the states of the former Soviet Union. We must do all we can to shape European policy in such a manner that people can identify with it more easily. They must be able to sense that we are building a Europe not of bureaucrats and technocrats, removed from the people, but one which is working in the people's interests. This must also be a key principle for the single market, which took effect on January 1. In Edinburgh we adopted guidelines and criteria for applying the principle of subsidiarity - making decisions as close as possible to the people. And we also took concrete steps to review existing regulations, and to revoke those which clearly contradict the subsidiarity principle. For this purpose the Commission has drawn up an initial list, by no means exhaustive, which is included in the European Council's conclusions. Dealing with this list will be a prime task for the Commission and Council in the first half of 1993. We have thus made a start in reversing what is popularly seen as the EC's 'regulatory mania'. Of course, the fault does not lie only with 'Brussels'. National governments and authorities must accept their duty to become more responsive to their citizens' needs, and not simply to pass on unpleasant matters to the Community. Much public irritation is caused by European regulations which are really the result of national initiatives - often for economic reasons, to protect national interests. Here we must recognise that errors have been made in the past, and make the necessary adjustments. Cases such as these, where in accord with the principle of subsidiarity Community action is not necessary, can offer some overall lessons for our journey towards a Europe which will be stronger, more prosperous and more stable for all of us - in the east and the west.</p>

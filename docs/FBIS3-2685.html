			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 11 (XINHUA) -- The ongoing Second  Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) held its  second meeting here today, hearing reports on the country's  economic and social development as well as the state budget.    At the meeting presided over by Wang Bingqian, an executive  chairman of the session Presidium, Chen Jinhua, minister in  charge of the State Planning Commission, delivered a report on  the implementation of the 1993 plan for national economic and  social development and a similar draft plant for 1994. Liu  Zhongli, minister of finance, made a report on the  implementation of the 1993 state budget and a draft state budget  for 1994.    Chen Jinhua said in 1993 China's social production continued  to increase rapidly, with its gross domestic product (GDP)  reaching 3,138 billion yuan, up 13.4 percent over the previous  year. Investment in fixed assets nationwide reached 1,182.9  billion yuan, up 50.6 percent over the previous year, or 22  percent with inflation taken into account.    Chen listed major macro-control targets for the 1994  national  economic and social development plan, which, he said, has taken  into consideration both requirements for a sustained, rapid and  healthy economic development and the necessity to create a  relaxed environment for implementing various major reforms to be  carried out this year.    Liu Zhongli told more than 2,800 deputies that total state  revenues in 1993 came to 511.482 billion yuan, up 23.2 percent  over the previous year, while total state expenditures amounted  to 531.982 billion yuan, up 21.2 percent over the 1992 figure.  This resulted in a deficit of 20.5 billion yuan, which was not  in excess of the budgeted figure.    While revenues and expenditures in local finances increased  considerably in 1993, those in central finances failed to reach  budgeted figures. Moreover, although revenues in local finances  increased substantially, turnover tax revenues in central  finances were much less than the budgeted figure, thereby  aggravating the difficulties of central finances, Liu said.    Therefore, he added, this year's state budget has again been  drafted according to the principle of tightening control over  expenditures, with a view to maintaining a basic balance between  total supply and total demand and alleviating inflationary  pressures.    Under the circumstances, the guiding ideology for drafting  the 1994 state budget has been to continue to strengthen and  improve macro controls, work hard to open up new revenue  sources, improve the economic performance of enterprises and  make revenue increases commensurate with economic development,  the minister noted.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] Presidential Spokesman Raymond Tai [Tai Jui-ming]  was quoted as saying on Monday [4 April] that President Li  Teng-hui's visits to foreign countries are intended to expand  the ROC's [Republic of China] diplomatic relations, not to  promote a divided China.    The president is scheduled to visit Costa Rica and South  Africa for presidential inauguration ceremonies next month. It  will be his second overseas trip this year.    Tai told reporters that President Li's visit abroad is to  seek international cooperation so as to help decrese the  hostility between Taiwan and the mainland. He was quoted as  saying Taiwan and the mainland should act like brothers, not  like father and son, and the two sides should help each other  bring about a new China. Regarding his recent trips to the  Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand, Tai said the trip was not  meant to poison relations between Peking [Beijing] and the three  nations. Instead, Tai stressed, Taiwan is seeking more economic  cooperation with those countries.</p>

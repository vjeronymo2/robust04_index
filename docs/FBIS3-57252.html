			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Irina Litvinova report: "Only Latvian `Citizens' Have </F> Right To Spy"]    [Text] Riga -- The Latvian Seimas has adopted a "law on  operational activity," whole sections of which provide broad  scope for the special services. Correspondence can be monitored  and secretly copied, conversations can be bugged, and people can  be followed.    Operational activity relies on "cooperation with the  population." Those who used to be called "informers" are now  known as "secret assistants." Here too there was no getting  away from the division between the rights of Latvian "citizens"  and "noncitizens" (who comprise one-third of the population).  Only "citizens" can collect information on other persons,  facts, and cases -- in other words, become "secret assistants."</p>

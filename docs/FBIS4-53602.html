			<p>BFN     [Text] MANILA, May 20 (AFP) -- President Fidel Ramos said  Friday that foreign participants of a planned human rights  conference on East Timor, opening in Manila later this month,  would be banned from entering the Philippines. Their presence  at the privately organized May 31-June 3 meeting would be  "inimical to the national interest," a presidental palace  statement said.    The regional conference had sparked a diplomatic row between  Manila and Jakarta, with the latter threatening retaliation if  it takes place. Ramos cited the planned participation of Jose  Ramos-Horta, a special representative of the East Timor  resistance. He ordered Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon to  "take immediate steps to exclude such persons and other  non-Filipino conferees."    On Thursday, Indonesia, angry at the East Timor seminar, had  threatened to scrap a meeting it had organised between Manila  and group of Filipino Moslem rebels. The meeting is due to take  place next month.</p>

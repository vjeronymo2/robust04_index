			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOCCER;  </P> <P> COLOMBIANS REJECT EXTRA SECURITY  </P> <P> Having determined that death threats against its coach, players and their  families were unfounded, the Colombian Soccer Federation rejected an offer for  extra security during the team's stay in Los Angeles this week for the Marlboro  Cup.  </P> <P> "It's more difficult to play soccer with bodyguards all over the place,"  Colombia Coach Francisco Maturana said Monday. "We want to get (the threats)  out of our minds."  </P> <P> He said the players should turn their attention to soccer, starting tonight  when Colombia meets the Soviet Union at 7 in a match between World Cup  qualifiers. Another World Cup qualifier, Costa Rica, plays a Mexican  professional team, Chivas of Guadalajara, at 9.  </P> <P> The winners will play for the championship Thursday night after a match between  the losers for third place. All games are scheduled for the Coliseum.  </P> <P> A group calling itself Purge Colombian Soccer issued the threats two weeks ago  against Maturana as well as national team members who are under contract to  professional teams allegedly connected with the drug cartels and their  families. Most of the national team players also are members of the four teams  specified. The group reportedly lost money betting on those teams.  </P> <P> During a break in the team's schedule, Colombia's president, Virgilio Barco,  instructed the country's security minister, General Miguel Maza, to  investigate. When it was determined that the team was not in danger, the  players gathered last week at Boca Raton, Fla., to train for this tournament,  and the president of the soccer federation, Leon Londono Tamayo, went to Italy  to assure organizers that Colombia will participate in this summer's World Cup.  </P> <P> "There was a lot of uncertainty, rumors and doubt," Maturana said through an  interpreter. "The situation still isn't ideal, but it has calmed down."  </P> <P> Maturana, who coached Colombia into the World Cup for the first time in 28  years, denied reports that he considered resigning because of the threats. He  said the team will continue training as scheduled except for the cancellation  of games in Colombia.  </P> <P> The Soviets are making their first appearance in the United States. After this  tournament, they play the United States on Saturday at Stanford.  </P></p>

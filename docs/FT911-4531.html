			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Volatile trading in NatWest THE performance of NatWest Bank confounded the market. The stock eased back for much of the session, then dipped sharply after bad news from its US subsidiary, before staging an about-turn late in the session. Dealers took a bearish tack at the outset, marking the stock down to around 327p, amid worries that first quarter figures from NatWest Bancorp, the US arm, would be below the Dollars 75m-Dollars 150m loss range forecast by City analysts. Also acting as a drag was a bearish appraisal of the banking sector, especially NatWest, published by the bank's own securities arm, County NatWest. County said the sector was 10-15 per cent overvalued. It seemed unlikely that the UK banks would be able to fund their own requirements and that deterioration in balance-sheet ratios might prompt fears of rights issues, which would in turn damage share performance First-quarter figures from Bancorp came out at a loss of Dollars 191m and when NatWest shares dropped to 323p, heavy buying from institutions reversed the trend and left the stock a net 4 higher at 335p. Turnover reached 3.4m. Dilution worries Short-term factors continued to unsettle Smiths Industries, the first being renewed concern about the extra research and development costs involved in the Dollars 700m contract awarded last week by Boeing. The development of new systems for the US manufacturer's B777 aircraft could amount to Pounds 10m a year, say analysts, and may hold back profits in the next three years until revenue flow begins. Another worry was the prospect of further short-term dilution if the group used its cash pile of some Pounds 120m on an acquisition. The group tends to follow a policy of longer-term expansion and, in the near term, profit margins could come under pressure. The shares moved against the market, falling to 270p before ending 4 down on balance at 272p. Glaxo recommended Glaxo led pharmaceuticals higher as Kleinwort Benson said the shares were oversold, while a presentation in the health and household sector at S. G. Warburg attracted attention to the whole sector. The shares have been hit in recent days by the prospect of a law suit challenging one of the patents on Glaxo's Zantac, the world's best-selling drug. Mr Ian White at Kleinwort said this presented a short-term buying opportunity and the shares rose 15 to 1100p. Glaxo had also been affected by switching from SmithKline Beecham, which continued to benefit from presentations to analysts on Monday in London and on Friday in New York. Traders said there was still an overhang of buying from the US encouraged by the recently strong dollar. In a shortage of stock, SmithKline was squeezed 13 to 831p. The good sentiment spilt over into Fisons, 11 1/2 better at 481p, and Reckitt and Colman, which closed 32 to the good at 1547p as traders spoke of a shortage of stock. Kleinwort Benson was involved in the oil sector, re-affirming their strong buy stance on British Gas and also issuing a detailed buy note on Ultramar. Kleinwort said British Gas shares already discounted even the most severe adjustment to the gas pricing formula from the industry watchdog, Ofgas. 'Unless it's a real hammer blow the shares will go up,' said Mr Philip Lambert at Kleinwort. Gas settled 5 1/2 firmer at 357p on 5.7m. Ultramar added 7 at 330p. Racal Telecom advanced strongly, boosted primarily by a buy note from UBS Philips &amp; Drew, but also by revived speculation that a bid could be imminent for Racal Electronics before the latter's demerger of Telecom, expected this summer. Talk of a bid from Cable &amp; Wireless, on its own or in conjunction with Mannesman and Hutchison Whampoa, has been in the market for some time. UBS said Racal Telecom was its only buy recommendation in UK telecoms, describing it as the premier play on long term growth in mobile telecoms. Telecom closed 12 up at 393p and Electronics 8 1/2 higher at 241 1/2 p. GEC, restrained by yet more profits downgrades - Smith New Court was the latest - could only manage a 3 gain to 205p. Booker rose 11 to 480p after it surprised the market by announcing that it had sold two subsidiaries, Holland &amp; Barrett and Kingswood, to Lloyds Chemists for Pounds 55m. Analysts said the deal would reduce Booker's gearing by 20 points to 85 per cent. Mr Carl Short of Nomura increased his next year's Booker forecast by Pounds 1m to Pounds 114m, welcoming the news as 'a good deal for Booker'. Lloyds rose 3 to 278p on the announcement, but a Pounds 71.1m rights issue prevented a larger advance. Food specialists said Booker may announce a further small disposal this morning to Albert Fisher. Fisher eased a penny to 120p ahead of its interim results today. Profits of Pounds 44m against Pounds 19.9m last time are expected. First-quarter new business figures from Legal &amp; General were described as disappointing by the market and the shares, additionally unsettled by a UBS Philips &amp; Drew review of the life sector, fell 6 to 459p. Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC) added 6 at 236p in response to the publication of the prospectus for the flotation of Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN). MCC and MGN are both controlled by Mr Robert Maxwell. A newspaper report revived talk that MB-Caradon, the building products and printing group, was on the verge of selling its 25 per cent stake in CMB Packaging. Mr Richard Rae at Hoare Govett said that the talked-of price of Pounds 300m was in line with expectations and would give Caradon Pounds 100m net cash. Caradon gained 12 to 234p. Bid speculation took hold in Caird, the waste management company, and the shares rose 7 more to 72p. Severn Trent Water is a major shareholder after allowing its offer to lapse last December and must agree terms with Caird before it can return within the statutory 12 months required by Takeover Panel rules. Several main board directors of Caird announced further share purchases on Tuesday. Specialist engineer EIS Group rose to a 1991 high of 330p, up 8 1/2 , on the good results and a positive statement which outweighed the call for fresh funds of Pounds 18.3m. A sixfold increase in annual profits and an encouraging view on current trading lifted Copymore 7 to 40p. BAA added 16 to 444p following comments by Sir Norman Payne, the chairman, that airline passenger traffic is almost back to pre-Gulf war levels. A B Ports was up a penny at 267p despite late news the Monopolies and Mergers Commission is to investigate cross-Solent ferry services. A B Ports' subsidiary, Red Funnel, has a 20 per cent share in the market. USM-quoted Radio City jumped 42 to 301p, after peaking at 318p, as it revealed it was in talks that might lead to a bid. Traders suggested the buyer was unlikely to be another radio company, given that the sector's advertising revenue has been hard hit by the recession. Two quoted holiday tour operators continued to be squeezed higher in response to reports of record levels of bookings. Airtours rose 14 to 402p and Owners Abroad firmed 6 to 92p. Ivory &amp; Sime, the Edinburgh-based fund management group, bounced 8 to 123p as investors scented increased business from the acquisition of fellow fund group Argosy Asset Management. The latter had been facing uncertainty since it lost management of the Merchant Navy Officers' Pension Fund last month. Support of investment trust Berry Starquest also increased. Dealers became wary, having seen buying recently from brokers not normally associated with investment in the sector, and speculation arose of Berry perhaps reporting some other development with the annual results, due tomorrow. The shares rose 5 to 141p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991 NEW HIGHS (195).

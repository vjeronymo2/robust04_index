			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Election 92: Clarke's anger at '1960s peers' MR KENNETH CLARKE, the education secretary, yesterday blamed a 'farcical performance' by Labour and Liberal Democrat peers for the deletion of central provisions in the Education (Schools) Bill, Ivor Owen writes. He claimed that a 'collection of 1960s peers' had been responsible for defeating the government and inserting an amendment designed to limit the choice school governors can exercise in deciding how their establishments should be inspected. The amendment, which at the time of the defeat was said by Baroness Blatch, a junior minister, to have 'torn the heart out of the bill', ensures that a centralised inspection system is retained. Mr Clarke's caustic comments about the peers reflected his frustration in having to accept the defeat inflicted by the Lords or lose the entire bill because of the the current parliamentary session being curtailed by the general election.</p>

			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MOSCOW BIG ON BIG MAC, EVEN AT $12  </P> <P> Muscovites say they will go on eating Big Macs, even at double the price.  </P> <P> "Of course the food is very expensive for us, but where else can we get a  hamburger that tastes like this?" asked Elena Dachenko, as she munched a  cheeseburger today.  </P> <P> "This restaurant has so much culture," said Katya Zavapovskaya. "I'll probably  continue eating here even though the prices are higher."  </P> <P> McDonald's doubled its prices Monday, making the capital's first American-style  fast-food restaurant unaffordable for many.  </P> <P> But most customers lining up to enter McDonald's today in a steady drizzle  appeared unaware of the increases, announced in the newspaper Izvestia.  </P> <P> A Big Mac hamburger has soared to about $12 at the official exchange rate. A  double cheeseburger now costs $9.60.  </P> <P> Marc Winer, general director of McDonald's in Moscow, said the restaurant was  forced to raise prices to compensate for increased costs of meat and vegetable  oil. "It was a painful decision," he said.  </P> <P> Since the Pushkin Square restaurant opened in January, it has served about  50,000 customers a day.  </P></p>

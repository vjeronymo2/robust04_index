			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Faster growth sought at Heathrow BAA, the airports operator, yesterday warned that London's Heathrow airport risked losing out to its main European competitors including Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam, unless a proposed Pounds 900m fifth terminal was built earlier than planned. Sir John Egan, BAA's chief executive, said he hoped the terminal would be completed about six months early to avoid a capacity crunch. Although the new terminal is not due to be completed until late 2001, Sir John said the pace of passenger growth at Heathrow could start outstripping current terminal capacity by 1998. Passenger volumes at Heathrow have grown 8 per cent to 45.5m during the past 12 months. Sir John said there might be more congestion unless the new terminal was built ahead of schedule. 'The inevitable result will be that many airlines and passengers will choose to fly not to or through London, but to our European competitors,' he warned. BAA would like to see the public inquiry into the building of the new terminal brought forward. This is expected to start at the end of next year. Sir John also announced plans for a new Pounds 20m flight-connection centre at Heathrow designed to make it easier for passengers to change aircraft and terminals by providing smooth connections between flights and streamlined check-in, security and immigration. The centre will be built between Terminals 1 and 2 and will include a range of shopping and eating facilities as well as a fitness centre, beauty clinic, business facilities and a video games centre. The Pounds 20m facility is expected to open in October 1994. BAA Results, Page 19</p>

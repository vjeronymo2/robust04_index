			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT;  </P> <P> TEACHERS PROTEST STALLED NEGOTIATIONS  </P> <P> About 60 teachers picketed in front of Dana Hills High School on Monday to  protest stalled contract negotiations with the Capistrano Unified School  District.  </P> <P> The teachers protested for almost an hour in front of the school before ending  the demonstration in time to begin 8 a.m. classes.  </P> <P> The school district and the teachers union are at an impasse concerning  salaries and health care benefits.  </P> <P> The teachers, who have worked without a contract since last July, are seeking  an 8.5% pay increase, said Ric Stephenson, president of the Capistrano Unified  Educators Assn. The district has offered a 6% increase, he said.  </P> <P> The union also objects to district proposals for cuts in health care benefits,  Stephenson said.  </P> <P> The two sides are scheduled for a mediation hearing Feb. 13 and 14.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a mediator helped the district's classified employee union reach a  contract agreement with the administration last week.  </P> <P> The classified union, which includes secretaries, bus drivers and maintenance  workers, will receive a 7.5% cost-of-living raise retroactive to the expiration  of its contract in July.  </P> <P> Stephenson said he hopes that mediation will help. "We would love for that to  happen," he said. FRANK MESSINA  </P></p>

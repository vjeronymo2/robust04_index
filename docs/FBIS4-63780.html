			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 23/5/1994 -- "We are aware that  the responsibility for a successful implementation of economic  reforms was assumed by the top leadership and first of all by  the head of state which accepted us as co-authors of the reform  program," declared today at a meeting with President Snegur the  vice-president of the World Bank (WB), Welfred Thaiwitz, reports  a presidential press service communique. The WB will continue  to support financially reforms in Moldova. The WB experts say  that some progress has already been registered: stability of  national currency and decrease in the inflation rates.  President Snegur welcomed the WB's idea of opening a permanent  mission in Moldova and expressed his hope that the latter,  together with the IMF, will contribute to economic recovery.  Snegur mentioned two aspects of major importance for a  successful implementation of reforms -- political stability and  rapid privatization of state property. It was specified that  the Ministry of Privatization, which was recently created, was  meant to serve as a catalyst for the process, to make it  consistent and irreversible, says the press communique.</p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Shoppers delay Christmas spree CONSUMERS APPEAR to be saving their Christmas shopping for the days immediately before the holiday, a survey from the Confederation of British Industry indicated yesterday. The CBI's latest distributive trades survey, published yesterday, pointed to a fall in retail sales volumes in November compared with the previous year. However, a significant divergence emerged between large and small retailers. While a majority of bigger retailers said business increased compared with November 1991, a majority of smaller shops reported a decline. Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, said the wet weather in November 'probably acted as a dampener on discretionary sales'. Sales volumes for grocers, chemists, footwear and leather, furniture and carpet stores were higher than in November last year. But durable household goods, clothing, hardware, china and do-it-yourself stores, along with off-licences, booksellers and stationers reported that business was down on an annual basis. 'November continued to reveal mixed fortunes for retailers,' Mr Nigel Whittaker said. He said retailers expected business volumes to be virtually unchanged this month from last year's levels. It was very difficult to predict the Christmas trade, though. 'Every year people leave their Christmas shopping later and later,' he said. 'There is everything to go for.' The CBI's latest survey of companies in the retail, wholesale and motor trades indicates that there will be further job losses and investment cuts in the distributive trades over the next three months. On the other hand, the outlook is favourable for consumers, with retailers reporting annual price increases that are among the lowest since the CBI survey began in 1983. Recent CBI surveys have been less optimistic about retail sales than government figures, which have shown a modest underlying increase. Mr Whittaker said yesterday that discrepancy, with weak consumer confidence figures, justified caution about the outlook for consumer spending. 'However, with bank base rates at 7 per cent, the conditions appear to be in place for a modest upturn in consumer demand in the new year,' he said. The CBI survey showed that retailers hesitated to place orders with their suppliers. Across the distributive trades as a whole, import penetration fell because of a reduction of buying abroad by the wholesale and motor trades. By contrast, retailers' deliveries covered by imports rose slightly compared with a year ago. Mr Whittaker said: 'Investment plans among retailers, wholesalers and motor traders continue to deteriorate as business confidence weakens further. The sharp job losses reported and expected across the distributive trades reflect companies' determination to cut costs.' The survey was conducted between November 17 and December 2. The 483 respondents cover 15,000 outlets in retailing, wholesaling and the motor trades.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                       RETAIL SECTOR PERFORMANCE  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Per cent balances             Nov   Dec   Jan   Feb   Mar   Apr   May  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Retail total                    6    -7    13     9    16    18    22 Grocers                        67    43    46    30    38    60    48 Specialist food                23    -6   -38   -52    16   -30   -15 Off licence                   -26   -34   -59     0   -12   -13    -8 Clothing                       47    -9    56    54   -24    -2    21 Footwear and leather          -15   -44    77    48   -93    -4    33 Durable household goods        -5   -23    10    -6   -26    26   -33 Furniture and carpets          15    56    -7    53     4    70   -33 Hardware, china &amp; DIY         -20   -13    -7     6   -22    -5    36 Confectionery                  36   -15   -15    58     9    82     4 Booksellers &amp; stationers      -32   -48     6    19   -27   -28   -28 Chemists                       37    26     4    28    18    66    66 Other retail                  -24   -24    38    23   -45    12    12 Motor trades                  -50   -47   -42   -48   -43    -8    -8  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Per cent balances             Jun   Jul   Aug   Sep   Oct   Nov  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Retail total                   12   -18   -24     7   -18   -18 Grocers                        10     3     0    31    19     2 Specialist food               -62   -54   -65   -50   -28   -24 Off licence                    10    -3   -88  -100   -56   -47 Clothing                        8   -25   -27    42    -8   -18 Footwear and leather            1   -30    68    39   -49    11 Durable household goods       -50   -10    -2   -11    -1   -10 Furniture and carpets          -2   -43    33    48   -12    15 Hardware, china &amp; DIY         -10   -28   -22   -52    11   -38 Confectionery                  39    26   -57    37     4     0 Booksellers &amp; stationers      -61    -9   -18    -1   -39   -53 Chemists                       62    36    20   -28    58    79 Other retail                   30    13    -5     5   -23   -44 Motor trades                  -17   -44    15   -33   -30   -31  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: CBI Distributive Trades Sruvey  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Figures are balances; the numbers of traders reporting sales increases on a year ago, less thos reporting decreases  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Blanche Petrich] </F>   [Text] Deputy Foreign Relations Secretary Andres Rozental  has said here that the initiative of Senators Robert Torricelli  and David Bonior, who oppose NAFTA, presented yesterday to the  U.S. Congress in Washington to ensure that U.S. demands that  Mexico accept the presence of foreign observers during the  August election, is "unnecessary, rather unserious, and  disqualifying in essence."    As he commented on the U.S. congressmen's proposals, the  Mexican diplomat stressed the position already taken by the  Mexican Embassy in Washington. "The nature of the Mexican  electoral process is something that concerns neither the U.S.  Congress nor the U.S. Government."    As for the concept of "foreign visitors" which the Mexican  Congress already included in the Federal Code of Institutions  and Electoral Procedures (Cofipe), Rozental pointed out that the  government "so far" has not anticipated inviting any foreign  figure or institution to witness the development of the general  elections. "Should there be an agreement on this issue among  the nine political parties, I am sure the government would not  oppose it."    He also explained that the procedures to extend the  invitations will "not necessarily" be accomplished through the  Foreign Relations Secretariat. "In that case, the Federal  Electoral Institute [IFE] and Government Secretary Jorge  Carpizo, as IFE president [as published], must extend the  invitations."    According to a document by the UN Electoral Assistance Unit,  headed by Horacio Boneo, the Mexican Government is reportedly  studying the possibility of authorizing "foreign visitors" who,  it is believed, would join the group of almost 15,000 national  observers who will verify compliance with the laws at the 94,000  electoral booths that will open nationwide on 21 August.    Last week, these observers, members of a large network of  nongovernmental organizations grouped under the Observation 94  Civic Alliance, agreed with the United Nations to set up a  mechanism to receive training and counsel from the UN Electoral  Assistance Unit.    Meanwhile, the process to reform Cofipe to allow the  presence  of "foreign visitors" ended on 13 May, as the Congress  unanimously approved the inclusion of this new concept in  Mexican legislation. The only thing left to do is to include the  definition, responsibilities, and limitations of these  "visitors" in the regulating law.    So far, only the Confederation of Industrial Chambers has  planned to invite some foreign institutions, including the  commission headed by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, as  "visitors." It is expected political parties will hand out  their own invitations to similar institutions and personalities.    The Bonior-Torricelli initiative, which is based on the  concept that NAFTA must foster a spirit of "familiarity" among  its three members in all fields, including politics and  democracy, failed to receive the endorsement to be presented to  the U.S. House of Representatives. It seems only 14  representatives are supporting it, and the Foreign Affairs  Committee is refusing to back it.    "I have the impression that in addition to a few  Mexico-bashers [previous word published in English] there, no  further support is going to be found; Bonior and Torricelli will  achieve nothing." The deputy secretary stressed that the  wording of the initiative by these two Democratic congressmen  has "meddling undertones," and it is completely fruitless.    "The U.S. Government, even Bill Clinton himself, has  supported all efforts made so far to improve the electoral  process and, above all, the foreign observation issue, which we  are resolving on our own [motu propio]. This  Torricelli play does not even help."    The duo had previously presented several initiatives on  Mexico. The two of them were very active in opposing NAFTA  because they thought Mexico lacked the merits to become a  privileged member of the northern hemisphere. Recently, they  attempted to encourage Congress to discuss the Chiapas conflict.    "I feel Torricelli, with his Cuban perceptions on his back,  is very resentful because he failed to convince our government  to support his anti-Cuban policies," said the deputy secretary.  As for Bonior, "this is his revenge for failing to halt NAFTA."  The thing "is that neither of them knows Mexico, and it shows."</p>

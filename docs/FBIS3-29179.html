He added that in 1992, Petrovietnam struck production  sharing  contracts with foreign companies to explore and exploit oil and  gas in the northern continental shelf and in the onshore basin  of the northern Red River delta. In addition a number of other  deals have been signed for the exploration and exploitation of  oil and gas from oilfields on the southern continental shelf.  As a result of this progress, oil and gas production in Vietnam  may exceed 20 million tonnes a year by 2000. Petrovietnam in  1994 expects to tap 7.1 million tonnes of crude oil, up 800,000  tonnes over last year's level. This would include the first  amount of 0.3 million tonnes pumped from the Rong (Dragon) and  Dai Hung (Big Bear) Oilfields. The oil and gas industry has good  prospect in the coming years as the operation and development in  Dai Hung and Thanh Long (Blue Dragon) nearby Dai Hung Oilfields  come into production. By then Vietnam would rank one of the  world's biggest oil producers. According to foreign  entrepreneurs, a well of the Dai Hung Oilfield which was  successfully drilled recently could be put into operation in the  third quarter of this year. It is expected that more than 1,000  tonnes of crude oil could be tapped per day from this well.  Petrovietnam also actively carries out a project to gas from  Bach Ho into the mainland in 1994 for electricity generation,  chemical fertilizers manufacture and other products processed  from crude oil for export. The country's first oil refinery has  been under construction since 1993 with a view of introducing  its products refined from crude oil and the natural gas to the  domestic market before 2000. To this end another project for  building of the second oil refinery was carried out last month.</p>

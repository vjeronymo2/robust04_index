			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL OKS VOTE ON BILTMORE SITE  </P> <P> An initiative to retain the Biltmore site in Hermosa Beach as open space will  be placed on the November ballot, the City Council decided unanimously Tuesday  night. The measure, circulated by Parker Herriott, qualified for the ballot  last month, but could have been adopted by the council as an ordinance.  </P> <P> O That course was unlikely in view of the council majority's support for a  compromise proposal suggested by a citizens advisory committee in late March.  It called for using about 65% of the 0.84-acre city-owned parcel as an "urban  public plaza" and selling the rest to developers.  </P> <P> City Atty. James P. Lough noted some legal flaws in Herriott's initiative, but  said it was sufficiently valid to qualify. He said the council could not  legally make any changes before exercising its options to adopt the measure as  an ordinance or to place it on the ballot.  </P></p>

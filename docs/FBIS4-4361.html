			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tan Duc] </F>   [Text] In 1993, another 92 units with foreign investment  capital and 1,425 private enterprises were established in Ho Chi  Minh City, bringing the total number of joint enterprise and  investment units to 288 and the total number of private  enterprises to 2,208. The rate of increase in the number of new  enterprises in these two spheres is almost double that of 1992.  If the 288 joint enterprises and 2,208 private enterprises carry  on operations simultaneously, they will certainly consume a huge  amount of electricity. If Ho Chi Minh City's electricity  distribution network can't satisfy the needs, everyone knows  what will happen.    According to data disclosed by the Ho Chi Minh City Electric  Power Service, the carrier capacity of the city's existing power  net is approximately 420 megawatts, which is about 80 megawatts  below consumption needs. Thus, there is already an imbalance  between needs and carrier capacity. This is one of the things  that has led to a drop in pressure and unexpected power outages,  which has caused large losses for many production, business, and  service installations. The Ho Chi Minh City Electric Power  Service has calculated that electricity consumption in the city  will increase to 600 and 700 megawatts by the end of 1994 and  1995 respectively. Because of this, unless immediate action is  taken, Ho Chi Minh CIty will find itself in a situation in which  it "doesn't know whether to laugh or cry." Because on one hand,  the supply of electricity will have increased greatly, but on  the other hand, electricity needs will have increased but the  carrier capacity of the distribution network will not have the  capabilities to satisfy those needs. Managers are aware of this,  but it is beyond their power to do anything about it.  Fortunately, since 1993, financial capabilities have allowed Ho  Chi Minh City to begin implementing plans to make improvements  on a large scale. On 31 March 1993, the Ministry of Energy  finished examining the economic and technical arguments  concerning the project to improve and expand the municipal  electric power network, 1992-1995 phase. At the beginning of  September 1993, the city decided to spend 151 billion dong to  implement eight projects in the plan to improve and upgrade  things in order to increase the carrier capacity of the electric  power network to 700 megawatts. The project got underway during  the 4th quarter of 1993 and will be completed by the end of 1994.    Tran Minh Quy, the man in charge of implementing the  electric  power network improvement project of the Ho Chi Minh CIty  Electric Power Service, said that this is a major improvement  project. The electric power sector is urgently implementing  this. The things that must be done include:    Building thirty 15-kv lines from the intermediary stations,  which includes 4.7 km of underground cable and 61.5 km of  above-ground landlines.    Improving and upgrading 195 km of 15-kv landlines and laying  another 40 km of new landlines.    Upgrading the low voltage from 100 volts to 220 volts for  600  zones.    Replacing 60 breakers and installing 91 controllers and 70  relays in order to improve eleven 15-kv breaker stations.    Besides this, in order to improve electricity safety among  the people, the electricity sector will install an additional  5.9 km of 15-kv landlines and 48 km of low-voltage landlines,  improve the other 55 km of low-voltage landlines, and build 62  low-voltage, 9,885 kva, stations. As part of the project to  improve the electricity network, electrification will be carried  out in six villages in six rural districts: Xuan Thoi Thuong in  Hoc Mon District, Long Hoa in Can Gio District, Phuoc Kien in  Nha Be District, Trung An in Cu Chi District, Binh Hung Hoa in  Binh Chanh District, and Long Truong in Thu Duc District. In the  villages in Xuan Thoi Thuong and Long Truong districts,  construction got underway at the end of 1993.    As mentioned above, once the improvement project has been  completed, the capacity of the Ho Chi Minh City electricity  network will increase from 420 mw to 700 mw. But according to  Tran Minh Quy, with just 151 billion dong, only one of the five  problems now facing the city's electricity network can be  solved, that is, the problem concerning carrier and distribution  capabilities to satisfy electricity consumption needs and  receive power from the new sources of generation. Only minor  improvements will be made with respect to the other problems,  that is, the quality of the electric power supplied, the  confidence in the power supply, safety in electricity supply and  use, and losses. In order to solve the above problems and ensure  that consumption needs, which will reach 1,300 mw by the year  2000, are satisfied, the electricity sector has about 10 more  projects that must be built, which will require investment  capital of more than 2.4 trillion dong. The work to be done in  1995 will cost 470 billion dong.    The year 2000 is fast approaching, and the requirements  imposed on the electricity sector are rather great. Obtaining  capital to implement the plans is still a difficult problem. At  present, the electricity sector is looking only at supplemental  power funds and a small sum allocated from the municipal budget.  Recently, representatives from the World Bank came to Ho Chi  Minh City to survey things and study the capabilities for  financing the projects to improve the municipal electricity  network as part of the general financial program for the  Vietnamese energy sector. In December 1993, World Bank  representatives returned and issued a notice that the World Bank  will send specialists to study the plans for improving and  expanding the electricity network at a total cost of $44  million, of which the World Bank will finance $33 million. The  draft study phase will conclude in 1994, and preparations for  actually implementing things will get underway in 1995. With  this financial aid, when added to the efforts of the locality,  it is hoped that by the year 2000 Ho Chi Minh City will have the  desired electricity carrier and distribution network.

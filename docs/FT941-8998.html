			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / World Trade News: US poised to take lead in digital HDTV The US is set to take world leadership in digital high-definition television (HDTV) following the announcement yesterday of a final decision on establishing technical standards for the new generation of TV technology. HDTV is expected to provide crisper television pictures. It will, however, require consumers to buy new television sets. The US 'Digital HDTV Grand Alliance' - a group of companies that have been developing HDTV technology for the US market - said that it had made its final major technical decision by selecting technology from Zenith for digital transmission of HDTV signals via terrestrial broadcast or cable systems. The announcement marks the end of months of testing of various aspects of HDTV technology by the Grand Alliance together with the Federal Communications Commission. The Digital HDTV standard represents the merging of technologies from the three groups that had developed digital HDTV systems for consideration as the US standard. The parties involved are: AT&amp;T and Zenith Electronics, General Instrument and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and a consortium composed of Thomson Consumer Electronics, Philips Consumer Electronics and the David Sarnoff Research Center. The companies agreed to co-operate last May, at the urging of the FCC, which asked the rival industry groups to combine the best features of each of their HDTV technology to create a 'best of the best' standard. The complete Grand Alliance HDTV system is now scheduled for final verification testing in late 1994 and field testing in early 1995. The US digital HDTV system, unlike Japan's analogue system, is compatible with computers and digital telecommunications technologies as well as television. It is therefore expected to play a central role in the establishment of the National Information Infrastructure (NII), known as the 'information superhighway'.</p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Birkdale disposal eliminates debt Birkdale Group, the lossmaking advertising, public relations and marketing company, has sold the Macmillan Davies Group and its subsidiaries for Pounds 1.61m cash. The consideration, which includes the repayment of inter-company debt, will be adjusted according to the net liabilities of Macmillan Davies on the completion date. The disposal will result in a profit of about Pounds 250,000, which will be used to eliminate outstanding borrowings. Birkdale raised some Pounds 4.7m last year via two rights issues to finance the acquisition of MK Design-In-Store. It also sold its Lewis Broadbent advertising agency for Pounds 127,000. In the six months to end-September 1993 the group incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.47m on turnover of Pounds 10.4m.</p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPROMISE SUGGESTED FOR LONG BEACH FREEWAY  </P> <P> Regarding Mr. (Arthur) Flemming's letter published Oct. 19, I am in agreement  with the extension of the 710 freeway beyond its current terminus and assume  that it was not originally extended due to the uncertainty of the route  (through or around South Pasadena). Mr. Flemming raises a point which should be  given adequate consideration.  </P> <P> The residents of South Pasadena, or at least a very vocal percentage, have  lobbied to keep the freeway from bisecting their community. Although only  300-plus people were present for the anti-710 march, out of a city whose  population is approximately 24,000, I believe the community's sentiment is that  they would prefer no freeway to any alternative route.  </P> <P> If this is indeed the case, the freeway should be extended to a reasonable  terminus in an effort to relieve the congestion on many of Alhambra's surface  streets as well as those of neighboring communities. In Pasadena that point  seems to have been reached, California Boulevard. I assume very few residents  of that neighborhood would argue for extension to Columbia Street, roughly  three-fourths of a mile further south, on the northern border of South  Pasadena. For Alhambra the situation is somewhat different.  </P> <P> If the freeway was extended from its Valley Boulevard terminus, currently  within the city of Alhambra, it would run through the East Los Angeles  community of El Sereno, on the western border of Alhambra. It could be extended  as far north as Kendall Avenue, on the southern border of South Pasadena, or  more legitimately to Huntington Drive, a six-lane divided thoroughfare that can  be traveled safely at 40 m.p.h.  </P> <P> Huntington Drive is nearly 1 1/4 miles further north than the freeway's current  northern terminus and, I assume, could adequately accommodate the additional  traffic with moderate planning and preparation. This would allow residents of  Arcadia, San Marino, Pasadena and South Pasadena a route to bypass surface  streets in Alhambra, San Gabriel, Rosemead and El Monte. The "thru" traffic  would proceed north as it does currently, along Fremont Avenue or Fair Oaks  Avenue, to the 710/210/134 on-ramps.  </P> <P> I am sure there are many other issues to be addressed regarding this proposal,  and I certainly don't expect the residents of El Sereno to adopt it without  skepticism. But, as a compromise to the residents and commuters in the  aforementioned communities, I believe it should be given consideration.  </P> <P> STEVE SHELBURNE  </P> <P> Alhambra  </P></p>

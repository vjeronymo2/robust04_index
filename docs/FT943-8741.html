			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Compromise hopes for US crime bill: White House may make concessions to opponents on social spending plans Democrats and Republicans edged towards a compromise yesterday that could bring President Bill Clinton's crime bill back before Congress, perhaps as early as this week. On the surface, neither side was running away from the fight, and Mr Clinton was particularly scathing in his attacks on the Republican leadership. 'No more excuses, no more tricks, no more delays and no more discussion,' he said at a White House ceremony, flanked by angry relatives of crime victims who were equally damning in their criticism of the Republicans and the gun lobby. But both sides appeared ready to make concessions that could bring the crime bill -blocked last week on a procedural vote that dealt a severe rebuff to Mr Clinton - back to the floor of the House of Representatives for another vote. Mr Leon Panetta, the White House chief of staff, said yesterday the president would not back away from some of the bill's central elements: the provision of an extra 100,000 police officers, the 'three strikes and out' rule imposing mandatory life sentences for a third violent crime, and particularly the ban on assault guns. But Mr Panetta said the White House might be willing to reduce some of the spending included in the bill to finance crime prevention programmes. Republican critics of the bill have focused on money to fund midnight basketball leagues, designed to provide alternative activities for city youths who might otherwise be roaming the streets in gangs, as a symbol of what they see as wasteful social spending. Mr Clinton insists that this kind of programme - which is supported by many police and law enforcement associations - is important to give young Americans 'something to say yes to'. But White House officials and the Democratic leadership in Congress appeared ready to give ground on some of the programmes. 'If we have to pay the price to take out some good programmes to satisfy the critics, I'm not opposed to doing that,' said Mr Thomas Foley, the Speaker of the House. Mr Newt Gingrich, the Republican whip in the House, continued to urge yesterday that the ban on assault guns should be stripped out of the crime bill and proposed in a separate bill. But he said he would be willing to allow the bill to go forward in return for changes such as a tougher requirement that communities be notified when convicted sex offenders who have been released from prison come to live there. No such spirit of compromise was to be seen in the Senate, where Mr Clinton's other main legislative objective, the reform of the healthcare system, is now held up in endless debate. Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader, said yesterday that he was not conducting a filibuster, but he continued to prevent any votes from being taken. This may prove to be a political risk, however, in the light of public opinion polls showing widespread disapproval of any filibuster on healthcare reform.</p>

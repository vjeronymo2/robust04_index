			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 19 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui  Thursday [19 May] urged mainland Chinese authorities to face the  reality of China's division with new concepts and new strategies.    President Li made the call in his national affairs address  to  the National Assembly which is meeting on Yangmingshan in  suburban Taipei to discuss sweeping constitutional reforms.    Li said Beijing's resistance to recognizing China's division  into two separate parts has hindered the establishment of mutual  trust between the two sides of the Taiwan strait, adding he  hopes the mainland leadership will abandon its aggressive  attitude toward Taiwan and take the initiative to promote  peaceful competition between the two sides for the well-being of  the Chinese people.    He continued that defending the security of Taiwan, Penghu,  Kinmen and Matsu is now the top goal of the Republic of China  [ROC]'s national defense policy.    "We are seeking to beef up our defense capabilities by  purchasing advanced arms and enhancing combat preparedness while  trimming redundant military personnel," he explained.    The ROC is also seeking to join as many international  organizations as possible, the president noted. With the end of  the Cold War, Li said, a new world order is taking shape.    "Representation in major world organizations would enable US  to participate in discussions and formulation of new  international regulations," he noted.    The ROC will continue to promote trade with its major  trading  partners, such as the United States, Japan and European  countries, Li said. In addition, the ROC will strengthen  economic cooperation with Southeast Asian nations as part of its  efforts to help boost Asia-Pacific regional economic integration.    Li pointed out that the Republic of China has created in the  Taiwan area a multi-party democratic system which has never  existed in Chinese history. "We should not be complacent with  our current achievements, but should strive even harder for  continued national development," he noted.    Li said the government is determined to promote further  economic and political reforms, foster a cultural renaissance  and improve welfare services.    The president said all National Assembly members are welcome  to present their opinions on constitutional reforms and national  affairs. He promised to attend the assembly sessions for the  next five days to hear their opinions and reply to their  questions.    This is the first time for an ROC president to participate  in  the National Assembly national affairs discussions in their  entirety. In the past, the president was present only on the  first day of such sessions, with the secretary-general of the  presidential office then attending the remaining sessions on the  president's behalf.    During its current special three-month session, the National  Assembly is expected to pass a package of amendments to the ROC  constitution to lay a framework for further democratic reforms,  including direct popular election of the country's president and  vice president.</p>

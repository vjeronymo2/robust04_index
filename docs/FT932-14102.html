			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / UK Company News: Five Oaks hit by Pounds 1m provision AFTER providing a further Pounds 1m against write-downs in investment and development properties, Five Oaks Investment saw its pre-tax losses increase from Pounds 371,000 to Pounds 953,000 in the six months ended December 31 1992. Although the company felt the property market was bottoming out it was thought prudent to provide for a further write-down, explained Mr Trevor Robinson, chairman. On a brighter note, he said rental income now exceeded all interest and other outgoings; in the half year the surplus, with other income, was Pounds 50,000 against a deficit of Pounds 578,000. Apart from rising rents and diminishing voids, the improved performance reflected lower borrowings following the sale of the Hanley property and strict control of overheads. Losses per share came to 2.04p (0.8p).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 21 Apr (PL) -- Today, Cubans living on and  off the island agreed here in saying that their country's main  problem does not reside in differences among the Cubans but in  the hostility the United States has continually demonstrated  toward Cuba.    This coinciding opinion was reported by Havana City  historian  Eusebio Leal when he spoke at a public ceremony in Havana's Cayo  Hueso neighborhood where a plaque honoring Cuban emigrants who  promoted the reencounter with the fatherland was unveiled.    This activity, a preamble to "The Nation and the Emigrants"  conference convoked by the Cuban Foreign Ministry for 22-24  April, was presided over by Jose Ramon Balaguer, member of the  Politburo of the Communist Party of Cuba, Havana City Mayor  Pedro Chavez, and other prominent government officials.    Scores of Cubans who live in several countries and who were  invited to the forum that will begin tomorrow in Havana's  Conventions Palace attended the ceremony alongside local  residents.    Leal, who is also a parliamentary deputy, said: "Let us not  be confused or forget what is essential: The main issue is not  among Cubans. The main issue, and we must realize this, is the  ongoing, stubborn, and tenacious position the great North  American nation maintains toward Cuba's right to exist and to  prevail."    The Cuban emigrants on several occasions shouted slogans  condemning the ongoing economic blockade imposed by Washington  on the island more than three decades ago.    The plaque, placed in the popular Trillo Park, is in  remembrance of emigrants Carlos Muniz Varela (1953-79), Eulalio  Jose Negrin (1941-79), Lourdes Casals Valdes (1938-81),  Margarita Lejarza Vazquez (1950-85), Mauricio Miguel Gaston  Roche (1947-86), Manuel Antonio de Dios Unanue (1943-92), and  Eusebio Valdes Muno (1916-94).    The memorial, Leal said, focuses on various outstanding  efforts and events that are part of a yet-to-be-written Cuban  history, a history in which the Cubans in and out of Cuba, the  ones who live and those who are absent, are participants.    He recalled the talks that began between the emigrants and  the government in 1978 and noted that if the conference  signifies "the right of Cubans to understand one another, to  correspond with one another, to visit the tombs of their dead,  to go anywhere in the world, and to exchange the common treasure  of the same culture and the same language, it is welcome."    "It is very important that," he noted, "when time  accumulates so many differences, so many different viewpoints,  we have started with something very important, such as seeking a  term that will reflect the truth of the Cuban situation, so that  it will be more human, so that it will correspond more to our  history and that adequate term is emigration.    The Cayo Hueso neighborhood was founded by emigrants of the  keys, similarly named in the United States, who as a result of a  terrible fire (an epilogue to the war to which they contributed  their greatest sacrifice) which devoured their riches, were  obliged to return, the city historian recalled. That is why this  memorial has been unveiled here because it is not an uninhabited  place of Havana and is very meaningful, he said.</p>

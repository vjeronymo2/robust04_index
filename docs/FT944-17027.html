			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Iraq still to abide by UN resolutions Iraq is the subject of a long series of UN Security Council resolutions, starting with Resolutions 660 and 661, which condemned the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and imposed economic sanctions. Sanctions are to remain in place until Baghdad complies with the terms of subsequent resolutions, notably 686 and 687, passed immediately after the 1991 end of the Gulf war. Those terms include: the elimination of ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction (WMD); respect for Kuwait's borders and sovereignty; co-operation with the International Red Cross on the release of Kuwaitis and others it detained during the war, the location of missing persons; and insistence it accept its liability for the losses and damage it caused in Kuwait. In a report to the US Congress in June, President Bill Clinton reported that the US believed the International Atomic Energy Agency had 'effectively disbanded the Iraqi nuclear weapons programme, at least for the short term'. Missile launchers and 'a good deal of Iraq's indigenous capability to manufacture prohibited missiles' have been destroyed, and UN missions have reduced Iraq's ability to produce chemical weapons. But, US officials say, 'serious gaps remain in accounting for Iraq's missile and weapons of mass destruction programmes'. They regard the setting-up of a long-term monitoring programme as especially important, 'because we believe Saddam Hussein is committed to rebuilding his WMD capability'. Also, the US says, Iraq has continued to breach Resolution 688, which demands it stop persecuting its Kurdish inhabitants and other populations such as the Marsh Arabs. Baghdad continues to drain the marshes and burn the reeds in southern Iraq and to raze or shell villages. Iraq still refuses to recognise Kuwait's sovereignty and the inviolability of the UN-demarcated border between Iraq and Kuwait, which the Security Council reaffirmed in Resolutions 773 and 833. Nor has it co-operated, US officials say, with the International Red Cross on Kuwaiti detainees, or given information about 600 people listed as missing.</p>

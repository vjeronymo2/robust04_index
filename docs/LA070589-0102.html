			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW REBOUNDS FROM EARLY SLIDE, RISES 3.79  </P> <P> Wall Street stocks finished a trace higher today after the market recovered  completely from an early slide triggered by a fall in the dollar.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 3.79 points at 2,456.56.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 5 on the New York Stock  Exchange, with 879 up, 552 down and 508 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 127.70 million shares, up from 68.87 million in the  previous session.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index rose .74 to 179.25.  </P> <P> Earlier the Dow index had lost about 16 points in reaction to the dollar's fall  below 1.9 West German marks for the first time in two months.  </P> <P> But the market recovered around noon, helped in part by renewed interest in  takeover issues and some futures-related buying.  </P> <P> </P> <P> In a Wary Mood  </P> <P> Analysts said recent economic reports showing a further slowdown in business  activity over the last couple of months had put investors in a wary mood.  </P> <P> They said people who had been enthusiastically embracing hopes for a "soft  landing" now have begun to wonder whether something a bit bumpier might be in  store.  </P> <P> Confirmed optimists on Wall Street argue that the Federal Reserve will counter  any such perils by relaxing its credit policy, giving the economy a shot of  adrenaline and allowing interest rates to fall.  </P> <P> The Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's policy-setting group, is  meeting today and Thursday to consider what to do next. Evidence of its  decisions may be forthcoming soon in the credit markets.  </P> <P> A sell-off overseas and a weak dollar helped depress bond prices today, while  short-term interest rates headed lower amid continued speculation that the  Federal Reserve will ease its credit policies.  </P> <P> The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond tumbled 7/8 point, or around $8.75 per  $1,000 face amount, by midday. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price,  jumped to 8.13% from 8.06% late Monday.  </P> <P> The financial markets were closed on Tuesday in observance of the Independence  Day holiday.  </P> <P> Bond traders attributed today's downturn to the dollar's decline in foreign  exchange and to heavy selling of U.S. bonds in Japan, with some pointing to the  sale of $500 million of 30-year securities by a trust bank there.  </P> <P> Traders said the Japanese are concerned that the dollar would continue to  decline as the Fed eases short-term interest rates to prevent the U.S. economy  from falling into a recession.  </P> <P> The Federal Open Market Committee began its two-day policy-making meeting  today, and many analysts predict that the consensus there will be toward easing  credit.  </P> <P> Short-term rates plunged as a result today.  </P> <P> Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.04% as the discount plunged 16  basis points to 7.79%. Yields on six-month bills fell to 7.97% as the discount  fell 5 basis points to 7.57%. Yields on 1-year bills held at 8.02% and the  discount was unchanged at 7.47%.  </P> <P> A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the  annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the  percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at  maturity.  </P> <P> But the federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was  unchanged from Monday at 9 7/16%.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of short-term  government issues were unchanged to 1/16 point lower, intermediate maturities  fell between 1/8 point and 11/32 point and long-term issues dropped from 1/2  point to 7/8 point, according to Telerate Inc.  </P></p>

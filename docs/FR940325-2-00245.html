			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Due to the overall number of eligible tribes, and in order to maintain the minimum grant amounts at an acceptable level, the ``bonus'' incentive available to consortiums in FY 1992/FY 1993 is being discontinued. By letter of December 24, 1991, the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs notified all tribes that, in the absence of regulations authorizing a conversion to a noncompetitive ICWA process, FY 1992 was a transitional year, and that the funding mechanisms implemented in FY 1992 might be changed when revised regulations became effective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title II of the Indian Child Welfare Act, at Section 201(b), clearly encourages tribes to seek funds from other sources to enhance the quality and scope of ICWA child and family services programs. Accordingly, Indian tribes are encouraged to maximize the effectiveness of ICWA funds by designing grant activities that integrate with or complement other Federal, state, local or tribal child and family service programs that may be available to serve their communities. ICWA grant funds may also be used as non-Federal matching shares under Social Security Act or any other Federal financial assistance programs which contribute to the purpose for which funds are authorized to be appropriated for use under the Indian Child Welfare Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No ICWA grant funds will be withheld at the Central Office for appeals related to a tribe's funding level; therefore, approved applications will be funded strictly on the availability of funds and in accordance with the funding amounts published in this grant announcement. The respective Area Director has final funding authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the consultation meetings BIA held with Indian tribes on the matter of how available funds for ICWA grants should be allocated, it was determined that the allocation of funds should be made on the basis of each eligible tribe's service area population. In the table printed below, ICWA funding amounts are given for a series of service area population ranges. The individual tribal allocations of FY 1994 ICWA funds are based on estimated service area population figures that recently have been certified by each Area Director as being the most accurate population data available for tribes within his/her area's jurisdiction. Tribes may contact their area social worker to learn the amount of ICWA funds for which they are eligible to apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

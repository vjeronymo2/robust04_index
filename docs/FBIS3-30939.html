			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Zvornik, Feb 9 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslems and  Bosnian Croats on Wednesday continued their fierce fighting at  unabated intensity in southern and central parts of this  ex-Yugoslav republic, Bosnian Serb army sources said.    Their fighting was the fiercest in southern Bosnia and in  the  Mostar region, then outside Vitez, Kiseljak, Zepca and  Zavidovici.    Sources of the two sides indirectly confirm that the Moslems  were sustaining big losses in central Bosnia.    Inter-Moslem armed provocations also continued in the  Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia (APWB), as tensions were  mounting amongst local population ahead of the expiration on  Thursday of the deadline set by the fifth command of Bosnian  Moslem forces loyal to the Moslem authorities in Sarajevo. The  ultimatum wanted an unconditional surrender by the APWB forces.    The APWB signed separate peace with Bosnian Serbs and  Bosnian  Croats, striving for a peaceful solution to the three-nations  conflict in the central ex-Yugoslav republic.    Moslem forces in the past 24 hours continued provocations  and  offensive actions towards the Serb side on a number of  battlefronts. [passage omitted]</p>

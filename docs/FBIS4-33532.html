			<p>BFN     [Text] Belem do Para, 7 Jun (EFE) -- Panamanian Vice  Foreign Minister Carlos Cordero stated here today that the  Panamanian Government will not accept "the slightest change" in  the terms and timetable established in the Torrijos-Carter  treaty for the handover of the Panama Canal to Panama.    Cordero emphasized the significance of faithfully complying  with the accords signed in 1977 by Panama and the United States,  which sought to decolonize Panama. He added that the canal  "must come under absolute Panamanian domain and sovereignty."    Today, Cordero addressed the 24th OAS General Assembly,  which  opened on 6 June at the city of Belem, Para State, in the  Brazilian Amazon region. The assembly is due to close on 10  June.    Cordero noted the interest of President Guillermo Endara's  government in promoting a constitutional reform that would  guarantee a professional administration of the Panama Canal as  soon as it comes under complete Panamanian jurisdiction five  years from now.    Cordero added that a professional administration, through an  autonomous organization, would prevent the canal from being  affected by political ups and downs and will reassure its  customers around the world.    Cordero also outlined a number of international agreements  to  fight drug trafficking signed by Panama with the United States,  Great Britain, Central American countries, Colombia, and the  United Nations.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Observer: Tirana vacancy If Giuliano Amato, who last week submitted his resignation, is looking for another job, he might consider the one he turned down in order to become Italy's prime minister: negotiating the restructuring of Albania's Dollars 500m foreign debt. Now more than a year later, and despite pressure from the World Bank, the Albanian government has still not got round to appointing a negotiator. After Amato bowed out, the post was offered to an international financier few had heard of, Nicolas Arsidi. It would seem that although Arsidi was paid a Dollars 1.6m fee up front, the negotiations never got off the ground. Arsidi is now in prison in France, facing fraud charges. Albania's foreign debt was racked up during the period of political turmoil which marked the transition to democracy after 45 years of Stalinist self-sufficiency. Amid the confusion, nobody spotted what was going on at the state bank. A large chunk of debt was run up almost overnight. Making the most of their new screen-based dealing room, Albania's central bankers managed to lose Dollars 200m on international currency markets in a burst of speculation early in 1991.</p>

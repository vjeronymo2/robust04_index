			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Letter: Reforms essential if break-up of power duopoly to be avoided Sir, We welcome your support for a Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation into the electricity industry in your leading article, 'Competition in the electricity industry' (January 20). The recent critical report by Offer following its investigation into prices in the pool emphasised their 'artificiality' and confirmed that 'the dominant market position of the two major generators gives them the ability to influence and control pool prices'. Although most consumers are on contracts, these are related to pool prices. Contract price increases now having to be renegotiated indicate unacceptable and unjustified rises, damaging to industrial consumers. The regulator must now enforce changes in the price regulation formulae for use of system charges. The pool rules for capacity payments must be reviewed. Price discrimination which prevents large users from negotiating appropriate prices to reflect large regular demand must be removed. Economic justification for plant closures by the duopoly should be tested in the market, by offering them for sale at site value to other interested operators. Offer must be granted explicit powers to take action within the pool, to regulate uncompetitive bidding behaviour by generators. Unless these reforms and tougher regulation produce a more competitive market, a recommendation by the MMC for a break-up of the duopoly becomes inevitable. Peter Rost, chairman, Major Energy Users' Council, House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA</p>

			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / International Company News: Bell Atlantic to sell TriCon for Dollars 350m Bell Atlantic, the US regional telephone group, plans to spin off its TriCon Capital financial services subsidiary in a stock market flotation that could raise as much as Dollars 350m. The move is part a new strategy by Bell Atlantic to withdraw from financial services and concentrate on its core telecommunications business, which includes the cable television interests recently acquired in a Dollars 22bn takeover of Tele-Communications Inc. Two months ago Bell Atlantic said it wanted to sell off its financial services divisions. Mr William Albertini, chief financial officer, then said the group would focus its financial resources on its core operations, adding that favourable conditions in the public and private markets meant the time was right to sell its financial services businesses. TriCon Capital, based in New Jersey, provides commercial finance and equipment leasing services, and is an arm of Bell Atlantic Investments. Bell Atlantic's other financial services businesses include diversified leasing, computer leasing and real estate companies. A total of 13.5m shares in TriCon will be sold in the initial public offering, which will be underwritten by the Wall Street investment banks Lehman Brothers and Salomon Brothers; 10.8m will be sold in the US, and the remainder internationally.</p>

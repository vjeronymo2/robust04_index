			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> ANTI-PESTICIDE MEASURES COMPETE  </P> <P> Backers of a sweeping environmental protection initiative that includes strong  safeguards against pesticides in food charged that key sections of a rival  initiative, advanced by farmers and food producers, were actually proposed by  pesticide manufacturers. State Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, Assemblyman Tom  Hayden (D-Santa Monica) and the Natural Resources Defense Council charged that  the rival "wholesome food" initiative contains far weaker protections against  pesticide poisoning in foods than their proposed "Environmental Protection Act  of 1990."  </P> <P> When farmers and others announced their "wholesome food" measure last month  they said the chemical industry was not a part of their coalition. But, Van de  Kamp and Hayden said they have obtained internal campaign documents that  indicate that the agricultural chemical industry is heavily involved. The  charges were denied by the Western Agricultural Chemicals Assn. and two  campaign consulting firms involved in the issue. Both initiatives are proposed  for next November's ballot.  </P></p>

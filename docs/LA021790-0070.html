			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd, who signed with Montreal this winter after eight years  with Boston, accused Boston Manager Joe Morgan and some of his former Red Sox  teammates of racist attitudes.  </P> <P> "All I wanted was for Morgan to treat me with respect. Morgan was bad for me. .  . . He felt blacks couldn't pitch. He felt they couldn't think out there on the  mound."  </P> <P> Morgan denied the allegations.  </P> <P> "I have no idea where he's coming from and I don't really care to comment on  it," Morgan said. "I'm not upset because it's not true, but I'm not too happy,  either."  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> TOBACCO INDUSTRY FIGHTS BACK  </P> <P> The tobacco industry, in newspaper ads running around the country today, touted  a survey indicating that three of four Americans don't support workplace or  restaurant smoking bans.  </P> <P> The industry's counter-initiative through its lobbying organization, the  Tobacco Institute, comes during the week marking the 25th anniversary of the  first of the surgeon general's reports to declare smoking a health hazard.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for the institute, Brennan Dawson, noted that some anti-smoking  groups are pushing for a "smoke-free" society. "To achieve their purposes," she  said, "anti-smokers are turning to censorship, harassment, punitive taxes and  intrusion into personal and private decision-making."  </P> <P> "The majority of Americans, according to objective polling, do not support  these anti-smoking efforts," she said.  </P> <P> The institute's poll was conducted by the Washington firm of Hamilton,  Frederick &amp; Schneiders, which said it randomly telephoned 1,500 Americans  over age 18 between Nov. 23 and Dec. 6, 1988. The respondents included 1,099  nonsmokers and 401 smokers, the firm said.  </P> <P> An overwhelming number of those polled indicated they are satisfied with  current levels of smoking restrictions, and opposed outright bans in the  workplace or public areas.  </P></p>

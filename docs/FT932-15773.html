			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Charge in India for Union Carbide THE INDIAN subsidiary of Union Carbide, the US chemicals group, has been charged with manslaughter, in much-delayed legal action arising from the 1984 Bhopal gas explosion. Mr Keshub Mahindra, subsidiary chairman and a top Indian industrialist, and seven other past or present Union Carbide India employees, were also charged on Thursday. Charges have also been filed against the US parent company; Union Carbide (Eastern), the company's Hong Kong operation; and Mr Warren Anderson, who was the parent company chairman at the time of the explosion at the company's pesticide factory in Bhopal, central India. However, neither the parent company, nor the Hong Kong operation, nor Mr Anderson has appeared before Indian courts. All are being treated as absconders from Indian justice. More than 3,800 people were killed when a cloud of toxic gas escaped from storage tanks at the Bhopal plant. Tens of thousands were injured in one of the world's worst industrial disasters. About 40 people, including 11 soldiers, have been killed in the latest violence in India's troubled northern state of Kashmir. Six of the dead were soldiers killed when their Jeep was blown up on Thursday. Violence in Kashmir has been rising since 1989 as Kashmiri Moslems have been taking up arms in support of their political demands.</p>

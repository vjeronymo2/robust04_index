			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / International Company News: VW expected to build plant in Basque region CONFIRMATION that Volks-wagen, Europe's biggest carmaker, is investigating new investment possibilities in Spain yesterday fuelled speculation that the group may shortly unveil plans to build a revolutionary low-cost car production plant in the Basque country. Seat, VW's Spanish subsidiary, said 'some especially interesting' proposals had been put forward from regional authorities. Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the German group's Basque-born production director who recently defected from General Motors, campaigned fiercely at GM for his so-called Plateau 6 plant to be built in his homeland, where he retains strong political connections. The US group's refusal, and its preference for any future investments to be made in eastern Europe where costs are far below those in any European Community country, are understood to be the main reasons for his stormy departure from Detroit in March. Seat's statement yesterday, following the announcement that Mr Lopez is to hold press conferences in Hanover and Madrid next Monday, were widely seen as signalling confirmation that VW had accepted his proposals. Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, told shareholders last week that the group was planning a new plant to build a cheap 'people's car'. He did not say where or when. Mr Piech, who recently ordered that development of a brand-new plant in Mosel, eastern Germany, should be slowed because of industry-wide over-capacity and the worst market slump since the war, said the people's car could only be built in a new plant. Plateau 6 is a concept developed partly by Mr Lopez while he was at GM. It involves the assembly of cars from modules mainly shipped from outside suppliers, and installed by their staff. The object is to cut costs by reducing manufacturing time to around half the current European average.</p>

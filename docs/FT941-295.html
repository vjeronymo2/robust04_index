			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (6): More bad loans than expected - Collateral Until the collapse of the asset boom of the late 1980s, Japan had been gripped by the 'land legend' - that property prices never fell and that a piece of real estate would be the solution to any financial problem. Among the many believers were the country's banks, which lent limitlessly during the 1980s as long as the loans were backed by land collateral. However they have become casualties of the plunge in land prices and are burdened by mounting bad loans and the inability to sell the real estate collateral due to the property market's prolonged slump. The banks have recently started to tackle their bad loan problems due to the realisation among bureaucrats that the amount of bad loans are far larger than initially expected - widely believed to be about Y30,000bn at the top 21 banks. Although this approach deviates from the Ministry of Finance's traditional attitude to bad loans - where banks would sit on their bad and risky loans until the economy recovered rather than writing the loans off or making provisions - financial authorities fear that the financial system will face a credit crunch if the banks are unable to make new loans due to their deteriorating balance sheets. The need for banks to warehouse their bad loans until the real estate market and the economy recover led to the creation of the Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company (CCPC) established by the banks themselves a year ago. The CCPC was created after strong public opposition to the government's suggestions of using state funds to bail out the banks. The banks sell their bad debt backed by real estate collateral to the CCPC at a discount, subsequently writing the difference off as an income loss. The CCPC, which buys a loan with funds injected by the bank selling the loan, then tries to recover it, in some cases selling the property collateral to the real estate market. However, the efforts of the CCPC so far have raised doubts over how much of the banks' problems it can solve. Banks have sold Y2,857.1bn of their bad debt to the CCPC, but by the end of February, it has only been able to collect 0.6 per cent of the total loans purchased and has only managed to sell 0.5 per cent in land collateral. Since a bank's lending to one entity is limited to 20 per cent of the bank's capital, commercial bankers fear that unless the CCPC can dispose of the loans, a second and third CCPC would need to be created. The finance ministry is also considering plans to allow banks to set up subsidiaries which will buy land collateral from the banks at a court auction price. In short, the banks will sell the land to themselves, while booking the loss on the sale as a tax deduction. Mr James Fiorillo, financial analyst at brokers Baring Securities, reckons that the plan, if implemented, would speed up the disposal of bad debts since the possession of the land collateral will change from the original owner to the banks. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance has recently announced plans to allow banks to set up special purpose companies to which they can shift 'restructured loans' - loans on which banks have waived all or most of the interest to help restructuring - to non-bank financial institutions. According to IBCA, the UK bank credit rating agency, resolving the bad loan problem could cost the leading 21 banks more than Y10,000bn, assuming that a third of total problem loans needed to be written off. The banks are likely to write off or set provisions for some Y4,000bn this business year. They will be left with Y6,000bn plus further increases in bad loans which the agency expects will take at least three to five years for the stronger banks to resolve. However, plans where banks fund separate entities to buy and warehouse the bad or restructured loans and land collateral until the economy or real estate market picks up, leave the financial institutions vulnerable to a rise in interest rates. And while the schemes will speed up the process of bad loan write-offs - thus allowing banks to remove problem assets from their books - it will pose problems for investors because the complex structure and the lack of transparency make virtually impossible the assessment of the real risks which the banks face. When selling a bad loan to the CCPC, a bank will need to supply the funds in order for the purchasing company to buy it. In effect, the bank is changing a non-performing loan to a company into a performing loan extended to the CCPC. Since the banks only reveal non-performing loans on their balance sheets and not those transferred to the CCPC, the amount of disclosed bad loans will be significantly distorted. IBCA warns that such accounting practices deviate from western standards and are far from prudent. However, on the other hand, it claims that credit risks associated with Japanese banks remain low since the measures reflect a strong commitment of the financial authorities to maintain the integrity of the country's financial system. Rather than helping individual banks, the Ministry of Finance is providing support to the 'system' by establishing a framework in which banks can tackle their bad loan problems at their own pace with limited public scrutiny.</p>

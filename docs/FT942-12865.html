			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (4): Cross-border consensus remains elusive - Is the plan for a common European pension approach sunk? In public the pension Euro enthusiasts have not yet conceded defeat. In private, though, the mood is gloomy. Two years after the European Commission embarked on ambitious plans to create a common European pension fund system, complete with cross-border membership and full freedom of investment, the initiative now appears to have been all but sunk. For although European countries now face similar demographic pressures in their pension fund systems, with rising numbers of pensioners and a shrinking workforce, most member states seem far from ready to sacrifice their national pension quirks in the cause of a common European pension system. The essential problem stems from the sheer range of pension systems and tax relief regimes operating in the Europe - a state of affairs that leaves some countries, like the UK, relying on advance funding systems, others like Germany, use book reserving, and others, like France, depend on 'pay-as-you-go' schemes. This range has always made it difficult for European employees who wished to move around the union, not least because the different countries have generally refused to recognise each other's tax relief regimes. And so, mindful that pension harmony would be essential for a fully open labour market, the commission has hoped to encourage convergence along two distinct strands. The first, and most ambitious, has been a call for cross-border membership of pension schemes to allow European nationals to move around the community while remaining members of a single pension scheme. The second, more moderate initiative, has sought to encourage a free flow of pension fund investment across the community, together with freedom of operation for pension fund managers - a step that could potentially revolutionise Europe's capital markets, unlocking huge investment resources. Recognising that the first of these proposals was too ambitious for most member states to swallow rapidly, the commission began by targeting the second idea, proposing a directive intended to give fund managers freedom to invest overseas or in other currencies, by reducing the investment restrictions that now operate in most member states. The initiative received considerable support from the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands which impose few restrictions and consequently dominate the overseas investment market - according to the research carried out by the Federation of Retired People, the UK and Netherlands account for some 93 per cent of investment in overseas currencies among EU countries. However, the proposal was opposed by the other nine member states, where privately funded sectors are extremely limited, and investment restrictions in force. These range from a requirement in Spain and Portugal that pension funds be locally managed, to a German regulation stipulating that private pension funds cannot invest more than 5 per cent of their portfolios in non-German assets. In an effort to reach a compromise, the commission last year suggested that countries could be permitted to require that up to 60 per cent of a pension fund's assets were matched in national currencies or ECU. But this received a cool reception at a single market meeting last December, with the three 'liberal' countries insisting they were opposed to any restrictions - and the remaining nine demanding a higher limit of 80 per cent. The Commission responded by introducing more compromises - a text which would have allowed a pension fund manager from one state to act as a fund manager in another was quietly removed; the date of entry of the proposed directive was moved back by a year, to January 1997; and a currency matching limit of 70 per cent was suggested by the then Belgian presidency of the EU. But consensus remains elusive, not least because the commission itself is adamantly opposed to raising the limit. 'The Commission's view is that after research from experts the 80 per cent limit cannot be justified. There are benefits to be gained for pension fund managers from diversification of up to 35 or 40 per cent,' explains one commission official, who insists that higher limits would prevent the free flow of capital around the union - one of the fundamental principles of the single market. With the Greeks, who currently hold the presidency of the EU, insisting the matter should be a 'priority' case, more negotiations are planned in the summer. But observers warn that unless a solution is found soon, the directive is likely to be quietly shelved, not least because the next presidencies will be held by Germany and France - countries where privately funded pensions remain minimal. 'Personally I do not think anything will go through now,' says Mr Brian Hill of the EFRP. He admits the Federation is 'very disappointed' by the outcome, which appears to spell an end to plans for cross-border pension membership - a proposal that had been warmly supported by many multinationals who hoped it might allow them to streamline their pension schemes for their European employees. But although the deadlock has inevitably left countries like the UK disappointed, other observers remain rather more sanguine. According to Mr Richard Abramson, corporate pension fund manager with Ernst and Young, there is rising corporate pressure for a European approach. 'I have detected an increased interest by companies wanting a pan-European approach. The problem is that it is not possible while the obstacles are still there,' he says. Meanwhile, across Europe as a whole, more and more countries are now moving towards a funded model, he points out, as demographic pressures place their 'pay-as-you-go schemes' under intolerable strain. Spain, for example, has seen a gradual growth in the number of funded schemes over the past year, as a result of its own recent pension fund reforms. Meanwhile, France is slowly developing options for personal pension plans. Some hope that this trend may eventually bring more de facto convergence - or even result in a revival of the Commission's proposals. Indeed, as one diplomat who has closely observed the wrangles over the past year suggests, the main problem with the directive may have been its timing. 'Even if countries are moving towards a funded model like the UK, some seem to fear that the directive was pushing them down a path they were simply not ready for yet,' he insists. 'Almost all the European countries now agree that they have to review their social security systems. The problem is that pensions are a politically sensitive thing.'</p>

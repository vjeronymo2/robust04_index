			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Mauroy expected to announce resignation MR Pierre Mauroy is expected to announce his resignation as head of the French Socialist party this week, heralding a reshuffle of senior figures in the party in an attempt to revive its prospects for re-election. Socialist party officials would not confirm reports of the resignation yesterday, first leaked in the daily newspaper Liberation, which is close to the Socialist leadership. However, Mr Mauroy, a former prime minister, is believed to have already told President Francois Mitterrand of his decision to resign and is expected to make a public announcement tomorrow. Mr Mauroy is believed to be disillusioned with party infighting. Press reports said he wanted his job to go to an ally of a man widely seen as a leading contender to succeed Mr Mitterrand, European Commission head Jacques Delors. Mr Laurent Fabius, another former French prime minister, and Mr Michel Delebarre, minister of towns, have been mooted as the likeliest contenders to succeed him as head of the party. Mr Fabius, now president of the national assembly, has made no secret of his hopes of securing the position. Mr Delebarre is regarded as Mr Mauroy's own favoured candidate. However, Mr Mauroy's surprise departure would be likely to pave the way for a wider-ranging changes among the socialist hierarchy. The party is desperately trying to regain popularity in the approach to both this year's regional elections and to the national elections in 1993.</p>

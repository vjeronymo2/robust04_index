			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- Representatives of the  ruling coalition parties failed to agree on a policy platform  Tuesday [19 April] for forming a new government to replace the  cabinet of outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    The representatives resumed discussions on Tuesday morning  to  hammer out differences on two issues of immediate concern --  Japan's stance on North Korea's suspected nuclear arms  development program and tax system reform -- before nominating a  candidate for the premiership, party officials said.    They reached an accord on the North Korean nuclear issue but  failed to narrow differences over tax reform, the officials said.    It now seems that Deputy Prime Minister and concurrently  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata is a virtual certainty to be  elected the next prime minister. Michio Watanabe, an  influential figure in the opposition Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP), formally gave up his notion Tuesday to leave the party in  a bid to seek the premiership, hoping to gain the support of the  coalition.    Watanabe, 70, conveyed his decision in a third meeting with  LDP President Yohei Kono, who has himself vowed to run in a Diet  election to select a successor to Hosokawa, 56, who abruptly  announced his resignation on April 8 on account of his financial  improprieties.    The coalition representatives will resume talks Wednesday  and  the selection of Hata as a prime ministerial candidate by the  coalition chiefs was postponed to as early as Wednesday, they  said.    As a result, a Diet election to nominate Hosokawa's  successor  will take place as early as Thursday, parliamentary sources said.    Hata said Monday cabinet changes must be minimal after the  establishment of a new government.    On the North Korean nuclear problem, the representatives  agreed Japan should be prepared under the framework of the  Constitution for an emergency situation.    The agreement reached said Japan would adhere to the  policies  of the United Nations, and "the government should be prepared  under the framework of the Constitution for an emergency  situation."    It also said Japan should cooperate closely with the United  States and South Korea.    Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], which is led by Hata, has  called for a tougher stance against North Korea and urged a  revision of current laws, if necessary, to implement possible  economic sanctions against North Korea.    The Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest party in the  seven-party coalition, has voiced its opposition to sanctions.  Japan's Constitution renounces the use of force to settle  international disputes.    As for tax reform, Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa,  the chief strategist in the eight-month-old coalition, proposed  a sweeping tax reform centered on an indirect tax hike.    SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo rejected the proposal,  party officials said. The SDP has opposed the current 3 percent  consumption tax on almost all goods and services.    Hosokawa was forced to withdraw his plan in early February  to  introduce a fresh 7 percent "national welfare tax" to replace  the consumption tax after facing stiff opposition from the SDP,  which threatened to withdraw from the coalition.    The representatives were from the level of secretary general  of the SDP, Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), Komeito, the Japan  New Party (JNP), the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), the  Democratic Reform Party, a small parliamentary group in the  House of Councillors, and Kaikaku no Kai (Reform Society), a  small parliamentary group of LDP defectors in the House of  Representatives.    New party Sakigake (Harbinger), a small component in the  coalition, which declared Friday that it will not take a post in  the new cabinet because of disappointment over the issue of  picking a successor to Hosokawa, did not attend the session.    Sakigake led by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura  has said it will support the candidate agreed upon by the  coalition.</p>

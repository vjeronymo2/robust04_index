			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [KAZTAG report: "To Sharply Accelerate Economic Reform"] </F>   [Text] President Nursultan Nazarbayev held a conference on  the issues of speeding up the implementation of economic reform  in the Republic. Among the participants were Vice President Erik  Asanbayev, deputy prime ministers, state advisers and other  members of the government, top officials from the National Bank  and the National Academy of Sciences, and high-ranking staff of  the president's and the Cabinet of Ministers' apparat.    In his address at the conference, Nursultan Nazarbayev  emphasized the urgent need to accelerate the corrections to the  government's program of action in reforming the economy, as well  as improving the organization of this work and corresponding  mechanisms.    Since the time of introducing the national currency, the  heads of state and the government have issued more than 200  edicts, decrees, and directives of a normative-prescriptive  nature on the matters of development and intensification of  economic reform. Thereby a number of serious problems of a  legislative nature have been resolved, and the normative base  considerably updated.    However, noted the president, a system approach and  purposefulness are still lacking in the implementation of the  entire complex of envisaged measures; there is insufficient  coordination in the activities of ministries and government  apparat offices in the preparation of normative-prescriptive  documents and the organization of their implementation in  practice. There are also disjointed actions between the National  Bank and the Cabinet of Ministers in conducting a single strict  financial-credit policy. Nor has the principal task of creating  within the framework of the government and its structures an  effective executive mechanism been resolved.    As a result, the process--from the moment documents are  adopted to the point of their practical implementation--is  stretched out impermissibly long and most normative acts are  left hanging in midair. Moreover, some of them are consciously  sabotaged. This is especially typical of those acts that involve  changes in the administrative structure in industrial sectors.  Operational decisions and measures adopted by ministries and the  National Bank often are not correlated with one another or they  contradict the program line.    For the purpose of streamlining this work, as well as  preparing the Program of Anticrisis Measures and Economic  Stabilization for 1994-95, a republic commission was set up by  the president's decree in January of this year. However, it  still has not completed the draft of this important document and  incorporated in it existing alternative proposals, in which  there are also healthy nuggets of wisdom. Such procrastination  is unacceptable, and it is not accidental that it causes  resentment among the economic public and in the mass media. The  commission should finally determine, urgently and clearly, which  parts of alternative programs may be used for the benefit of the  business at hand, and what should be discarded for the lack of  constructive contents, and make the results public, thus putting  an end to idle talk.    Unenviable fate also befell the latest plan of government  actions--for the implementation of economic policy in 1944. The  control functions had been assigned to the Ministry of the  Economy, which itself is not succeeding in the execution of this  document. In addition, some ministries, bypassing the Ministry  of the Economy, petition the government to move the time frame  for the implementation of one or another part, or revise them.  This cannot go on any longer, said Nursultan Nazarbayev.    In connection with the current situation, he brought up a  number of cardinal proposals aimed at accelerating development  of a program to intensify the reform.    The main emphasis, in the president's opinion, should be  placed on increasing authority and dramatically improving the  activities of executive power structures and state organs of  administration. The measures necessary for this have been  outlined; they are to be conducted within several areas.    The first is the legal base for the reform. The normative  base with respect to main economic spheres and direction of the  reform, created by the president's and government's decisions  since the introduction of the national currency, should be  systematically organized and evaluated to provide a sufficient  base, and where additional development of normative acts is  needed.    The next area is effective use of aid provided by the world  community. All channels of financial aid from international  organizations and foreign countries going through the government  need to be merged within directions, economic sectors, and the  Republic's social sphere. It is also important to work out the  main principles and mechanisms of its utilization, including  program support, state structures and other institutions  responsible for project implementation, and the use and  repayment of credits and loans received for such use.    Next, development of individual spheres of domestic economic  policy. In this area it is necessary to fully evaluate the real  structural transformations that have been accomplished in the  national economy. Large-scale projects of national significance  and ones that are ready for implementation need to be selected,  and the measures of support in corresponding decisions be  drafted. It is also necessary to define economic spheres and  sectors that will be developing along the lines of separate  programs--entrepreneurship, insurance operations, defense and  other complexes--and set strict deadlines, as well as designate  those responsible for the preparation of real programs.    Among other subjects mentioned were the expedience of  drafting five-year plans by indicators, beginning with 1995;  further support for privatization processes and holding  structures, giving them greater freedom of action; facilitating  development of consumer goods production; increasing the volume  of processing of agricultural products; reorganizing the work of  the state statistics system, which in many respects still  operates in the old mode; and other current problems.    The decisive factor in achieving the goals set is good  organization of the work of state organs and the entire  executive apparat. This means that distribution of powers and  functions between ministries and other government organs must be  analyzed and revised, and as a result the responsibility for  implementation of a specific area of economic policy clearly  assigned to each. It appears that in this respect it will be  necessary to eliminate the still-existing duplication of effort,  which will require structural changes with sensible staff  reductions.    Among those who participated in the subsequent exchange of  opinions were First Deputy Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin,  Deputy Prime Minister Zhanybek Karibzhanov, and the State  Antitrust Policy Committee Chairman Petr Svoyikh. Deputy Prime  Minister Sergey Kulagin reported on the progress of preparation  for the spring sowing campaign.    It has been decided to complete preparation for the program  for activation of implementation of the economic reform within a  compressed time frame and to discuss it immediately afterwards.  The president also intends to consider in the nearest future the  issues associated with denationalization and privatization,  adjustments to the program of social protection of the  population, housing policy, and intensification of suppression  of crime.</p>

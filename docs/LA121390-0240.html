Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> THIMBLE BRINGS RECORD $38,600  </P> <P> A 16th-Century gold thimble believed to have belonged to Queen Elizabeth I was  bought by London jewelers today for $38,600, a record price for a thimble.  </P> <P> The 1-inch-long thimble, set with tiny rubies and paste sapphires, was probably  part of a gift from the Mogul Empire in India to the queen. It was later given  to one of her ladies-in-waiting.  </P> <P> The previous record price for a thimble was $14,600.  </P> <P> The thimble was from the estate of Dorothy Silvester. She inherited a  collection from her mother, Dorothy Howell, once described in a collectors'  guide as "The Queen of Thimbles."  </P></p>

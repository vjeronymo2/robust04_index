			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Alejandro Noemi tendered his resignation as Codelco  [Copper Corporation] executive manager, which was accepted by  President Patricio Aylwin at Cerro Castillo Palace this morning.    Alejandro Noemi leaves his post as top leader of the most  important Chilean enterprise exactly 10 days after the scandal  affecting Codelco was made public.    The first indications of his pending resignation appeared  yesterday when the report on the investigation headed by Noemi  himself stated that the Codelco executive manager was mainly  responsible for the disaster caused by Juan Pablo Davila.    This morning, however, nobody thought Noemi would tender his  resignation today. This morning everything seemed normal at  Codelco. Executive Vice President Maximo Pacheco was the only  one to enter Codelco offices on Huerfanos Street.    Outside the building some workers were mopping up the eggs  thrown yesterday by a group of pensioners.    The calm atmosphere did not last long. The announcement made  at 1300 by Interior Minister Enrique Krauss unleashed a storm.    [Begin Krauss recording] Today Alejandro Noemi Callejas  tendered his resignation as Codelco executive manager. The  president of the Republic has decided to accept his resignation  even though he will place this information at the disposal of  Codelco management, which will make the final decision on the  subject. [end recording]    From then on the media frenetically searched for the  resigning manager and did not find Noemi until 1700 as he  arrived home from Cerro Castillo.    [Begin recording] [Noemi] I think I have done what I had to  do following this disaster. We have completed the investigation  and I think it is clear...[changes thought] you saw it and  learned about its contents yesterday. Moreover, the necessary  measures have been taken. The path to be followed has been  defined in order to administer these losses. I do hope the  losses will drop. I have done my duty to show my face, as you  have seen during these past few days, and there is no point in  me remaining at Codelco after this regretful episode. It is  very hard to continue at the head of an enterprise... I can no  longer show face.    [Unidentified reporter] How do you feel having to resign for  a mistake you did not make?    [Noemi] Such is life. I am very sorry. I am very sad and  do not feel as calm as I look. I am very sad, very sorry. It  will be very sad to be remembered as manager of this enterprise  because of this mistake. [end recording]    Noemi added that despite the modernization carried out  within  Codelco these past four years there is still a lot to be done,  and proof of this is the disaster caused by Juan Pablo Davila.    Noemi said that in the future the enterprise must be more  agile. He also was asked whether he will receive indemnization.    [Begin recording] [Noemi] Yes, I am entitled to it, but I  am not going to accept it, not because I feel guilty but rather  because I am too hurt to even think about it or think that  someone may misinterpret it. Yes, I am entitled to it; it is  part of my pay. I believe I have done a good job at Codelco and  hope this will be noticed with time.    [Reporter] How do you feel about the fact that the other  three Codelco managers did accept indemnization?    [Noemi] I feel it was a major mistake, a major mistake, and  hope they will return it. [end recording]    Noemi's resignation should be ratified on 7 February by  Codelco management, which also must accept the president of the  Republic's proposal that current Finance Under Secretary Jorge  Rodriguez head the most important Chilean enterprise for the  next 37 days.</p>

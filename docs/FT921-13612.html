			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Management (In A Nutshell): Franchise for job creation Nearly 6,000 new jobs have been created by franchised businesses over the past year despite a fall in levels of turnover, according to a survey* by the British Franchise Association (BFA) and National Westminster Bank. A total of 189,500 people are now employed in the franchise sector, the survey found. But combined sales in the year ended June 1991 fell from Pounds 5.2bn in 1990 to Pounds 4.8bn. The number of franchised outlets rose from 18,260 to 18,600 and franchisors expect the number to double by 1996. The number of franchise systems available rose by 14 per cent from 379 to 432. The failure rate of franchised businesses rose from 5.7 per cent a year to 7.2 per cent but was still below that of non-franchised businesses, the survey's authors said. *From BFA, Thames View, Newtown Road, Henley on Thames, Oxon RG9 1HG.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Shim'on Schiffer] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin does not intend to do  anything about evacuating the Jewish settlers from Hebron and  transferring them to Qiryat Arba' or other locations.    Rabin believes that such a move would set a dangerous  precedent that would serve as an incentive for the Palestinian  terrorist organizations operating against the settlements in the  territories.    Rabin transmitted his position on the matter to U.S.  Administration sources with whom he spoke over recent days. In  the prime minister's view, a decision to evacuate the Hebron  settlers would also lead to the opening of the Israeli-PLO  agreement, which is contrary to Israel's current interest.    A majority was developing in the cabinet last week for  evacuating the settlers in Hebron, mainly for security reasons.    The United States is exerting pressure on Rabin to take a  series of steps to make it easier for 'Arafat to return to the  negotiating table following the Hebron massacre. The U.S.  Administration is pressuring for a withdrawal of the IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] from Hebron's central bus station. The  Americans claim that if Rabin cannot evacuate the settlers, then  he can at least make a gesture to the Arabs in Hebron, and  evacuate the central bus station area, which the IDF took  control of several months ago.    Rabin has so far also rejected this U.S. request, claiming  that planned Palestinian retaliation against the Hebron settlers  is prohibiting any thinning of forces or a withdrawal from the  bus station. Rabin made it clear to the Americans that he  cannot and will not do anything beyond what he has already done  to tighten supervision over the settlers.    In talks the prime minister will hold in Washington this  week, he will also raise the issue of growing military  cooperation being between Russia and Syria, in the wake of  recent reports reaching Israel that Russia has renewed contacts  with Syria, offering it sophisticated military equipment.    Rabin is due to inform the cabinet today of steps he intends  to take to outlaw Kakh and Kahana Hay, based on Attorney General  Mikha'el Ben-Ya'ir's opinion, presented to the prime minister  over the weekend. The opinion advocates measures to declare  them terrorist organizations under the antiterrorism law.</p>

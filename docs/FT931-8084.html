			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Food and Drink: Appetisers CHARDONNAY at Pounds 2.99? An oxymoron, surely, unless that Chardonnay is unrecognisable and/or Bulgarian. A white burgundy sort of Chardonnay at Pounds 2.99? A cruel joke, surely, unless it is the Laboure-Roi Bourgogne Grand Ordinaire on offer at Majestic wine warehouses from February 23 until March 21. The bottle I tasted not only looked worth twice the price, it almost tasted it too. Majestic has 14 burgundies on special offer over this period, with such wines as remain being 'on taste' over the weekend of March 6/7. The red counterpart to this BGO is Pounds 3.99 with the grand Pinot Noir grape fleshed out with some of Beaujolais' Gamay. Best value in red wines is Faiveley's 1989 Bourgogne Rouge at Pounds 5.99 - thoroughly serious for drinking over the next two years. 'In the twenties, we danced,' wrote Dame Barbara Cartland in the foreword to The Complete Hostess by Giovanni Quaglino. She would have interrupted her dancing to eat, from La Grande Carte, Tournedos at 3/6d or half a lobster Delmonico at four shillings, and a bottle of Chateau d'Yquem 1920 at Pounds 2. The prices will have changed but last week Quaglino's reopened on the same site in London's Bury Street, SW1 (tel: 071-930-6767) a West End outpost of the Terence Conran empire. It will be interesting to see whether, for the first time since Conran appointed Simon Hopkinson as Head Chef at Bibendum, he has found another chef (this time Martin Webb) whose culinary skills can match Conran's undoubted eye for design.</p>

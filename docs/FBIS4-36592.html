			<p>BFN     [Text] Salih Abu-Bakr Bin-Husaynun, the minister of oil  and minerals and military commander of the interior axis,  praised the state of Kuwait's principled stand. He praised  Kuwait's press for its covering of the events. Mr. Bin-Husaynun  said in a contact with the AL-QABAS newspaper, published today,  that the northern forces had attacked yesterday morning the  southern forces at al-'Akbar/Askar axis, and that after violent  fighting several northern tanks were destroyed and 11 soldiers  were taken prisoner. Bin- Husaynun said that the battle on this  axis had begun on 2 June, when the Maghawir forces tried to  infiltrate into Khash'in al-Ayn, and were repelled by our forces  after fierce fighting. Our Armed Forces destroyed a tank  squadron and took 15 soldiers prisoner. The enemy ran away,  leaving back a number of artillery, and killed and injured  soldiers. Last Tuesday [7 June] the northern forces launched an  attack, despite the cease-fire declaration. The enemy suffered  the destruction of seven tanks, and the death of soldiers and  imprisoning of others, and the shooting down of a MiG-21  warplane.</p>

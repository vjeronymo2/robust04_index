			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cash shortage holds up Ivorian coffee deliveries THE START of the Ivory Coast's 1991-92 coffee season is being delayed while the commodities marketing board, the Caisse de Stabilisation, tries to find cash to subsidise the crop, trades said, reports Reuter from Abidjan. The government has not yet announced the start of the buying season - normally December - although farmers say they have finished most of their picking and are having to store the berries themselves. 'Everyone's ready for the coffee, but the banks are refusing to start until they're sure they'll get money from the caisse,' one up-country buyer said. The Ivory Coast, Africa's biggest coffee grower, produced between 250,000 and 270,000 tonnes in 1990-91, according to trade and government sources. Low world coffee prices mean the Caistab must subsidise this year's crop by some CFA Fr23bn (Pounds 47m) after keeping prices to farmers at an artificially high CFA Fr100 a kilogram to support production. But farmers say they cannot make ends meet even at this price. They have cut back on hired labour and farm chemicals, leaving more and more coffee unpicked and lowering Ivory Coast's total output. Traders said some Fr12bn to Fr13bn francs of the coffee subsidy was already accounted for, to be recouped from levies on exports of the profitable cocoa crop. Exporters had to pay the Caistab an explicit coffee subsidy of 17 CFA francs on each kilogram of cocoa this year, they said. 'The caisse has to prove it can find the Fr10bn difference,' one Abidjan trader said, adding: 'The banks are refusing to finance and, until the banks finance, there will be no buying.' Banks and shippers have been hit badly in the past by huge Caistab debts. According to the traders the Caistab's partial subsidy of coffee through cocoa shippers went against pressure from the World Bank, which is overseeing liberalisation of Ivory Coast's commodity marketing system. 'The World Bank said Ivory Coast should finance coffee itself,' one said.</p>

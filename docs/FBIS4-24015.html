			<p>BFN     [Text] The dust surrounding the fuel price refuses to  settle, and it looks as though the government is beginning to  yield to pressure to deregulate it.    Mineral and Energy Affairs Minister Pik Botha has announced  that the government has requested a fuel task force to make  proposals by August for a new way to determine the fuel price.  Mr. Botha today said in a media information session that the  extent to which the government should get involved in the fuel  industry must also be looked at. The task force will make  proposals on the degree to which the fund should buy and sell,  and will also look at the tariff protection of SASOL [South  African Coal, Oil and Gas Corporation] and Mossgas [Mossel Bay  Gas Project]. Mr. Botha said the government wanted to  depoliticize the fuel issue and find an answer that will best  benefit the consumer.    Meanwhile, the director general of Pick 'n Pay, Mr. Gareth  Ackerman, announced that from Monday the chain store group will  sell its gas at the recommended price. He said in a message to  branch managers that he had held discussions with Mr. Botha, and  progress had been made in efforts to deregulate the fuel price.</p>

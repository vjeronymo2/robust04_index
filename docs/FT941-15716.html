			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney's week of reckoning  -Rescue negotiations are at a delicate stage If all goes well, a team of auditors at KPMG Peat Marwick in Paris should this week put the finishing touches to a preliminary report on the financial condition of Euro Disney, the stricken leisure group struggling to avert bankruptcy. The report will be distributed to the 60 international banks that own Euro Disney's FFr20.3bn (Dollars 3.43bn) net debt. The banks are expected to spend next week scrutinising the report in the hope of later this month starting full-scale negotiations over a rescue package with Euro Disney and Walt Disney, its US parent company. The critical question as the two sides prepare for the final stage of negotiations is whether they will be able to agree a deal to rescue Euro Disney and to save the EuroDisneyland theme park from closure. Euro Disney's position is clear. Bruised by recession and crippled by debt, it made a net loss of FFr5.3bn in the year to September 30. It has repeatedly warned that it risks running out of cash. When that happens, the US group has promised to keep EuroDisneyland going - but only until March 31. If the banks have not agreed a deal by then, Disney will pull the plug. Euro Disney would be wound up, leaving the banks to write off their loans. Disney, advised by Lazard Freres in New York, has already suggested a solution. It asked the banks at a November meeting in Paris to accept proposals to halve Euro Disney's debt through a FFr5bn rights issue and a debt-for-equity swap. It has also asked Caisse de Depots, the state financial institution that holds Euro Disney's FFr4.8bn fixed interest rate debt, to reduce the rate payable from the present 7.8 per cent. Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in London, calculates that such a package would 'reduce Euro Disney's losses in the 1994 and 1995 financial years' and enable it to produce 'a very small profit' in 1996. Walt Disney is doubtless gambling that it has enough leverage over the banks to persuade them to agree. The French government, which would be loathe to lose over 10,000 jobs at EuroDisneyland at a time of rising unemployment, could use its influence to persuade the Caisse des Depots and other French creditors - including Banque Nationale de Paris, Indosuez and Credit Agricole - to accept. Disney could try to influence US creditors such as J. P. Morgan and Citibank. It has considerable clout in US banking circles, thanks to its policy of holding 'beauty contests' for its deals rather than retaining a house bank. If the French and US creditors said 'yes', Disney could be reasonably hopeful that the remaining Japanese, German and UK banks (which hold a smaller chunk of the total debt) would fall into line. The hitch is that the banks are anxious to minimise their exposure by ensuring that Disney is involved with the rescue. 'Disney got us into this mess and, frankly, it's going to have to bear its fair share of the pain,' said one banker involved with the negotiations. Disney would, of course, be expected to participate fully in the rights issue. This would represent an investment of roughly FFr2.45bn for its 49 per cent stake. However, it would be reluctant to raise its equity stake further because, under US regulations, it would then have to consolidate Euro Disney's debt on to its own balance sheet. However, Disney might be persuaded to buy assets, such as its hotels, from Euro Disney, or to use its influence to attract new equity investors. New York analysts report strong demand for Euro Disney's debt on the second-hand market. A FFr130m parcel of debt is believed to have been sold earlier this month in London for 60 per cent of its original value. This suggests that there is interest in Euro Disney as a distressed investment. However, the banks are determined to force Disney to make concessions by reducing its royalty fee on Euro Disney's revenue worth FFr262m last year. 'It's the least Disney can do, particularly as it expects us to take equity,' said one. 'The structure of those fees will make a tremendous difference to Euro Disney's financial performance.' The banks may also try to protect their investment by insisting on changes in the management of EuroDisneyland. They have asked KPMG to review the running of the park, as well as its finances, to see if Disney's present strategy is the right one. So far, Disney's conduct of the negotiations has been anything but conciliatory. One banker present at the November meeting described the Disney team as 'arrogant and overbearing'. 'Disney is used to success,' said another. 'It hasn't had any experience of a mess like this. And it shows.' Recent warnings from Disney that it will close EuroDisneyland if the talks fail appear to have aggravated the situation. 'We've gone into this hoping that if we work like crazy over the next few months we can save Euro Disney,' said one creditor. 'We can do without these threats. Disney's aggressive attitude may be a negotiating ploy, but I'm not sure that it's a good one.'</p>

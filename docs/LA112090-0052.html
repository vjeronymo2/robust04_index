			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FIGHT OVER FORMER SITE OF CARWASH TAKES A NEW FORM  </P> <P> The celebrated carwash itself may be gone, but Studio City's battle over the  site where the neighborhood landmark formerly stood continued Monday, with  development opponents citing liquor and zoning laws instead of the cultural  memorabilia of the 1950s.  </P> <P> Leaders of a neighborhood group fought the issuance of city conditional-use  permits for three trendy Westside restaurants and a stereo store proposed for  the two-story Laurel Promenade shopping center under construction at Ventura  and Laurel Canyon boulevards.  </P> <P> The construction site was the focus of a nationally publicized controversy last  year when opponents of the shopping center development led an effort to declare  the carwash that stood on the site a culturally significant example of 1950s  architecture. The preservation effort was widely viewed as a creative ploy to  stop more development along busy Ventura Boulevard.  </P> <P> Although the developer, Ira Smedra, eventually won a lawsuit against the city  over the cultural landmark issue and successfully obtained a building permit,  the carwash battle left bitter feelings between the developer and neighborhood  activists.  </P> <P> Studio City Residents Assn. President Polly Ward complained during Monday's  hearing at the Van Nuys Woman's Club that Ventura Boulevard already has too  many bars and restaurants serving alcohol, and that installation of car stereo  systems by a proposed store would disturb neighbors.  </P> <P> Smedra called Ward's objections just an extension of "the ongoing campaign  against us."  </P> <P> "I would deny blocking anything," replied Ward. "He is exhibiting such chutzpah  coming in and asking for three restaurants."  </P> <P> Zoning Administrator Robert Janovici said he would issue a written decision in  10 days. Both sides vowed to appeal the outcome if it is not to their liking.  </P> <P> The three restaurants -- Kaktus, the Daily Grill and Louise's Trattoria -- have  signed leases with Smedra and are in the process of applying for liquor  licenses with the city's Alcohol and Beverage Control Board.  </P> <P> The Daily Grill and Louisa's would serve beer and wine, their managers told  Janovici. Kaktus needs a hard-liquor permit, owner Richard Sneider said,  because margaritas are "part of Mexican culture."  </P> <P> Ira Handelman, a consultant to Smedra, called all three restaurants  "first-class establishments" and told Janovici the shopping center would  provide adequate parking.  </P> <P> But Ward said three alcohol-serving restaurants was too many for one shopping  center.  </P> <P> Armed with a list of neighborhood restaurants and bars, she said there are  already 30 restaurants with alcohol permits within a one-mile radius of  Smedra's shopping center, and more than 60 such establishments in Studio City.  </P> <P> "It's just too much. And this doesn't count the liquor stores in all the  mini-malls," Ward said.  </P> <P> She also objected to a conditional-use permit for The Good Guys, an  audio-visual retail outlet that installs stereo systems in customers' cars.  </P> <P> Handelman said the stereo installation would take place in an area of the  shopping center's underground garage, too far for residents to hear any  equipment testing. He and Smedra also suggested that Ward's objections were  hypocritical because her group had attempted to save a busy gas station and  carwash.  </P> <P> Ward and association board member Neil Finestone were the only residents to  attend the afternoon hearing. Ward said the Studio City Residents Assn.  represents the occupants of 1,300 homes.  </P></p>

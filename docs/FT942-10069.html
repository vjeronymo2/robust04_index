			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Lens flexes to focus on UK's underperformers: A 'predator' with a difference British companies be warned: Mr Robert Monks, a prominent member of the US shareholder rights movement and scourge of poorly performing American businesses, may cross the Atlantic in search of UK targets. Mr Monks runs Lens Inc, a fund management group he set up two years ago, which takes stakes in US companies with bad financial track records and then agitates for change, hoping the improvement will lift the company's share price. Mr Monks hopes to do the same in the UK, in the first significant expansion of this type of fund outside the US. But he says he needs to find a British investment partner who can give him a good feel for local conditions. 'A lot of our comfort here (in the US) is that we really do understand the idiom . . . which in the UK we patently do not,' says Mr Monks, a Harvard-educated lawyer who also studied at Oxford and helped foundthe US corporate governance movement. He is analysing UK companies, plans a reconnaissance trip in July, and may take a stake in a British group by the year's end. The US corporate governance movement, dominated by large US public pension plans such as California's Calpers, pressures companies to establish structures to make managements more accountable to shareholders - for example, by ensuring that a majority of directors are from outside the business. Some funds also try to establish a dialogue with poorly performing companies on possible strategic change. Lens is unlike other governance activists. First, it actively seeks out underperforming companies. Many of the large public pension funds acquire stakes in underperformers passively, as they are indexed funds whose investments replicate the components of important stock market indices. Second, whereas the public pension funds tend to be discreet, Lens is confrontational if dialogue attempts are rebuffed. 'We are willing to be loud,' says Ms Nell Minow, a partner in Lens who is also a force in the corporate governance movement. Lens may spearhead campaigns against companies which conservative US funds shy away from. Lens consequently has an influence disproportionate to its tiny size. The fund has only Dollars 15m of money under management, mostly belonging to Mr Monks and Ms Minow, having failed to attract large institutional investors when first established. Even Calpers, a long-time ally in the corporate governance movement, turned Lens down, arguing that it was itself pursuing Lens' strategy. Mr Monks argues that public pension funds like Calpers, which ultimately report to political masters, are wary of Lens' confrontational reputation. 'The risk-reward ratio for public servants inhibits them from doing something that involves the possibility of political embarrassment.' Mr Monks nevertheless has a strong track record at fomenting corporate change. He rocked the board of Sears, Roebuck by running as an independent director - a campaign which crystallised investor unhappiness with the company and led to a shake-up of its retailing side and the spin-off of financial services. Sears was one of four companies comprising Lens' initial portfolio. The others - American Express, Eastman Kodak and Westinghouse Electric - have all ousted their chief executives and begun strategy changes. The rise in most of these companies' shares meant that, in its first year, Lens had a return on its portfolio of 26.1 per cent, some 18.9 per cent better than the Standard &amp; Poors 500. Mr Monks says that so far this year fund's total return is about 10 per cent. Mr Monks is focussing his energies on Stone &amp; Webster, where he holds 1 per cent of the stock. He argues the company's sharp decline in profits during the past five years relates to poor management and corporate governance structure. The company's own employee benefit plan holds about 37 per cent of the stock and a further 12 per cent of its capital is in restricted stock in the hands of employees. The result, Mr Monks argues, is a business being being run as a private company despite its public shareholders. He suggests management should consider buying out shareholders and taking it fully private. Stone &amp; Webster acknowledges its results have not been satisfactory, but says no helpful ideas have come from Lens. Mr Monks uses Lens as an agenda-setter, highlighting corporate governance issues which he considers of general importance. In the Stone &amp; Webster campaign he wants to point up the role of employee share schemes in protecting under-performing companies and what he calls 'an appalling unspoken conflict of interest' among Wall Street firms. He argues that large US banks and security houses which act as fund trustees are unlikely to act as proper fiduciaries of these shares - for example, by voting against poor managements - as they, or other members of the Wall Street investment banking club, are likely to have business links with the underperforming companies. 'The great and the good (of Wall Street) are simply not going to ever put themselves in a position where they become unclubbable,' he says. If he finds the right British partner, the City of London might soon be listening to equally forthright judgements.</p>

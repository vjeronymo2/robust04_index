			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas set to delay launch of jumbo jet McDONNELL Douglas, the financially-stretched US aerospace group, appears to have virtually abandoned hope of launching its much-trumpeted MD-12 jumbo jet in 1992 because of a lack of orders. The blow comes on top of McDonnell Douglas's continuing difficulties in attracting Asian investment to the project, which is widely regarded as crucial to the company's future in commercial aviation. The company is also engaged in a substantial round of job cuts at its commercial aircraft division in southern California as it grapples with a deteriorating market for commercial jets. McDonnell Douglas had hoped to launch the MD-12 programme before the end of 1992. However, a company spokesman acknowledged yesterday the financial difficulties facing the world's airlines meant that 'it may not happen this year'. He insisted that many airlines had responded 'very positively' to the new aircraft but acknowledged that none had placed orders for it. 'We're going to wait for the market,' he said. 'We're ready to launch it when they are ready.' The MD-12 would challenge Boeing's 747-400 at the top end of the market. In a bold move last April to take the commercial initiative, McDonnell Douglas scrapped earlier plans for a three-engine aircraft in favour of a four-engined one with two passenger levels. This aircraft could eventually be stretched into a super-jumbo, carrying more than 600 passengers, which would make it the largest on the market. Analysts say that if the company fails to get the MD-12 into production it will be doomed to inexorable decline in the commercial aircraft business, because it offers a much narrower range of products than Boeing or Airbus Industrie of Europe. It cannot afford the development costs of the MD-12, which are estimated at more than Dollars 5bn, and to fund the jet it has been discussing selling up to 49 per cent of its commercial aviation business to Asian and European investors, notably Taiwan Aerospace, which last year reached a tentative agreement to buy a 40 per cent stake. However, the Taiwan company, under pressure from hostile legislators, has grown more wary of a deal and is concerned about the uncertain commercial potential of the new aircraft. McDonnell Douglas yesterday faced problems on another front when a Pentagon report, leaked to the press, alleged that senior government officials had rushed through the approval of new versions of the company's F/A-18 fighter without a proper evaluation. The report is ammunition for Congressional critics of the F/A-18 seeking to slow or halt the programme. McDonnell Douglas shares reacted to the flurry of bad news by dropping Dollars 1 1/2 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange, to stand at Dollars 38 1/4 at close of trade.</p>

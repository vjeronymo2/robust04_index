			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] New Delhi, March 29 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysian  Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said Tuesday [29 March] the  West's attempts to push developing countries to have a minimum  wage for workers were directed at producer nations such as  Malaysia, Indonesia and India.    The attempts to impose the minimum wage started after the  Group of Seven (G-7) held a meeting recently to discuss  unemployment in the developed countries, he told Malaysian  journalists covering the ongoing summit of the Group of 15  (G-15) developing countries here.    Their aim is clear, they want to make it impossible for us  to  sell our goods.    When workers are paid high wages, factories will have to  close, the workers will lose their jobs and then the  unemployment in the developed countries will be solved, he said.    Dr. Mahathir said the developed countries did not take into  account the fact that the standard of living was usually low in  developing countries and that the workers were not yet ready to  adjust to a high standard of living. All this while, the  developed countries had imposed various regulations on  developing countries linked with trade, such as the question of  democracy, human rights and the environment.    He said the heads of government at the G-15 summit where  they  had raised the issue of the minimum wage, agreed that developing  countries did not want the West to impose its systems and  perceptions on the issues of democracy, human rights, the  environment and minimum wage.    The question of trade should be separate from any unrelated  condition, he said, adding that Western countries seemed [word  indistinct]. He said, the United States still talked of Super  301, on the imposition of conditions on certain countries in  their trade.    Dr. Mahathir also said that the plenary session of the G-15  summit was agreed that the structure of the United Nations must  be reorganised for it to be more democratic.    He said it was undemocratic for a superpower in the UN to  veto the wish of the majority of member nations.    If this continues, their talk of democracy will be  meaningless. They want to force democracy on all other countries  but there is no democracy in the UN itself, he said.    Dr. Mahathir said the voice of the majority could not be  simply dismissed just because five big countries in the UN held  the veto power.    He also said the other G-15 member countries shared  Malaysia's view that the Western media always carried adverse  reports on the developing countries.    However, he added, some of these countries feared that they  would be the target of the Western media if they stated their  stand openly in the matter.    Dr. Mahathir said the Western countries assumed that they  had  more rights than other countries.    While we do not interfere in their affairs, they feel they  can not only interfere in ours but also direct any country to  follow their concepts, failing which they will impose various  forms of pressure, he said.    He said Western countries had yet to understand that a  sovereign nation had the right to manage its domestic matters on  its own.</p>

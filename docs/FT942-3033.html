			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / International Company News: Vilmorin agrees to buy Suttons Seeds Vilmorin, the French company which is the world leader in garden seeds, yesterday continued its international expansion by agreeing to buy Suttons Seeds in the UK from Volvo, the Swedish motor group. The deal was for an undisclosed sum. It marks an important stage in Vilmorin's development as Suttons is one of the oldest and best-known brand names in the buoyant UK garden products market with a dominant share of the seeds sector. Vilmorin, which has seed interests in Germany, Spain and Italy, has for some time been eager to expand into the UK. It seized its chance to win control of Suttons when Procordia, the Volvo subsidiary that owns the company, put it up for sale as part of a long-term policy of shedding peripheral businesses. Suttons, based at Torquay in Devon, claims 40 per cent of the UK garden seed sales. The seed market has flourished in recent years thanks to the heightened interest in gardening. Suttons in 1993 made net profits of Pounds 427,000 on turnover of Pounds 15m (Dollars 22.7m). Procordia has for the past 18 months been in discussions with Vilmorin to finalise the deal. The French group, which made static pre-tax profits of FFr70m (Dollars 12.3m) on sales of FFr1.12bn in its last financial year to June 30, won control of Suttons against offers from a number of UK companies. Mr Pierre Lefebvre, chief executive of Vilmorin, said the deal should enable Suttons to improve its performance by accelerating its development under the aegis of its new parent company. Vilmorin, which last autumn joined the Paris secondary market, has a long-term strategy of heavy investment in product development. The group plans to increase sales in southern and eastern Europe. It intends to expand into south-east Asia, notably Japan, although Mr Lefebvre said it was difficult to find acquisitions in that market.</p>

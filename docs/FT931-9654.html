			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Technology: A new resin takes the floor - Worth Watching Formaldehyde is widely used in the production of vinyl kitchen floors and other flooring and roofing materials - but it's best known as a poison. Most attempts to find a substitute have failed on grounds of physical performance. But a company in Philadelphia claims to have developed an alternative that matches the performance of formaldehyde binders and resins. Rohm and Haas say the tensile strength of its water-based acrylic resin permits lower fibreglass weights and therefore cuts costs. Rohm and Haas: US, 215 592 3000; UK, 081 686 8844.</p>

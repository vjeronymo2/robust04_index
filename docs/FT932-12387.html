			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: India drops sharply ahead of budget vote - RC Murthy writes on Indian equities and John Pitt on emerging markets in March Concern over the stability of the Narasimha Rao administration has come once again to the forefront as parliament reassembled last week for the crucial vote on this year's Indian budget, driving equities to a 15-month low. The Hindu revivalist Bharatiya Janta party, the main opposition, has announced plans to try to unseat the administration, and other parties are threatening to join in. However, none of these opponents wants mid-term elections and it appears that a compromise may be reached which could see the budget through parliament during the next fortnight. Equity prices have fallen due to the uncertainty, with the BSE index down at 2,100 at the weekend. Prices dropped by a further 63 points on Monday, bringing the total decline to 423 points, or 17 per cent, in six weeks. The BSE indicator yesterday recovered some ground, finishing 33.19 up at 2,070.00. The focus now is on the R40bn (Dollars 1.3bn) Bombay securities scandal and deliberations of the joint parliamentary committee, which is to finalise its report in a fortnight. Venezuela and India featured as the worst performers among the world's emerging markets in March, while Mexico, supported by lower inflation and interest rates, moved ahead. Disappointment with the February 27 budget, which did not cut corporation tax as had been widely expected, contributed to India's downward drift. According to data supplied by the IFC, part of the World Bank, the market registered a 17.6 per cent fall in dollar terms on the month. Mr Nigel Spence, emerging markets equity analyst at Lehman Brothers in London, commented that other negative factors during March included: a series of bomb explosions in Bombay which caused extensive damage to the stock exchange and increased tension between India and Pakistan. Owing to the uncertain political climate there was likely to be a slowdown in foreign cash inflows into the country, he added; expectations of disappointing company results, particularly in the car, steel and cement sectors after the cancellation of a number of infrastructure projects as the government attempts to reduce the budget deficit. Venezuela remained uneasy in an uncertain political environment, and with foreign investors removing capital the central bank was forced to lift interest rates during the month. Towards the end of March, notes Mr Frederico Laffan of Latin American Securities, the market staged a modest recovery on bargain hunting, although volume remained low. Mexico's rally continued, helped by hopes for Nafta approval in the US, and lower inflation and interest rates.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  IFC EMERGING MARKETS INVESTABLE INDICES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  Dollar terms                                No. of    Mar 31    % Change    % Change Market                         stocks      1993 over month on Dec '92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Argentina                      (10)      602.37      +8.3         +3.9 Brazil                         (44)      154.19      +2.8        +23.3 Chile                          (20)      414.98      -3.5         -0.8 Colombia*                       (8)      348.50      -6.1        -18.0 Mexico                         (59)      682.72     +12.6         +1.0 Venezuela**                     (8)      353.76     -25.7        -31.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- East Asia  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Korea***                (130)       94 26      +5.7         -4.0 Philippines                    (11)      153.43      -5.4        +14.9 Taiwan, China****              (76)      104.18      +7.2        +44.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Asia  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- India*****                     (61)       73.38     -17.6        -21.7 Indonesia******                (31)       68.37      +2.6        +16.5 Malaysia                       (61)      170.92      +0.9         +4.5 Pakistan*******                 (8)      193.27      -1.4         -3.5 Thailand                       (52)      229.53      -8.2         -0.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Euro/Mid East  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Greece                         (17)      220.27      -8.0        +12.8 Jordan                          (5)      121.75      +1.7         +4.2 Portugal                       (18)       87.62      +0.2        +13.4 Turkey********                 (31)       90.40      -9.2        +32.1  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                 Local currency terms                                            Mar 31   % Change   % Change Market                                      1993 over month on Dec '92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Argentina                               369,633.07     +8.3       +4.2 Brazil                                 5,277,905.3    +30.0     +153.1 Chile                                       645.64     -4.2       +0.7 Colombia*                                   516.70     -5.0      -15.5 Mexico                                      910.81    +12.8       +0.3 Venezuela**                                 687.99    -24.0      -26.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- East Asia  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Korea***                               98.31     +5.4       -3.4 Philippines                                 184.94     -6.4      +14.4 Taiwan, China****                           101.10     +7.7      +45.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Asia  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- India*****                                   80.65    -15.5      -15.5 Indonesia******                              76.94     +3.3      +17.0 Malaysia                                    163.46     -0.6       +3.6 Pakistan*******                             232.86     +0.2       +0.5 Thailand                                    231.22     -8.3       -0.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Euro/Mid East  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Greece                                      327.51     -9.0      +15.0 Jordan                                      172.57     +1.6       +4.1 Portugal                                     89.37     -1.6      +14.5 Turkey********                              406.74     -3.6      +48.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base date: Dec 1984=100 except those noted which are: (*) Feb 1 1991; (**) Jan 5 1990; (***) Jan 3 1992; (****) Jan 4 1991; (*****) Nov 6 1992; (******) Sep 28 1990; (*******) Mar 1 1991; (********) Aug 4 1989  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

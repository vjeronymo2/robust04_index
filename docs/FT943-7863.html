			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Union International calls in receiver at New Zealand arm Union International, the food processor and distributor controlled by the Vestey family, has called in a receiver for Weddel, its lossmaking New Zealand business, after it was unable to get bankers to support restructuring plans. Up to 3,500 people employed at the company's four plants, were yesterday told they no longer had jobs. The shut down marks one of the biggest loss of jobs in New Zealand's industrial history. It also marks the end of an association between the Vestey family and the New Zealand meat industry that goes back to 1900. Mr Terry Robinson, chief executive, described the move as 'very sad'. He said Union had endeavoured to push through a group restructuring which could have returned the business to profit, but could not get the necessary short-term financing. The New Zealand business had been ring fenced, and its collapse will have no meaningful impact on the parent company. The Weddel group has four large works which slaughtered 10 per cent of the country's sheep and 15 per cent of the beef cattle. It was the fourth biggest meat processor and exporter in the country. Mr Robinson said the company had made a profit of close to NZDollars 20m (Pounds 7.8m) in the year to September 1992, but had since been hit by overcapacity in the industry, and slackening demand from the US. Mr Alan Isaac, the receiver, said Weddel's problems were similar to those of the rest of the industry: too much slaughter capacity for a dwindling amount of stock, too much competition, and adverse exchange rate movements. He said Weddel had secured debt of NZDollars 170m and unsecured creditors, including staff and farmers, who were owed NZDollars 35m. Mr Isaac is also acting as receiver for Fortex, another large meat processor which collapsed five months ago with losses of about NZDollars 160m. A Weddel statement said that every effort had been made to restructure the company. Earlier this year Union abandoned attempts to float part of it through the New Zealand Stock Exchange. Union has had its own financial difficulties, and under a standstill arrangement with its bankers in 1992 it was unable to provide capital for its New Zealand subsidiary. Union's debt peaked at Pounds 420m, but following the agreement with its banks in 1992 it has pursued a policy of asset disposals. In 1993 it sold Pounds 100m of businesses in the UK, Brazil and Australia and at the end of 1993 it had net debt of Pounds 124.6m.</p>

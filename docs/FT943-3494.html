			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Algeria releases leading militants The Algerian government has released the country's top two fundamentalist leaders from prison and put them under house arrest and freed three other other leading Moslem militants in a conciliatory move aimed at defusing growing political tension. The two paramount leaders of the banned opposition Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), Mr Abassi Madani and Mr Ali Benhadj were transferred yesterday from the military prison in Blida, due south of Algiers to a residence where they will remain, for the time being under house arrest. In a further gesture of goodwill, the Algerian head of state, Gen Liamine Zeroual had three prominent members of the FIS ruling council, Mr Noureddine Chigara, Mr Abdelkader Omar and Mr Kamel Guemmazi set free. Gen Zeroual's move comes two weeks after Mr Madani suggested, in a letter to the head of state that the FIS might consider a truce. Gen Mohamed Betchine, secretary general of the presidency and one of General Zeroual's most trusted advisers met the imprisoned FIS leaders on two occasions, in Blida prison, the week before last. The spokesman for the exiled leadership of the FIS, Mr Rabah Kebir, said his party 'was happy about the liberation of our leaders that we consider a positive step but not a sufficient one. All FIS leaders must be set free, notably Mr Abdelkader Hachani, the head of the party's executive at the time of the elections of December 1991. This will allow all conditions necessary for the start of dialogue.' The FIS was outlawed in February 1992 after winning 47.3 per cent of the vote in the first round of Algeria's first ever multi-party elections in December 1991. The conflict which has pitted the military backed government against the supporters of fundamentalist Islam has, according to figures just released by the Algerian presidency cost 10,000 lives and Dollars 2bn worth of damage, most notably to schools, 329 of which have been destroyed. In recent months the US, Italy and Spain have strongly urged Algerian leaders to open a dialogue with those fundamentalists who rejected violence. France's position however has been more ambivalent. While the French foreign minister, Mr Alain Juppe admitted that the 'status quo was untenable' the powerful minister of the interior Mr Charles Pasqua has been vocal in his support for the Algerian regime.</p>

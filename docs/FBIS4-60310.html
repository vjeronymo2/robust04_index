			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Southerners Accuse Jordan of </F> Partiality in Favor of Sanaa"]    [Text] London, Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- An Adeni citizen  who did not wish to be named has stated that the Jordanian  authorities have turned back a large number of Yemeni  passengers, including many women and children, who arrived in  Amman via YEMDA Airlines from Aden the day before yesterday.  Officials at Queen 'Alya' international airport said that their  decision to deny the Yemeni citizens entry was made "on the  instructions of higher authorities." He said that "that was  clear partiality in favor of Sanaa."    Eyewitnesses at the airport said that the YEMDA office  director confirmed to the Jordanian passport authorities that  the Yemeni nationals had return tickets and had guarantees from  the company for a week's stay in Jordan, but the authorities  rejected that. YEMDA sources in Amman confirmed this and said  that the passengers returned to Aden after being denied access  to the transit area from where they could have continued their  trip to Damascus.    A responsible south Yemeni source has stated that the  Jordanian authorities acted in that way, and also turned back  Colonel Naji 'Ali Naji, director of the Yemeni defense  minister's office and member of the Joint Military Committee who  had arrived in Amman for treatment, but at the same time they  sent six planeloads of medical aid to Sanaa, thereby indicating  alignment with the northern leadership in the current conflict  in Yemen.</p>

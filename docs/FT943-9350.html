			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Emerging Markets While the Brazilian equity market continues to make substantial headway following the introduction of a new currency at the start of July - the third phase of the government's economic stabilisation programme - the attention of many investors has been directed recently to Mexico. Last week, a number of brokers raised the weighting of the market in their asset allocation portfolios to reflect the generally positive attitude towards the forthcoming presidential elections. Salomon Brothers was among those to change its stance, increasing its allocation by 2 percentage points to 40 per cent, and said it expected equities to gain momentum as the August 21 elections approached. 'We continue to believe the elections will be seen as the freest and fairest in Mexico's history, and that post-election disputes will be manageable,' it added.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------         EMERGING MARKETS: IFC WEEKLY INVESTABLE PRICE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                       Dollar terms                  No. of     August 5    % Change    % Change Market           stocks         1994   over week  on Dec '93  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America     (209)       695.47        +8.5        +6.9 Argentina          (25)       910.69        +1.6        -8.4 Brazil             (57)       340.79       +17.1       +46.4 Chile              (25)       670.14        +4.7       +21.4 Colombia1          (11)       968.40        +0.7       +50.2 Mexico             (68)       947.41        +6.9        -5.9 Peru2              (11)       144.88        +6.0       +19.8 Venezuela3         (12)       480.67        +3.7       -18.8 Asia              (557)       264.66        +5.4        -9.1 China4             (18)       102.04        +5.5       -31.6 South Korea5      (156)       128.02        +0.7        +8.3 Philippines        (18)       298.13        +3.9       -12.4 Taiwan, China6     (90)       156.10        +1.9       +15.5 India7             (76)       136.86        +2.2       +17.5 Indonesia8         (37)       102.09        +6.8       -18.1 Malaysia          (105)       295.16        +7.4       -12.9 Pakistan9          (15)       391.01        +0.5        +0.8 Sri Lanka10         (5)       181.17        -0.2        +2.2 Thailand           (55)       405.27        +3.8       -15.1 Euro/Mid East     (125)       118.64        +3.8       -29.9 Greece             (25)       233.85        +8.2        +2.7 Hungary11           (5)       181.20        -3.3        +8.7 Jordan             (13)       163.05        +0.1        -1.5 Poland12           (12)       722.24        +8.2       -11.7 Portugal           (25)       124.52        +7.0        +9.4 Turkey13           (40)       110.67        -0.2       -47.9 Zimbabwe            (5)       246.19        +2.1       +21.8 Composite         (891)       343.40        +6.7        -3.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Local currency terms                          August 5   % Change   % Change Market                  1994 over    week on    Dec '93  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina              558,821.19       +1.6       -8.4 Brazil              1,162,367,043       +6.8   +1,044.4 Chile                    1,129.04       +4.1      +18.4 Colombia1                1,397.03       +0.5      +50.7 Mexico                   1,380.38       +6.2       +2.3 Peru2                      194.47       +6.0      +22.3 Venezuela3               1,878.48       +3.7      +32.2 Asia China4                     111.01       +5.4      -32.4 South Korea5               135.05       +0.7       +7.6 Philippines                377.77       +5.5      -14.9 Taiwan, China6             155.53       +1.5      +16.2 India7                     151.35       +2.2      +17.5 Indonesia8                 120.03       +6.6      -15.7 Malaysia                   280.16       +6.5      -16.9 Pakistan9                  542.13       +0.5       +2.6 Sri Lanka10                194.96       +0.7       +2.1 Thailand                   401.81       +3.6      -16.8 Euro/Mid East Greece                     377.87       +7.8       -1.7 Hungary11                  239.57       +4.3      +18.7 Jordan                     233.09       -0.1       -2.6 Poland12                 1,043.55       +8.8       -5.5 Portugal                   137.41       +6.6       -0.5 Turkey13                 1,624.32       +0.4      -11.7 Zimbabwe14                 292.94       +2.3      +37.1 Composite  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Indices are calculated at end-week, and weekly changes are percentage movement from the previous Friday.

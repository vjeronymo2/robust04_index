			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3,000 IN JORDAN RAIL AGAINST WEST  </P> <P> Muslim fundamentalists trampled and burned American, British and Israeli flags  at a rally in Jordan on Sunday to show anger at Western military action in the  Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> "Oh America, assemble your troops, tomorrow the soldiers of truth will crush  you," chanted a mainly Palestinian crowd of 3,000 in the industrial town of  Ruseifa, just outside Amman.  </P> <P> Youths masked with checkered head cloths doused the flags with gasoline and set  them on fire. The crowd surged forward, ripping at the blazing fragments of  cloth.  </P> <P> It was the latest in a series of rallies and protests in Jordan, where  anti-Western feelings have exploded since U.S.-led forces arrived in Saudi  Arabia to defend it against Iraq.  </P> <P> The Muslim Brotherhood, which organized the Ruseifa rally, has not  traditionally supported Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, who has crushed  militant Shiite Muslim groups in Iraq.  </P> <P> "Maybe Saddam has changed. We hope he is a good Muslim now," said Omar Obeid, a  Brotherhood supporter in the crowd.  </P></p>

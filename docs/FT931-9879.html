			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Survival strategy - Political Notebook There are dark mutterings again on the Tory backbenches. It is not so much panic, more a mood of resigned desperation. Each week, it seems, brings a fresh crisis, each crisis a fresh U-turn. The latest furore over Maastricht is symptomatic. Nothing new has happened. It has been apparent for months that the eventual vote on Labour's amendment to remove the British opt-out from the social chapter would create an unholy alliance to threaten the government's slim majority. Lord Tebbit, Mr John Smith and Mr Paddy Ashdown have added nothing to their previously stated positions. The latter two insist that the treaty would survive the amendment. Lord Tebbit and his faithful band of Euro-sceptics in the House of Commons are in ironic agreement with the Foreign Office that insertion of the social chapter would wreck the legislation. The vote is at least four - and possibly as many as eight - weeks away. A defeat would be a serious blow for Mr John Major. But it would be followed by a vote of confidence. The prime minister would win. The amendment could then be removed again at the bill's report stage. That the issue has caught alight so far in advance of its denouement simply underscores the brittle confidence of the government and its supporters. When there is no immediate crisis in sight they go in search of one. But it is not quite so hard to understand the deeper undercurrents of anxiety among Tory MPs. The crumbling of confidence in the pound on financial markets has provided an awkward reminder that sterling crises also happen outside the exchange rate mechanism. Economic recovery seems as elusive as ever. The chancellor is threatening to increase taxes. Unemployment is heading above 3m. Friends in the City warn that inflation might soon be a problem. The backbenchers have no simple or coherent remedy of their own. His intensive pre-Budget consultations have left Mr Norman Lamont's ears ringing with confusion. Some want immediate tax increases - via the extension of value added tax - to halt the haemorrhaging in government finances. Others insist that any significant rise in taxation eventually would send Mr Major the way of Mr George Bush. The favoured compromise is the announcement in March of modest tax increases to take effect in December. In truth, the average Tory MP is as uncertain as the average cabinet minister about how best to nurture sustained recovery. As Mr Lamont discovered to his cost, in such febrile times even a cut in interest rates can be mis-interpreted. The reflex response of some has been to demand that Mr Major reshuffle his ministerial team - as if a few new faces around the cabinet table would somehow calm the markets and fill the high streets. No matter that the ministerial tier below the cabinet is hardly brimming with talent. Others have resorted to the traditional call for the government to sharpen its presentation. Somehow a few more speeches, a few appearances on the evening news programmes should persuade the nation - and its supporters - that the government is not drifting on to the rocks. Mr Major does have a strategy. It is straightforward and entirely rational. But it is hardly one he can shout from the rooftops. The prime minister intends that he and his government should survive the next six months. The prevailing assumption in the cabinet is that until recovery is visible and until the the party has stopped tearing itself apart over Europe, the government should be content to avoid defeats at Westminster. It will fudge, compromise and where necessary perform indelicate U-turns to preserve its 21-seat majority in a fractious House of Commons. Radical policies can wait until the government regains its grip. Evidence of the strategy was provided by decision to defer closure of one of the Royal Navy's dockyards. It will be apparent again when Mrs Virginia Bottomley announces that her plans to rationalise London's hospitals will be the subject of further prolonged consultation. It is clear in the determination of senior ministers to avoid if at all possible the need for new legislation to rescue the coal industry. It is infecting ministerial deliberations on the future shape of the police force and on measures to help the unemployed. Senior ministers are acutely aware that the strategy carries a price. They will be accused of fudge and mudge, of indecision and lack of direction. But they will survive to see better days. To adapt a phrase from the playground: sticks and stones may break my bones but headlines will never hurt me.</p>

			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Rise forecast for construction jobs Employment in the construction industry will rise by 7,000 next year, ending four years of steep decline, says a forecast by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. However, RICS estimates that employment in the industry is likely to fall by a further 37,000 to 1.37m this year, a figure which includes self-employed builders but not professionals such as architects and surveyors. About 500,000 construction jobs have been shed since 1989. RICS also forecast that 1996 would see net job creation of only 3,000 even though the extension of London Underground's Jubilee Line will alone create 8,000 jobs in 1995 and 7,000 in 1996.</p>

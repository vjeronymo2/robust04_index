			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOO LATE, ANGELS RESEMBLE A CONTENDER  </P> <P> This was how it was supposed to be: the Angels would get strong efforts from  their starting pitchers, the occasional opportunistic hit and enough home runs  to make them a factor in the American League West race.  </P> <P> They're doing all that, except the race is for third place.  </P> <P> Capitalizing on two debatable intentional walks ordered by Texas Manager Bobby  Valentine in the seventh inning, the Angels scored seven times to break open a  close game and rout the Rangers, 9-2, Wednesday night.  </P> <P> Lance Parrish's three-run home run, a 393-foot drive to right-center that was  his 21st of the season, highlighted an inning in which the Angels sent 11  batters to the plate and routed John Barfield (3-2), who had relieved Kevin  Brown.  </P> <P> Jim Abbott (9-12) allowed eight hits over 7 1/3 innings and struck out a  season-high seven as the Angels won their fifth consecutive game and moved  within a half-game of the third-place Rangers. In sweeping Texas for the first  time since June 22-24, 1987 -- and the first at Anaheim Stadium since June  16-18, 1986 -- the Angels climbed above .500 (66-65) for the first time since  June 29.  </P> <P> Valentine prolonged the Angels' seventh-inning spree by intentionally walking  Dick Schofield, a .229 hitter, to match the left-handed Barfield against the  left-handed hitting Luis Polonia with Jack Howell on second. That backfired  when Polonia singled to center, scoring Howell. Center fielder Gary Pettis'  throw home was dropped by catcher Mike Stanley, and Schofield took third and  Polonia second on the play.  </P> <P> Valentine then walked switch-hitter Devon White -- a .257 hitter right-handed  -- to get to Chili Davis, a .265 hitter from the right side. Davis walked on  four pitches, forcing in a run.  </P> <P> Dave Winfield's single off Brad Arnsberg scored two more runs and Parrish  provided the final touch with his home run.  </P> <P> The Angels gave Abbott a run to work with in the third. Johnny Ray led off with  a liner that struck the glove of third baseman Jeff Kunkel and carried into  left field, where it eluded Pete Incaviglia long enough for Ray to scamper to  second. Ray tagged and took third when Schofield lined to right and scored on  Polonia's grounder to second.  </P> <P> Abbott faced the minimum nine batters through the first three innings. He  allowed a leadoff single to Ruben Sierra in the second, but Sierra was erased  in a double play initiated by Abbott. He stabbed Jack Daugherty's comebacker,  whirled and made a throw to second that was slightly wide of the bag. Ray  snared the ball and relayed to first to complete the Angels' major  league-leading 150th double play.  </P> <P> The Angels' offense gave Abbott additional support in the fourth. Davis led off  with a single to right and took second on Lee Stevens' grounder to first. First  baseman Daugherty glanced at second to see if he had a play there, but went for  the sure out at first. That proved important, as Parrish ended an 0-for-6 dry  spell with a single to left-center, scoring Davis. That increased Parrish's  club-leading RBI total to 58.  </P> <P> Incaviglia ended a longer slump in the fifth when he slammed a 1 and 0 pitch  from Abbott off the facing of the right-field seats for his 19th home run of  the season. Incaviglia had been hitless in his previous 16 at-bats and had  three hits in his previous 43 at-bats.  </P> <P> Incaviglia's homer was the first run scored by the Rangers in 15 2/3 innings  against the Angels, since an RBI-single by Jeff Huson with one out in the  seventh inning Monday night. Kirk McCaskill shut the Rangers out Tuesday night.  </P> <P> Abbott got Huson on a called third strike leading off the sixth. Then Pettis  singled, but Abbott induced Kunkel to fly to left and struck out Julio Franco  for his season-best seven strikeouts.  </P> <P> Abbott faced his first real challenge in the seventh, a threat in which he got  little help from the Angels' defense. Sierra singled up the middle and  Incaviglia followed with a blooper to right that fell a few steps in front of a  slow-running Dave Winfield.  </P> <P> Daugherty moved the runners up with a sacrifice played by Abbott, and Mike  Stanley was intentionally walked to create a play at any base. John Russell hit  a hopper to third baseman Howell, who kept the ball in front of him but allowed  it to roll up and off his chest and behind him. When he recovered, his only  play was to step on third to force Incaviglia, and Sierra scored the tying run.  </P></p>

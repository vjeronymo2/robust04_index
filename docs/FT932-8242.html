			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / International Company News: Results contrast at store chains CONTRASTING fortunes in the US retail sector were evident yesterday, when Dayton Hudson and JC Penney, two of the nation's largest store chains, unveiled first-quarter results. JC Penney, the Texas-based department store group, enjoyed a fairly strong three-month period to May 1. Total sales rose by 4.5 per cent, to Dollars 3.96bn, and with selling costs remaining static and interest charges falling slightly, net profits before extraordinary items and accounting-related items, stood at Dollars 172m, compared with Dollars 136m a year earlier. JC Penney said its gross margin fell from 34.1 per cent to 33.9 per cent, as a result of its lower pricing strategy. But selling, general and administrative expenses also fell, to 30 per cent of retail sales, against 31.5 per cent a year earlier. After extraordinary items and the accounting related changes, net profits reached Dollars 206m. Earnings per share, on the same basis, stood at 78 cents, against 52 cents. The company attributed the first-quarter results to its pricing strategies, and said that it was still looking to strengthen stock management and supplier relationships. Mr William Howell, chairman, also indicated that the group was exploring possibilities in the 'private brand' area. Dayton Hudson, by contrast, saw after-tax profits dip to Dollars 30m in the same three-month period, after a one-off Dollars 3m charge, compared with Dollars 35m profits last time. Sales reached Dollars 4.04bn, compared with Dollars 3.72bn. 'We have been disappointed by our sales results since the middle of February,' commented Mr Kenneth Macke, chairman. 'Consumers are very cautious. Part of that is due to pervasive economic concerns, such as uncertainties about job security, tax increases and the cost of health care reform.' He added that the problems had been particularly noticeable at Mervyn's, the middle-market department store chain. Operating profits fell in this division due to lower-than-expected sales - in turn, blamed partly on insufficient promotional activity. Gross margins at the department store division, which takes in Marshall Field's, were flat.</p>

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Major heading for India MR JOHN MAJOR, the British prime minister, leaves for India today planning to stress the importance of further economic reform there if British investment is to expand. Whitehall officials were playing down the likelihood of deals being announced during the prime minister's trip. But he will be accompanied by 17 businessmen from some of Britain's largest companies, including British Aerospace which is hoping for progress on a contract to sell Hawk trainer jets to the Indian air force. Britain is the largest foreign investor in India. Mr Major will be guest of honour at India's republic day celebrations on Tuesday.</p>

			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A VALLEY GIRL WHO BEAT NOVEL ODDS  </P> <P> Established novelist Mary Gordon was a guest on the show. So was critic and  biographer James Atlas. Then there was first-time novelist Jane Vandenburgh.  </P> <P> "I pronounced myself a Valley girl," Vandenburgh says with a grin.  </P> <P> Vandenburgh, who grew up in Northridge, is talking about her performance the  week before on the very highbrow PBS series, "Bookmark." She was there plugging  her first novel, "Failure to Zigzag" (North Point Press: $16.95), a darkly  funny mother-daughter story set in Southern California in the late '50s and  early '60s.  </P> <P> The appearance on the show, which is hosted by literary heavyweight Lewis  Lapham and is taped in New York, was heady stuff for an author whose first  novel about Southern California was rejected by every publisher she approached  and whose book was finally, miraculously plucked from a slush pile of  unsolicited manuscripts by an editor who not only looked at it, but liked it.  </P> <P> Vandenburgh, who lives now in Oakland, is huddled over breakfast at the Hyatt  Hotel at the airport. She's laughing about the "Valley girl" crack and it's not  just because of the show's staid tone. The whole notion is absurd. She's 40,  married to a professor who teaches James Joyce at San Francisco State, where  Jane Vandenburgh earned a master's in creative writing, and has two children,  Noah, 8, and Eva, 4.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Three Years of Mailings  </P> <P> After five years at the typewriter, between editing jobs and raising her  children, Vandenburgh had spent another three years sending her manuscript to  New York publishers and agents. Although she'd once worked as an editor at  Chronicle Books and had contacts in publishing, when it came time to show  agents her novel she decided not to use an agent in her approaches to  publishers. "I wanted someone to take it for the love of the book."  </P> <P> A commendable idea, but it didn't work. "I had 23 rejections of this novel,"  Vandenburgh says, shaking her head. Publishers weren't interested because she  didn't have an agent and only two published short stories to her credit. Agents  weren't interested because she was an unknown writer.  </P> <P> But they were also turned off by Vandenburgh's unsentimental treatment of her  schizophrenic mother character, Katrinka. "They'd say, 'not for us,' " recalls  Vandenburgh, who admits she finds her character "vulgar" and a terrible mother.  </P> <P> Finally, Vandenburgh submitted the manuscript to North Point, the prestigious  small literary press in Berkeley. And though it languished there in the pile  for six months, when editor Kate Moses picked it out and read it she  immediately fell in love with it.  </P> <P> Vandenburgh figures the chances of her manuscript being accepted there were "1  in 32,000." And the fact that it was still seems to astound her. "I don't  believe in God, but I do believe in North Point."  </P> <P> It's a version that Lisa Ross, subsidiary rights director at North Point, does  not dispute. "What is clear about this book is it seems somehow blessed, in  that it's beating the odds in publishing. The odds for an unagented manuscript  to be read and accepted are so extraordinarily low that just its publication is  a small miracle.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Strong Characters  </P> <P> "It actually became a cause celebre in-house," Ross says. "The characters are  so strong and the language is so fun and unusual, everyone was speaking like  Katrinka. It was a book that everybody felt special about."  </P> <P> Though it's too soon to tell, Ross believes the novel has the potential to be a  strong seller. Avon has already set a floor for the paperback rights at  $30,000, and 12 houses are in the bidding. Beyond that, "it's being very  well-reviewed," Ross says. "Jane is appearing on 'Bookmark,' and for them to  focus on a first novel is very unusual. Also, there's a lot of movie interest.  We have two option offers, and I think we'll be receiving more. It's very much  a word-of-mouth book as well. People read it and are so enthusiastic they tell  all their friends about it. So that's a good sign for the book as well."  </P> <P> For her part, Vandenburgh feels vindicated -- by the publication, some  favorable reviews, a positive response from readers, the movie offers. (Bette  Midler is interested, but Vandenburgh would like to see Tracey Ullman play  Katrinka.)  </P> <P> "People seem to like Katrinka," she says, sounding somewhat surprised. "They  don't say, she's a bad woman, a bad mother. I think we all have our  Katrinka-esque days, especially those of us who are mothers and aspire to some  kind of artistic career."  </P> <P> If you crossed Lucy Ricardo with Blanche Dubois, she'd come out acting pretty  much like Katrinka. She's an alcoholic and a ventriloquist, and she talks  loudly in public and calls her auditory hallucinations "Space Radio." Her idea  of cuisine is a loaf of French bread stuffed with an ear of corn and drowned in  canned peaches or a mayonnaise and olive sandwich. Her idea of housework is to  pile all the laundry in the sink and let it ferment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Survival Attempts  </P> <P> The story basically revolves around her daughter Charlotte's efforts to survive  this. And, for that matter, to survive the repressive rantings of her equally  nutty maternal grandparents, Lionel and Winnie, with whom she lives when  Katrinka's locked up in Camarillo State Hospital.  </P> <P> Vandenburgh's own childhood was more like "Father Knows Best" meets "The Brady  Bunch." A fourth-generation Californian, and one of eight children, Vandenburgh  comes from a family of "staid, pretentious Republicans." (Who aren't all that  different from her characters Winnie and Lionel, she notes wryly.) Her mother  was a housewife, her father an executive with Lockheed, and most of her  relatives lived in Orange, Glendale and Redondo Beach -- places that also  figure prominently in her book.  </P> <P> </P> <P> From Vivid Memories  </P> <P> Her vivid memories of growing up here and her interest in California history  led her to write about Southern California. Lionel, for instance, a former  successful banker who lost everything in the '29 crash, is obsessed with Bank  of America founder A. P. Giannini. He lies on the couch all day, reading and  rereading the same Charles Dickens books, going to the phone "believing it  might be some powerful banker -- A. P. Giannini? . . . who was calling him  home."  </P> <P> There's also a strong indication that this rock-ribbed Republican, this  teetotaler who harangues Charlotte about the dangers of "drink," may be a child  molester. It's all part of Vandenburgh's take on sinister California. "I  believe a lot of scoundrels ended up here," she says, "people who were far  removed from the structures of a more extended family. Did Katrinka really go  to bed with her father? I don't know. But I think that typically does happen  when the family is shorn away. Lionel and Winnie don't work, they don't go out,  so there's no one to make them face up to what they're doing."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Interest in Ventriloquism  </P> <P> Katrinka did not arise out of Vandenburgh's own experience, but from an  interest in writing about a ventriloquist. But she was also inspired by her  view of the "downside" of Lucy Ricardo.  </P> <P> Of Lucy and similar Lucille Ball roles, Vandenburgh recalls, "We were supposed  to think she was very funny. I remember sitting in the theater as a kid, seeing  her in this movie 'The Long Long Trailer,' with this trailer swinging out all  over the road, and it was awful. It was sort of a metaphor for housekeeping,  trying to be the good 1950s housewife."  </P> <P> A more recent inspiration, she said, is all the adults her age who constantly  complain about their parents. Practically everyone in Berkeley is in either AA  or Al-Anon, she groans, and it's "all this sort of whining," and, taking the  line from a Woody Allen movie, she'd like to tell them "Just grow up!" That's  one reason she wanted to write about schizophrenia: to show the "monumental  hurdles in each child's life."  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, "dealing with these characters" made it a tough book to  write, "even though I have a feeling Charlotte is going to make it."  </P> <P> Vandenburgh strongly believed in Katrinka when everyone else didn't. Everyone,  that is, except her husband, who thought the book was hilarious, and a friend  who'd take her out to lunch every time she rewrote the book. And it was that  faith that kept her going.  </P> <P> Vandenburgh has completed the second draft of her second novel called "The  Physics of Sunset." It's about an architect in Berkeley. In the meantime, she's  savoring the success of Katrinka.  </P> <P> "I'm so delighted people think this comic monster is funny. It makes me feel  other people out there have my same sick sense of humor."  </P></p>

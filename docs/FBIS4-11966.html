			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Tzvi Bar'el: "Shattering Every Myth"] </F>   [Text] There are three ways in which U.S. national  security advisers can influence the state of affairs. One, to  set up a subversive body inside the administration that will  secretly carry out a policy the administration publicly opposes,  as John Poindexter did in the Irangate affair under President  Reagan. Second, to have frightful rows with the secretary of  state, as Zbigniew Brzezinski did with Cyrus Vance, and the  third, to write articles in the daily or professional press,  hoping the White House will read them more earnestly than  internal memorandums.    Anthony Lake, President Clinton's new national security  adviser, chose the third way. In an article published in  FOREIGN AFFAIRS magazine, he proposes -- as a sequel to his  assistant Martin Indyk's article -- a dual containment policy.  In practical terms, this policy means that instead of pitting  Iran against Iraq and vice versa, a pro-Western alliance would  be formed, comprising Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Israel, and  possibly Syria, too. The alliance would be a security belt  against the influence of reactionary countries.    The unveiling of the new strategy causes concern. The  strategy is slightly reminiscent of Reagan's caricature world  map. In that map, the world was divided into four parts: the  Soviet Union and the Evil Empire; Europeans and those who do not  speak our language; we, the Americans, who are the greatest; and  an empty area comprised mostly of Africa. The world is simple.  We will curb and eradicate the evil nations and pay off the  good ones. This is what Lake is also proposing. Except that  his plan, which looks enticing on paper, is potentially as  dangerous as a telephone diagnosis. The United States has never  clearly defined the term reactionary country. Is Saudi Arabia,  which cuts off thieves' hands, reactionary, or is it perhaps a  progressive state because it takes pains to restrain elements  more reactionary than herself? Is Turkey a progressive state  only because it is a NATO member, or is it backward because it  has been massacring the Kurdish minority?    Another vague definition pertains to the term alliance. Does  Lake envision a NATO-like alliance in the Middle East, in which  Turkey is member but Iran is not, although the two share the  same interest in restraining the Kurds and both have announced  their objection to carving up Iraq? If Lake hopes that such an  alliance will offset the Hizballah control of Lebanon, what will  block radical Islam in Egypt, Algeria, and Sudan? And what is  Israel's contribution to the war against the Islam? An even  greater danger is the possibility that establishing one  pro-Western pact will immediately generate another composed of  Iran and Iraq, Libya and India, Afghanistan and the rich Islamic  central-Asian states of Indonesia an Malaysia. The latter  alliance may engage the endorsement of China and perhaps the  support of Japan, currently in a tacit economic war with the  United States.    What price is the United States ready to pay today for  preventing the creation of such an alliance? Is the blocking of  Hizballah worth the loss of thousands of American jobs resulting  from the counter-alliance's decision to boycott one single  American product? The national security adviser would have done  well to look up the origin of the term containment, which was  invented by George Keenan, who was the U.S. ambassador to the  Soviet Union 45 years ago. Writing in -- what a surprise --  FOREIGN AFFAIRS -- in 1947, he suggested applying a containment  policy to Stalin's USSR, but in his memoirs written twenty years  later, he warned that the containment policy should not  constitute a sequel to the status quo, but rather be a bridging  policy toward an era in which the United States and the USSR  would be able to hold an effective dialogue on how to avoid the  perils of status quo. "And if the plan fails," Keenan wrote,  "it will happen because of our government's inability to spot  the emerging opportunities to establish an effective political  dialogue, and because of its excessive preoccupation with the  military aspects of the conflict."    The Arab alliance that will constitute the double  containment  proposed by Lake is none other but a semantic description of the  current status quo. Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, and  certainly Israel are considered pro-American countries. Iraq is  sealed off by an international embargo anyway, and Iran is  already subject to every possible American sanction, excluding a  military attack. What additional containment can the United  States expect? Some observers believe there is even now an  opportunity to move on to the post-containment stage, to a slow  resumption of relations with Iran and the gradual lifting of  sanctions on Iraq.    There are indications that at least Iran is interested in  resuming the ties with the United States, provided the latter  stops meddling in its domestic affairs. Would it not be better  if the national security adviser stopped defining existing  situations and instead, probed the situation to verify that the  United States was not missing another opportunity?</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Citizen Watch edges ahead COST CUTTING and aggressive marketing in new business sectors helped Citizen Watch to a slight rise in pre-tax profits for the year to end-March in spite of sluggish domestic demand and depressed international markets. Citizen reported a 0.3 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Y16.9bn (Dollars 152.3m) on a 6.9 per cent rise in sales to Y252.4bn. The company said it had faced a harsh environment with cuts in corporate capital investment in Japan, which affected Citizen's industrial machinery business, along with sluggish personal consumption and stagnant overseas markets. Citizen warned that the recent rapid appreciation of the yen and the prospect of growing frictions with its trade partners cast a shadow over the outlook for the coming year. Wrist watch production rose by 14.9 per cent to 186.7m watches. However, intensifying price competition for luxury watches reduced Citizen's profit margins, offsetting gains on sales of cheaper products, including those made under licence to other companies. Worldwide wristwatch sales fell by 2.5 per cent to Y119.4bn. Citizen said it was mainly cutting costs by transferring wristwatch production to lower cost sites elsewhere in Asia. The sharp fall in Japanese corporate investment cut sales of industrial machinery by 35 per cent to Y17.1bn. However, sales of notebook personal computers were strengthened by Citizen's strong position in miniaturisation technology. This pushed up sales of information equipment and parts by 38.6 per cent to Y74.5bn. Sales of liquid crystal display units and portable televisions grew, taking the company's sales of electronic equipment to Y35.5bn, up 30.2 per cent from the year before. Sales of electronic and information equipment made up 43 per cent of Citizen's sales last year, compared to 33 per cent in the previous year. Net income per share was 14.9 per cent up at Y30.65. The final dividend was increased by Y1 to Y5, lifting the full dividend to from Y8 to Y9.</p>

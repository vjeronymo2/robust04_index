			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: London The central event of the week for the gilts market will be Wednesday's monthly meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. Some analysts think the meeting will lead to a further rise in base rates. 'The evidence of continued price pressures, falling capacity and no clear slowdown in growth will be sufficient to prompt the governor to request a further tightening of policy,' believes Mr James Barty, senior UK economist at Morgan Grenfell. He predicts the meeting will result in base rates rising to 6 per cent, a quarter of a percentage point increase. But Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, thinks the chancellor will resist a rate rise. He believes Mr Clarke will not want to dent consumer confidence ahead of the vital Christmas shopping season, nor will he want to antagonise voters before what is likely to be a fairly austere Budget. Either way, the market is likely to be jittery all week, especially as September's base rate rise was delayed until the Monday after the monthly meeting. The Bank's quarterly inflationary report, published on Tuesday, may give some clues as to the governor's thinking; his recent remarks have suggested bond markets are over-stating the inflationary threat.</p>

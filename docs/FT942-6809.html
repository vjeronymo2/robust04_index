			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Italy set for clash with EU over steel The European Commission is heading for a confrontation with the new Italian government over subsidies paid to steel producers. Mr Karel Van Miert, commissioner for competition, said yesterday he had asked his staff to prepare proceedings against the Italians, following the collapse of the European Union's steel rescue plan last week. Government aid paid to steel mills in the northern Brescia region in return for capacity cuts was, until last week, permitted under the rescue plan. Since the plan's collapse, the subsidies have fallen foul of the Commission's rules on state subsidies. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Van Miert said he would play no part in reviving the rescue plan which collapsed after Brussels rejected his proposals for capacity cuts. 'I have a minimum of dignity,' said Mr Van Miert. 'I am not coming back. This is the end.' The Commission's action will present Mr Vito Gnutti, Italy's new industry minister, with a difficult challenge. It may also evoke the wrath of Italy's Euro-sceptics, who are urging the new government to take a tougher line with Brussels. Mr Van Miert's determination to follow normal Commission procedure, in spite of protests that the plan could yet be rescued, will also cause consternation in the steel industry. The industry was relying on Brussels to salvage the plan, launched 18 months ago to reduce overcapacity in the recession-torn sector. Under the plan Italy would have restructured its steel sector in return for production cuts. But a proposal to cut capacity at mills in Brescia in return for subsidies was rejected last week when commissioners questioned the legality of the payments. Mr Van Miert said there were now no viable alternatives to achieving the plan's minimum 19m tonnes of capacity cuts. One option would be to proceed under article 95 of the European coal and steel treaty which allows state subsidies to be paid to companies, but only after unanimous consent from the Council of Ministers. Mr Van Miert said that procedure would delay action for so long that it would amount, in effect, to the plan's collapse. The new cabinet of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi yesterday passed a series of decrees to boost employment and pull Italy out of its worst economic recession since the second world war, Reuter reports from Rome. The media tycoon's free-market government set aside some L500bn (Pounds 209m) to boost youth employment over the next three years and help business in the building sector which has been ravaged by two years of corruption scandals. Over 150,000 construction jobs have been lost in the past two years.</p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHEA &amp; GOULD TO LEAVE L.A. OVER PROFIT DISPUTE  </P> <P> Shea &amp; Gould, an old-line New York-based law firm, confirmed Tuesday that  it is shutting its Los Angeles branch office after 3 1/2 years because of  dissension over the way profits were divided with the home office in New York.  </P> <P> "Some of our partners were very unhappy," said Lessing E. Gold, managing  partner of Shea &amp; Gould in Los Angeles. "The executive board (in New York)  decided they should have a greater share of the profits."  </P> <P> Of the 70 lawyers in the Los Angeles branch of New York-based Shea &amp; Gould,  18 have already said they plan to leave the firm by the end of this month to  open a Los Angeles office for Myerson &amp; Kuhn.  </P> <P> The remaining 52 lawyers will have four months to consider their options while  the Los Angeles office of Shea &amp; Gould winds down its affairs, Gold said.  </P> <P> "We really haven't decided whether we are going to make associations" with  other firms, said Gold. "We are just going to phase out and consider the  options."  </P> <P> A last-ditch effort to work out the dispute failed last month when Gold and six  other Los Angeles partners met with two executive committee members from New  York. The lawyers from Los Angeles told their New York colleagues that they  were unhappy they were not represented on the firm's executive committee and  dissatisfied with the way profits were distributed.  </P> <P> Shea &amp; Gould, which has a total of 380 lawyers, opened its Los Angeles  office by acquiring the Los Angeles firm of Pacht, Ross, Warne, Bernhardt &amp;  Sears.  </P></p>

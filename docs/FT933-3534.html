			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Serbs and Croats in renewed clashes REBEL Serb forces in Croatia yesterday launched heavy artillery attacks on the Croat town of Karlovac, fuelling fears that fighting could escalate in the Serb-controlled Krajina region of Croatia. The rocket and artillery attacks, 50km south west of the Croat capital, Zagreb, came as rebel Serb forces threatened to launch an all-out assault in response to a Croat offensive in Krajina last week. UN officials in Zagreb yesterday confirmed that heavy artillery attacks were continuing by both sides across Krajina, leaving the area more tense than at any time since the ceasefire agreed by the rebel Serbs and Croat at the beginning of 1992. Mr Cedric Thornberry, UN special envoy in Yugoslavia, yesterday strongly condemned the attacks and appealed to both sides to show restraint. Some 6,000 rocket and artillery strikes on Croatian territory had been recorded since the latest outbreak of fighting in Krajina - a figure which is far heavier than the current level of fighting in Bosnia, UN officials said. Meanwhile, in another sign of the pressures now mounting on the Croat leadership, the Croatian president, Mr Franjo Tudjman, is to meet his Bosnian counterpart, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, today in Geneva to discuss access to the sea for the Moslem republic proposed in the carve-up of Bosnia. The Bosnian Croats' refusal to concede Mr Izetbegovic's demand for territory extending to the Adriatic sea was a prime cause of the breakdown of the Bosnian peace talks a fortnight ago. The meeting comes as the 30-strong steering committee for the international conference on former Yugoslavia holds its own discussions in Geneva on the state of the Bosnian negotiations, and separate mediation efforts between the Croatian government and rebel Serbs in Croatia.</p>

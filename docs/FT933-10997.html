			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Massive ERM intervention THE EUROPEAN exchange rate mechanism appeared to be on the brink of collapse yesterday after massive intervention from 6 ERM central banks failed to keep the French franc above its floor in the monetary system, writes James Blitz. Yesterday's currency intervention by the Bundesbank appeared to be in the order of DM60bn, one of the largest operations conducted by a central bank in a single day of trading. One Bundesbank council member, Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, may also have helped to support the franc by saying that German call money could fall through its discount rate. But at the end of what was probably the most hectic session of ERM trading ever, three currencies - the French franc, Belgian franc and Danish krone - were on their ERM floors. After ERM trading closed, central banks did not support these currencies and the French franc traded below its ERM floor, coming as low as FFr3.4330 to the D-Mark. There were strong indications last night that a meeting of the EC Monetary Committee was being convened, but these could not be confirmed. At the start of European trading yesterday, the French franc was hovering above the FFr3.4180 level which the Bank of France had pledged to defend at the end of last week. But, at about 0900 GMT yesterday, the French authorities appear to have allowed the franc to fall to its ERM floor of FFr3.4305. One dealer suggested that the announcement by Mr George Soros, the hedge fund player, may have coincided with a wave of speculation by more short term players. But, by allowing the franc to fall to its floor in the system, France's tactic may have been to put the onus on the Bundesbank to support the franc, which it is obliged to do under ERM rules. 'The French have been very clever,' said one analyst. 'They are effectively saying to the Bundesbank that the only way the system can be saved is by German intervention or a cut in German interest rates.' However, with the dollar closing last night at DM1.7405, up nearly a pfennig on the day, the prospects for a cut were minimal. There were strong suggestions last night that ERM members could contemplate a widening of the bands for the core currencies this weekend, broadening the current permitted fluctuation of 2.25 per cent to perhaps 6 per cent. But Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief currency strategist at Citibank, said this would not be credible in the long term. 'The move would not allow France to cut interest rates, which is the key to this crisis,' he said.</p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Engineers urge better technology teaching AN 'EIGHT-POINT plan' to promote technology teaching in schools was put forward yesterday by the Engineering Council. The plan calls for a practical technology curriculum, based on the design and manufacture of products and systems. It is written by Professor Alan Smithers and Dr Pamela Robinson of Manchester University's education department. They say technology is poorly taught in schools in spite of its inclusion as a core subject in the national curriculum. It is mainly concerned with generalised problem solving without specific knowledge or practical application. 'Technology lacks an identity in the national curriculum,' they say. 'But Britain is the first country to make technology part of the compulsory curriculum for all pupils aged five to 16 . . . and some false starts are perhaps inevitable.' The report points to the difficulty experienced in devising suitable technology assignments as part of the compulsory tests being introduced for 14-year-olds. Mr Denis Filer, director general of the Engineering Council, told a press conference that the plan had to be implemented if school technology 'is to be given credibility and respect among the community at large and with industry'.

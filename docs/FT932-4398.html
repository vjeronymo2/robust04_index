			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / International Company News: Winterthur chief sees recovery in profits WINTERTHUR Insurance, Switzerland's third largest insurance group, is looking for a profit recovery this year after last year's result was hit by several exceptional costs. 'It looks like 1993 will have improved results,' Mr Peter Spalti, the chief executive, said at a press conference in Winterthur. Net income in 1992 fell 6 per cent to SFr247m (Dollars 176.4m) because of write-downs of its investments in Norwich-Winterthur Re and Hypobank, the latter sold to Swiss Bank Corporation in January. Mr Spalti said the group had been hit by natural catastrophes last year, with its reinsurance business losing SFr150m. Norwich Winterthur Re had stopped writing new business and Mr Spalti said it would not put further burdens on the group this year. Gross premiums last year grew 6.2 per cent to SFr15.52bn and he said he was looking for further growth of 7 per cent this year. Mr Spalti said it was possible that Winterthur would increase its stake in France's UAP. Winterthur holds a 3 per cent stake in the large French insurance group which the new French government intends to privatise. A decision to raise it would await further progress on a credit business co-operation between the two. Winterthur plans to split its bearer and registered shares on the basis of 5-for-1 and to convert its participation certificates into registered shares. Swissair said the planned merger of its Balair and Cie des Transports Aeriens charter units may be delayed by an objection raised by one of the units' shareholders, Reuter reports from Basle. The link-up was approved by Swissair shareholders at a meeting, the company said. But should the shareholder's objection not be withdrawn, the plan could be delayed. The shareholder has until June 14 to explain a case against the alliance.</p>

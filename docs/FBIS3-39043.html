			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Extreme... Ethnocentrism"] </F>   [Text] The U.S. recognition of the small state of Skopje  with its temporary name, which is expected within the next few  hours, and our country's endorsement of the European Union [EU]  decision on possible air bombings in Bosnia are not offered for  domestic opposition nor for trying to be more nationalist than  the next fellow.    It happens that in both cases, in which we are called upon  to  accept or support decisions unfavorable to our country, the  positions of our political parties are almost identical. No  party and no Greek agrees with the air bombing in Bosnia, which  would bring the disaster of the war to our borders. At the same  time, there is no Greek who is not unhappy with Washington's  decision to proceed with the recognition of the small state that  tries to usurp the name of Macedonia.    This unity of political positions and popular will  represents  at this time our most significant national advantage, which we  ought to utilize and promote and not downgrade or sacrifice on  the altar of petty political expediency and partisan prejudice.    What weight (or rather political responsibility) could be  used now to urge the exercise of a Greek veto in NATO or the  cancellation of an EU decision--even by "utilizing" the Greek  presidency--with regard to the possible bombing of Bosnia? At  the same time, what political seriousness is there in  suggestions for public disapproval and condemnation of  Washington's imminent action as hostile to our country?    Fortunately, the ordinary Greek citizen understands and  realizes the restructuring changes taking place worldwide and  feels particularly lucky because he belongs to the European  family in which nobody--even the strongest partner--can impose  his will unilaterally. In this same family, however, even the  weakest member has the right to demand equality of the  Community's political, social, and economic rights or  achievements and, what is most important, to entrust his  national security to a political solidarity and defense  partnership of the Twelve, things that are safeguarded by  treaties.    In a similar spirit, a certain part of the Greek people have  overcome their past bitterness, which suffered from an  anti-American and anti-NATO syndrome. These people managed to  overcome this position by merely asking themselves "how is it  and why" are Albania, Bulgaria, and Skopje today hotly pursuing  admission to NATO (to refer only to our bordering neighbors who  until very recently belonged to the "enemy" camp)?    Could it be that this simple--but not naive--question should  force the remaining supporters of pure ethnocentrism to ponder  things irrespective of their right-wing or left-wing origin?  This is so because their recommendations finally lead to the  same result: our international isolation and national  weakening....</p>

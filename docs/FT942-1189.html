			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Football club wins seating extension Newcastle United will be the only English Premier League club where some fans will stand on terraces next season. Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, said yesterday that he had given a year's extension to Newcastle United after it 'presented a sufficiently exceptional case'. But he confirmed his decision not to grant extra time to Barnsley, Chelsea, Manchester City, Oldham or Swindon. All premier league and first division clubs were given until this summer to convert their stadiums to all-seater following the 1989 Hillsborough disaster.</p>

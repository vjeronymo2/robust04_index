			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> ADS SPARK RELIGIOUS GROUP BOYCOTT  </P> <P> A religious group today announced a one-year boycott of the Mennen Co. and  Clorox Corp. for advertising on television programs full of "sex, violence and  profanity."  </P> <P> The boycott by Christian Leaders for Responsible Television, or CLeaR-TV, asked  consumers not to buy products such as bleach and deodorant from the two  companies.  </P> <P> The group said it asked more than 500 companies that advertise on network  television not to sponsor certain programs during the "sweeps" period of April  27 through May 24, when the popularity of network programming is gauged.  Results from monitoring in 33 states "showed that Mennen and Clorox ignored  CLeaR-TV's request not to advertise on programs high in incidents of sex,  violence and profanity during the monitoring period," said Billy Melvin,  chairman of the group. Programs that the group found particularly offensive  included "Miami Vice," "Tour of Duty" and "Midnight Caller," Melvin said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat by unidentified </F> correspondent; place and date not given: "We Are Cousins"]    [Text] [FOCUS] The Hebron massacre has weakened the peace  process. Will it survive the crisis?    ['Arafat] The peace process has been interrupted. I would  like to stress that it has been interrupted and not broken off.  We hope that President Clinton will save the situation.    [FOCUS] What measures do you expect Clinton to adopt?    ['Arafat] Clinton should support the resolution on  international presence that we submitted to the United Nations.  It is included in the Declaration of Principles (DOP). The DOP  should be fulfilled in the interest of our people. Clinton must  exert pressure to ensure the disarmament of the Israeli  extremists in the occupied territories. Finally, the Israeli  Government must clarify the role of the army in the massacre.    [FOCUS] Do you believe Rabin when he says that he wants to  clear up the attack?    ['Arafat] I believe that Rabin will take corresponding  measures if Clinton asks him to do so. Otherwise, I would be  skeptical. Rabin must do everything possible to ensure the  security of the Palestinian people.    [FOCUS] Thus, you are not demanding the abandonment of all  settlements?    ['Arafat] We are not demanding heaven on earth. We know  Israel and the Israelis. We are cousins. We know them very  well. There is no doubt that some settlers are fanatical. The  Israeli Government must take measures against them because the  fanatics want to undermine the peace process and to kill  Palestinians.    [FOCUS] How do you assess the chances for peace, leaving the  massacre out of consideration?    ['Arafat] The truth is that the Israelis do not want to  implement the results of the negotiations. Rabin stated:  "'Arafat should sweat." And then the massacre occurred.    [FOCUS] What will now happen?    ['Arafat] If the peace process should be stopped, and if  Israel does not ensure the security of my people, a  Balkanization will take place, and the Middle East will shake.</p>

In fact, a good portion of many artists' time is spent applying  for, and nervously waiting to hear if they have received, grants from such  institutions as the California Arts Council or the Los Angeles Endowment for  the Arts.  </P> <P> With 1990 deadlines for grants looming on the near horizon, a number of  institutions are offering grant workshops and other guidance for artists who  are unfamiliar or seek assistance with the application process.  </P> <P> * The Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department, which administers the L.A.  Endowment, is holding more than a dozen free workshops to help artists of  various disciplines apply for the 1990-91 Cultural Grant Program.

"Students will learn how to write a resume, to shoot slides  and set up career goals. They will bring to class examples of their work, and  we will explore which areas of art are the best for them to pursue." The class  format will include discussions, written assignments and presentations by art  professionals. The enrollment fee for the six-month course, which begins  Wednesday, is $180. The class meets on Wednesdays from 7-10 p.m. and will be  held in Room 108 of the Westwood United Methodist Church, 10497 Wilshire Blvd.  Information: (213) 206-8503.  </P> <P> ARTISTS' STUDIOS: Artists who haven't been able to find appropriate studio  spaces may soon have a new home.

The proposed spaces, which would range from 625 square feet to 2,100  square feet, will have 14-foot ceilings and natural light.  </P> <P> The project, which is being developed by the Public Corporation for the Arts,  the Long Beach Regional Arts Council, the city's Redevelopment Agency and  M.C.&amp; D. Capital Corp., is located in the historic Walker Building, a  four-story structure at 401 Pine Ave. The building was originally designed and  built by Meyer and Holler, architects of the famed Grauman's Chinese Theater in  Hollywood.  </P> <P> For an application or further information, call (213) 499-7777 or (213)  590-9559.  </P></p>

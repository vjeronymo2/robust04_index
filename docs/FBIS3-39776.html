Demirel said:  This is a last chance for international organizations. If they  do not keep to their word, they will be ruined and no one will  ever believe them again.    Demirel replied to reporters' questions at Cankaya Mansion  today. Recalling Democracy Party leader Hatip Dicle's  statements in connection with the terrorist incident in Tuzla, a  reporter asked Demirel whether this will threaten elections in  the southeast. Demirel replied that there are no problems with  regard to election security. Noting that five innocent youths  were killed in Tuzla, Demirel remarked that no one can qualify  this as normal. He said: Those who encourage bloodshed will  drown in blood. The bloodshed must stop. If that statement is  correct, I would greatly regret it.</p>

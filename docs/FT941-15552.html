			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / People: Non-executive directors Lionel Stammers, who resigned from BTR last month, is joining the board of TOMKINS, another acquisitive conglomerate. Stammers, 60, is one of three non-executives joining a boardroom which has traditionally been dominated by executive directors. Apart from Stammers, whose 29 years at BTR covered its growth from a stock market minnow into Britain's ninth biggest company, Jim Butler, 64, a former senior partner of KPMG Peat Marwick, and David Crowe, 54, a former senior partner of Gouldens, the city law firm, are joining Tomkins' board on March 1. Crowe is currently an executive director of TT Group, a small conglomerate which, like Tomkins, was set up by a former head of acquisitions at Hanson. Crowe's old law firm is Hanson's legal adviser. Greg Hutchings, Tomkins' chief executive, says that his three new non-execs will bring different things to the boardroom. In Stammers' case it is his operational skills. Crowe's legal expertise will help ensure that Tomkins complies with the Cadbury committee recommendations and Butler will advise on accounting standards and internal control (See Observer).</p>

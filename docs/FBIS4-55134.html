			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, May 7 (ATA) -- According to reports, a group  of 27 Albanians, mainly youngsters expelled from Sweden after  their requests for political asylum were refused, were not  allowed to return to Kosova. Police authorities at the Serbian  border said to the Swedish representatives who were accompanying  the Albanians that "the group cannot return to Kosova and you  can do anything you like with them."    This act ranks Serbia in the group of countries like Eritrea  and Ethiopia which do not accept their nationals return to the  country, the largest Swedish newspaper DAGENS NYHETER writes.  It also reports that a day after, the group of Albanians were  sent back to Stockholm and then to some cities in Sweden to stay  for some days until a reply will be given.    According to international convention of 1948, everyone has  the right to return to his country. But human rights are not of  any value in countries like Serbia, said Bjorn Gesta Sporong,  adviser in the Justice Department at the Swedish Foreign  Ministry.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dimitrije Boarov: "Insulted and Isolated"] </F>   [Text] It will take a very careful analysis of the  transcript to perhaps discover something new about the affair of  Dafiment Bank following the questioning of Mrs. Dafina Milanovic  before a committee of inquiry of the Yugoslav Assembly (on 10  February). At first glance the public and the committee of  inquiry got nothing but what might have been expected. The main  news is that Mrs. Dafina's defense seems to be aimed at passing  the buck to the Yugoslav and Serbian bank governors, who "did  not say `stop' at interest rates between 10 and 18 percent." The  mother of Serbian banking said in all seriousness that she would  have abided by a "decision" of any institution prohibiting  contracts calling for such high rates of interest.    The second great sin of the National Bank of Serbia in Mrs.  Dafina's opinion is that it did not agree to accept repayment of  the loan granted in March of last year to Dafiment Bank, for  which it had taken 251 kilograms of gold as collateral. During  the questioning Mrs. Milanovic also stressed several times that  her bank had never received a single dinar from primary issue,  although she admitted indirectly that it had been purchasing  foreign currencies on behalf of the National Bank of Serbia.  Asked whether she had street dealers, she replied that that was  a question to be put to all the banks.  <H5>  Names To Be Named Later </H5>   Mrs. Dafina expressed her most delicate charge against the  bank governors in describing the days after the flight of her  fellow banker, Master Jezda, and the collapse of Jugoskandik. At  that time, she said, she begged those responsible to accept the  "half-full vault of Dafiment Bank" in the State Treasury, but  they supposedly refused. It was then that many began to come for  their money with weapons in their hands, with hand grenades  around their neck, with pistols and knifes. Asked to name names,  Mrs. Dafina replied that she had already lost two children and  had only one left.    In response to the anticipated question that she cite the  names of politicians who withdrew their large deposits after the  bank collapsed and allegedly took a profit of about 70 million  marks [DM] in interest alone, even when everything had become  clear, Dafina Milanovic said with a noticeable dose of  bitterness that under a court order she would gladly present all  those names "from all the political parties." In connection with  a question about Milic from Macva she could not resist saying  that "even those she did not know" wanted to have their picture  taken with her at one time, but "now everyone shies away."    The list of basic "news items" might conclude with Mrs.  Dafina's assertion that she always had all the permits, that her  business was constantly being audited, and that no official  record of an audit had charged her with shady dealing, but  always were confined to technical deficiencies. Asked whether  she had promptly paid her taxes, she cited a case when  DM33,800,000 in taxes and fees were collected from her which the  state now admits she did not owe -- but of course it is offering  a nominal dinar refund of the overpaid tax.  <H5>  The Gentlemanly Members of the Committee of Inquiry </H5>   Trying to describe the dramatic tension which "conceived"  this performance before the committee of inquiry of the Yugoslav  Parliament is much more interesting than the early questioning.  (Although the association is a bit unfortunate, it was all a bit  like the film portrayal of Al Capone and other gentlemen from  Chicago being questioned before Congress.)    Even before the session began in the Yugoslav Assembly,  Revolution Boulevard was obstructed by a group of several  hundred aggrieved depositors, but the police had obviously  anticipated something of the kind, and traffic was quickly  diverted to neighboring streets. The demonstrators were of  course demanding their money, and one of the members of the  committee of inquiry even complained that they had shouted to  him that he was a thief. The group broke up rather quickly, they  seemed to have been more persistent when waiting in line  (according to recent estimates, Dafiment Bank owes about DM620  million to 450,000 depositors, while its property and  outstanding loans are estimated at about DM220 million).    Mrs. Dafina appeared before the committee of inquiry in a  subdued mauve suit. This time there was no gold in the jewelry  she wore, but there were precious stones in the silver ornaments  that remained. Her demeanor was "firm," with a tearful component  inserted whenever she mentioned children and the people. Deputy  Kastratovic was advised that the committee of inquiry had not  "brought" her there, but that she had come on her own to  "justify her pledge" and that she was there because she knew  people were hungry. In response to all the delicate questions,  instead of the U.S. "No comment," Mrs. Dafina replied, "I will  gladly answer that question in writing." One got the impression  that the members of the committee of inquiry were more afraid of  the questioning than Mrs. Dafina. Few people have ever before  seen such delicacy and beating about the bush, purported  understanding and gentlemanly etiquette in this parliamentary  building. Everyone who put questions advised all those present  "significantly" that Mrs. Dafina need not answer, since these  matters were "delicate." Only the journalists were surprised  that no one used such well-known verbs as to lie, to steal and  to rob.  <H5>  [Box, page 8] </H5> <H5>  The Resourceful Stalwarts in Montenegro </H5>   It just so happened that Mrs. Dafina Milanovic was given an  occasion for counterattack at the very outset of her appearance  before the committee of inquiry. Asked about the melancholy fate  of 12,000 depositors on the coast, who, by contrast with Jezda's  victims in Podgorica, were short-changed, Mrs. Dafina had a  ready answer.    According to her figures, an undischarged debt of DM7  million  remained of the DM19,800,000 that had been deposited in her  Montenegrin branches. She also said that she had informed  official authorities that her employees had misappropriated  DM4,800,000, that is, that there is no documentation on that  money at all and it never came into possession of Dafiment Bank.  This is a crime, then, which the local authorities did not react  to. Mrs. Dafina also complained that literally all the equipment  had been hauled away from her offices in Podgorica, Herceg-Novi  and other towns.    All in all, the now isolated owner of the largest bank in  the  Balkans said that in Montenegro she has damages amounting to DM3  million more than her obligations, and she advises the  depositors to apply to authorities in that republic, and she  promises that she will make public the charge which she has  filed with the competent authorities.  <H5>  [Box, page 9] </H5> <H5>  The Israeli Connection </H5>   Deputy Strahinja Kastratovic was interested in the cofounder  of the joint bank (that is, the one that obtained broad  authority to handle foreign exchange), the now well-known Mr.  Israel Kelman. Did this gentleman put up the founding capital,  did he take out any profit, and did he transfer any money from  the country "to Israel," Kastratovic asked.    Mrs. Dafina replied that in May 1992 Mr. Kelman put up a  share of DM2,500,000 and after that had the status of an adviser  to Dafiment Bank. She also declared with vigor that Mr. Kelman  had not taken anything "to Israel." It is still unknown whether  he took something to some other place.    Another Jewish name cropped up during the questioning of  Mrs.  Dafina. That is, she cited as one of the investments which time  has confirmed to afford an attractive profit the purchase of a  concession from the city of Belgrade to build a garage and to  lease it for 30 years (70 percent of gross income) for DM20  million. She said that her partner was Mr. David Dudal (if we  heard her correctly), manager of the firm LD Electronic.    Deputy Zoran Krasic had Mrs. Dafina repeat the statement  that  she had insured her deposits abroad and that the firm was ready  to come to her aid as soon as the sanctions are removed. It was  not stated what firm this is (a certain "Jardino Ineurano Broker  INT LTD" has been mentioned in the past), the amount of the  insurance premium that might have been paid, nor whether this is  once again some Jewish firm (if the firm in question exists at  all).</p>

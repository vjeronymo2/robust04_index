			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TITANS BEAT CHAPMAN IN THEIR BASEBALL OPENER  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton rallied for 3 runs in the seventh inning on its way to a  6-3 victory over Chapman in a nonconference baseball game Tuesday in front of  about 250 at Titan Field.  </P> <P> It was the season opener for Fullerton, which finished third in the College  World Series last season. Chapman is 1-2.  </P> <P> The Fullerton rally came at the expense of Chapman pitcher David Bird, a junior  left-hander from Sonora High School. Bird appeared in control over the first 6  innings, allowing 2 runs and 6 hits.  </P> <P> He had thrown 106 pitches through 6 innings and Chapman Coach Mike Weathers  said it was a gamble to let Bird continue in the seventh.  </P> <P> "It's time to stretch him out," Weathers said about Bird. "He pitched a good  game for the first 6 innings but he got tired and went to the fastball too much  in the seventh."  </P> <P> Bird's problems started with the first hitter. Rex Peters hit a home run to  left to tie it, 3-3.  </P> <P> Rich Gonzales followed with a single to center and then Brent Mayne singled to  left.  </P> <P> Fullerton's Rod Klopfer then bunted back to Bird, who looked at third but  decided to go to first -- only to have disaster strike.  </P> <P> Chapman first baseman Mike Guiseffi, who had charged on the bunt, was about 5  feet from the bag when he caught the ball. Klopfer was credited with a single  and Fullerton had the bases loaded.  </P> <P> Ralph Ramirez followed with a single, good for one run, and Fullerton led, 4-3.  </P> <P> Bird was replaced by Matt Patuano, who allowed a sacrifice fly to pinch-hitter  Trevor Neighbors before retiring the side.  </P> <P> Fullerton got its final run in the eighth on a single by Peters, a throwing  error and an RBI single by Brent Mayne.  </P> <P> Mayne, who hit .393 last season and Peters, who hit .330, were each 3 for 5  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Freshman shortstop Randy Graves had 3 hits and Klopfer and Mate Borgogno had 2  hits for Fullerton, which had 15.  </P> <P> The Titans did leave 11 runners left on base, though, including 7 by lead-off  hitter Bobby Jones.  </P> <P> "I was happy with the way we swung the bat," Fullerton Coach Larry Cochell  said. "But we have to have a lot better production with men on base."  </P> <P> Chapman had taken a 2-0 lead in the second. Jeff Kidwiler singled with 2 out  and Tony Gardea followed with a home run, his first this season, over the  left-field fence.  </P> <P> Fullerton got a run back in the fourth on a double by Klopfer, who went to  third on a double play and scored on a balk.  </P> <P> Graves tripled in the fifth for Fullerton and scored on a wild pitch.  </P> <P> Chapman took a 3-2 lead in the sixth on a triple by Ken Briggs and a sacrifice  fly by Rod Turner.  </P> <P> Chris Robinson, a sophomore right-hander from Troy High School, worked the  final 3 innings allowing a hit and 2 walks for the victory.  </P></p>

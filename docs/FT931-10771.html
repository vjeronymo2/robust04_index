			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Allied Dunbar new business fall ALLIED Dunbar Assurance, the financial services subsidiary of BAT Industries, yesterday announced a fall of 8 per cent in new business for 1992. Regular premiums declined, roughly in line with a marked trend for the industry, by 9 per cent from Pounds 178.7m to Pounds 162.1m. Single premium products, however, also fell by 8 per cent from Pounds 683m to Pounds 631m. Single premium life and pension business both registered increases, of 26 per cent and 10 per cent respectively, however, and the company attributed the poor overall results for single premiums to its withdrawal from guaranteed income bonds and home income plans, which in 1991 accounted for Pounds 110m. The company has also been reluctant to accept transfers from occupational pension schemes which have been lucrative for other companies. Business placed through independent financial advisers, measured in terms of commission paid, rose by 9 per cent. Sales through the Allied Dunbar direct sales force fell, partly thanks to a fall in numbers from 4,800 to 4,500. Several salesmen were recruited by J Rothschild Assurance, set up by former Allied Dunbar executives, which started at the beginning of last year. Allied Dunbar does not have a 'with-profits' life fund, and was unable to boost single premiums by offering with-profits bonds, which proved to be the highest selling products launched by the industry last year. Total funds under management, buoyed by strong market performance during the year, rose by 18 per cent to Pounds 11bn compared with Pounds 9.3bn, while new sums assured rose by 14 per cent to Pounds 7.5bn.</p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Sex bias payouts found to have risen sevenfold Payouts in sexual discrimination cases have risen sevenfold since a European Court of Justice ruling removed the statutory limit, an independent pay analyst says today. The equal opportunities review published by Industrial Relations Services says that the decision has forced employers to take equal-opportunities issues more seriously. The report says that even when the awards made against the Ministry of Defence over pregnancy dismissal cases are excluded the figures still show that awards made by industrial tribunals in cases of unlawful discrimination have risen 45 per cent. The average compensation award over the 10 months before the European court decision in November was Pounds 3,044. Since the decision the average has risen to Pounds 21,785, mainly because of the MoD awards. Without the MoD awards, however, the rise was still significant, increasing to Pounds 4,328. Average awards for injury to feelings also rose from Pounds 1,371 before the European court ruling to Pounds 1,796 afterwards. Mr Gary Bowker, co-editor of the review, said: 'There is now a clear financial incentive for employers to take equal treatment seriously and import the principles of equality law into their personnel decisions.'

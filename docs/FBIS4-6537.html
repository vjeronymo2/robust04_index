			<p>BFN     [Text] It was disclosed on 19 April that 17 lower and  upper house lawmakers from the Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ], including Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and former Chairman  Makoto Tanabe, attended North Korean President Kim Il-song's  birthday celebration held on 13 April at the Chosensoren  [General Assembly of Korean Residents in Japan] Central Hall in  Tokyo.    According to several concerned people, those who attended  the  birthday celebration were Masako Goto, first secretary to lower  house Speaker Takako Doi; SDPJ Chairman Murayama; former SDPJ  Chairman Tanabe; Koken Nosaka, chairman of the SDPJ Diet Policy  Committee; Akihiro Ohata; Kenji Taguchi; Yuzuru Shimazaki;  Ichiro Hino; Issei Inoue; Tatsukuni Komori; Hajime Fukata;  Tatsuo Yoshida; Eiko Mieno; Hisato Kishimoto; Atsushi Kameyama;  Yutaka Shitoma; and Sumiko Shimizu.    Reportedly, Goto attended on behalf of Doi because she had  an  appointment with a top foreign leader. About 300 senior  executives of the major mass media--except for SANKEI  SHIMBUN--attended the celebration. It is said that after a  speech by the organizer, the attendants increased exchanges  [koryu o fukameta] while standing around the food tables.    President Kim Il-song's birthday celebration is an annual  event held prior to the actual day of his birth; many SDPJ  lawmakers attended. However, it seems likely the UNSC will  adopt a resolution designed to impose economic sanctions against  North Korea over North Korea's suspected nuclear arms  development. Therefore, the U.S. Government is pressing Japan  to cooperate in imposing sanctions. Moreover, the international  community is criticizing Japan regarding the issue of remitting  money to North Korea, saying it deviates from the trend of the  international situation.    Meanwhile, North Korean issues are becoming a focal point at  the ruling coalition parties' policy meetings for the formation  of a post-Hosokawa administration. Therefore, it is expected  that having many SDPJ lawmakers attend the celebration will  create a stir in the future.</p>

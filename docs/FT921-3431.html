			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Letter: Insurance ticket option offers BR profit and client peace Sir, Some rail users prefer cheap fares (for example, those on low incomes), others demand a reliable service or compensation (for example, to travel to Gatwick for a flight). I suggest that BR should give passengers the option of buying an 'insurance ticket' at the same time as their rail ticket. The insurance ticket would duplicate the rail ticket information, and also specify the route and arrival time (this information stored electronically would be invaluable to BR planning). The compensation rates should be laid down, and depend on the lateness of the train, lack of facilities, and amount of insurance purchased. They could include death and injury benefits. That scheme should make a small profit for BR, its main advantage (unlike other proposed schemes) is that it is can be administered. It will improve services in affluent regions, but other regions will benefit as rail users realise the profitability of buying insurance on unreliable routes.

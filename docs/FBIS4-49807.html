			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, May 10 (CNS) -- Shanghai's industrial  production has risen further with its total industrial output  value in April being RMB [renminbi] 35.275 billion, 3.7 percent  up on that in March and 16 percent up over the same period last  year.    Shanghai has set 12 percent for this year's GNP growth rate  and the total industrial output value will have a growth rate of  over 15 percent at least. In January this year, the industrial  output value totalled RMB 19 billion, 13 percent up over the  same period of last year.    Experts in Shanghai consider the reason for the rise in  industrial production there was that the impact of macro-control  and relevant reform measures adopted by the central government  had eased in Shanghai and the economy there had started to  operate as expected. In addition, achievements in the  utilization of funds, market development and reform of  state-owned enterprises were also part of the reason.    Production and marketing of Shanghai's industry increased at  the same pace from January to April this year. The total  industrial output value from January to April increased by 14.6  percent over the same period of last year and the total sales  value was 15.1 percent up. The ratio of production to sales was  95.74 percent and in April this ratio reached 97.5 percent.    Experts, however, warned that the tasks of curbing inflation  and reducing enterprise losses remained arduous. Shanghai Mayor  Mr. Huang Ju said recently that pushing forward sales was the  principal task. Meanwhile, arrangements for funds, utilization  of foreign capital, and municipal engineering projects should  also be well handled while certain reform measures would be  implemented at the proper time.</p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Observer: Jobsworthy Jimmy Lai, the Hong Kong businessman who was recently forced to relinquish his position at the helm of retailer Giordano - following a scathing attack on Li Peng, the Chinese premier - is entering the world of newspapers. Lai, who already owns Next, the successful weekly where he lambasted Li and China's communist party, is planning to launch a new Hong Kong daily by next spring. Rumour has it that he will call it either Apple or Pingguo, which is Chinese for apple. Apple, Next . . . sounds familiar. Steve Jobs founded Apple and, after being forced out, went on to found Next. Lai, an aficionado of philosopher Karl Popper's The Open Society and its Enemies, is also a fan of Jobs. Why not save himself the trouble of thinking up titles for the new paper and just call it Jobs for the Boys?</p>

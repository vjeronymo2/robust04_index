			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "The Voz Andes Newscast"] </F>   [Text] The government has not proposed a general program of  privatization, but a modernization program, Government Minister  Marcelo Santos stated. The privatizations are an aspect of  modernization; they will occur where they are required so that  this process can have positive results, the minister added. The  modernization process is a fact and it will be developed and  implemented, the minister continued.    Meanwhile, (Jose Maria Cabascango), leader of the National  Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador, said the  Indian movement is not opposed to the modernization of the  country, but it is opposed to the indiscriminate privatization  of state-owned companies. That is why, he remarked, we will  continue to support the struggle throughout the country with  mobilizations and assemblies.    Minister Marcelo Santos asserted that the first day of the  48-hour strike occurred without major incidents, although there  were some sporadic incidents in various areas in the country.  Santos said the strike is progressing normally and the rights  of workers and other sectors have been respected, particularly  those of Indians who have blocked traffic between provinces.  The minister stated the government is not expecting acts of  violence, but the police and Armed Forces are ready to guarantee  the peace and security of Ecuadorans.</p>

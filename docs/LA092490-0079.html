			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET PREMIER PREDICTS DISASTER IF RADICAL ECONOMIC PLAN WINS OUT;  </P> <P> RESTRUCTURING: RYZHKOV CALLS FOR A COMPROMISE TO KEEP FROM PLUNGING THE NATION  INTO CHAOS.  </P> <P> Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, fighting radical proposals for  sweeping economic changes, appealed Sunday to the country's lawmakers to reject  a program, endorsed by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, that would bring a quick  end to state management of the economy.  </P> <P> Warning that an overnight end to state ownership of industry and agriculture  and government central planning would plunge the Soviet Union into chaos,  Ryzhkov called for a compromise that would ensure the gradual development of a  market economy but without further jeopardizing the country's stability.  </P> <P> With a vote possible this week in the Supreme Soviet, the country's  legislature, on two rival reform programs -- the radicals' plan for a 500-day  transformation of the Soviet economy and his own plan for a gradual transition  -- Ryzhkov urged the utmost caution in making what will be a fundamental change  for the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "The country is not ready for a sharp swerve," Ryzhkov said in an interview on  national television. "We are not ready to transfer to a new (economic) system,  neither psychologically nor organizationally. . . . The market means freedom,  but we have been working in a system based on direction and (central)  administration. . . .  </P> <P> "It is impossible to shift to a market economy in 100 days or 500 days. This is  not realistic. This is only the beginning of the transition, and the transition  will take years, not days. One cannot calculate this in days or months."  </P> <P> Leonid I. Abalkin, the Soviet vice premier in charge of economic reform, was  equally blunt as the government, faced with likely defeat in the Supreme  Soviet, mounted an open counterattack following the radicals' success in  winning Gorbachev's support, equivocal and wavering though it has been.  </P> <P> The country's economic situation is so perilous, Abalkin told the conservative  newspaper Sovetskaya Rossiya, that "we are at the edge of an abyss. Any  careless move can push us over. We have to appeal to people's reason."  </P> <P> Both the measures and the timetable in the radicals program are unrealistic,  Abalkin said, arguing that it is "simply impossible to restructure everything  in weeks, months and maybe even years."  </P> <P> Abalkin suggested that the radicals' proposals, dubbed the Shatalin Program  after Gorbachev adviser Stanislav S. Shatalin, the principal author, amount to  little more than what in American politics a few years ago might have been  called voodoo economics.  </P> <P> "People are being assured that there is a miraculous means -- and our people  trust and believe in miracles -- by which they can move forward without plan,  sacrifice or shocks, without decreasing their standard of living or increasing  prices," Abalkin said.  </P> <P> "In such crisis situations, people begin to believe en masse in all sorts of  things -- extraterrestrial beings, UFOs, extrasensory phenomena. The 500-day  program also contains a certain mysterious element. The idea of its miraculous  power has been pushed consistently into the mass consciousness, but nobody has  seen it."  </P> <P> At the same time, he said, "People are not ready to work in new conditions.  Political instability in society, the activity of certain (political) forces,  growing national separatism should also be kept in mind.  </P> <P> "All this leads us to conclude," Abalkin said, "that if we move too fast and do  not consider the possible consequences, it can result in a greater crisis in  the economy and kill any desire to attempt reforms in the near future."  </P> <P> The government has specific, realistic plans for a step-by-step transition to a  market economy, he said. Among the immediate measures are increased prices for  agricultural produce in an effort to stimulate the production of food and of  some raw materials for industry.  </P> <P> Embattled with calls countrywide for his resignation, Ryzhkov acknowledged the  appeal that the radicals' proposals have because of their promise of swift  improvement in the current economic crisis.  </P> <P> Although the government is convinced that its approach is correct, it is  willing to discuss the speed and ways that a market economy is developed to  replace that which the state has run for seven decades, he said.  </P> <P> "To my mind, we will come to some compromise," Ryzhkov said. "We have to take  both programs and try to put them together."  </P> <P> Ryzhkov said that another basic difference, in addition to the speed of change,  between his program and that of the radicals is the political character of the  Soviet Union in the future as a federal state.  </P> <P> While he envisions "a strong, united sovereign state" made up of constituent  republics, the radicals believe it should be "a kind of an economic union of  completely independent states united on the basis of certain interests,"  Ryzhkov said.  </P> <P> "This profoundly changes the approach to our country's future," he said. "Our  concept is based on the assumption of building an economy that would unite the  country and enable us to take advantage of our vast territory and riches."  </P> <P> The Shatalin plan is "essentially based on the recognition of the liquidation  of the Soviet Union as a state," Abalkin said, arguing that it would no longer  be a political but an economic union like that of the European Community or  Comecon, the socialist trading bloc.  </P> <P> But the radicals continued to seek support for their fast-change approach.  </P> <P> "If we are late, we will lose everything," said Mikhail Poltoranin, the  information minister for the Russian Federation, which has already adopted the  500-day program. "We are coming closer to 1991 and, as far as I know, the  expected deficit in the state budget will grow to 340 billion rubles ($544  billion at official exchange rates). That is our death."  </P></p>

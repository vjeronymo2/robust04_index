			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Winfried Muenster: "Brussels Remains on Guard"] </F>   [Text] The European Commission has predicted a real  economic growth of 1.25 percent this year and a 2.1 percent  growth in 1995 in the European Union [EU], thereby adhering to  its restrained forecast made in late autumn, even though most EU  countries have declared that their economies are happily  improving again. But the economic development observers in  Brussels are not so sure about this, and claim that what little  improvement occurs will have little bearing on the labor market.  Unemployment in the EU will almost certainly rise from its  current 11 percent to 11.25 percent next year, before it  "generally falls again."    The optimistic forecasts come from Germany because German  exports have unexpectedly improved. But the European Commission  does not see such an improvement in the rest of the EU. "The  economy," says the European Commission in its annual economic  report," could develop more unfavorably than expected if  investor confidence decreases." The continuing restrictive  monetary policy in most member countries, the absence of  competitiveness in third markets, and the "continuing low degree  of confidence on the part of consumers" are still preventing  economic growth, say the people in Brussels. They hasten to add  that a "faster decrease in credit interest rates might be  required" in order to improve the economic climate. However,  this is already happening to a pleasing degree. Long-term  interest rates gradually fell from an average of 11 percent in  1990, their high point, to 6.5 percent in January, and have  fallen even further since. Therefore, on an EU average, they  are lower than in the United States.    The economic development researchers in Brussels place  particular emphasis on competitiveness on world markets, saying  that "this has remained relatively weak in relation to costs and  other determinants," so that exporters are "not always in a  position to profit from the consolidation of world-wide economic  activity." The EU reports a trade deficit of the equivalent of  137 billion German marks [DM] in 1992 (the 1993 figures are not  available yet), compared to DM62 billion in 1989, the final  almost complete year before the turnabout in the East.  Therefore, the EU deficit is higher than that of the United  States.    The European Commission considers the domestic budgets of  the  EU member countries to be one of the factors restricting  economic growth. Instead of backing up the still shaky economic  improvement by means of a stable policy, virtually all the EU  member countries are compelled to resort to consolidation  programs because the budget deficit is increasing almost in  every EU country. Whatever the case, the EU will remain the  weakest economic area at least until next year. In 1995, the  men in Brussels predict a real growth of 2.6 percent in the  United States, a 2.8 percent growth in Japan, a 2.9 percent  growth in European Free Trade Association, and a mere 3.1  percent growth on a world level.</p>

			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWSBITES: A NEW RIB TRADER: FUN IN THE JUNGLE  </P> <P> More new restaurants:  </P> <P> * Dana Point obviously was ready for a Rib Trader. The restaurant, first  offshoot of the original in San Clemente, opened recently to capacity crowds.  </P> <P> Don Long, who has owned restaurants in Los Angeles, executed a complete redo of  the former Capers, and it's a jungle in there, complete with exotic plants and  replicas of rhinos and such. The specialty, of course, is barbecue, featuring  Midwest cornfed beef, but there's more, including fresh abalone daily. The  average dinner price is $11, and it's fun, casual; no reservations. Mondays  through Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., Sundays from 4:30 to 11 p.m. at  34150 Pacific Coast Highway. (714) 661-0119.  </P> <P> * The Athenian, at 5874 Edinger Ave. in Huntington Beach's Marina Village  Center, recently began serving 50 Greek specialties from chicken stuffed with  spinach, onions and feta cheese to lamb dishes, stuffed grape leaves and gyros.  Chef Aristidis D. Deslis used to be with Greek Cuisine of Tustin. Lunch,  Mondays through Fridays: $4.95 to $15.95. Dinner nightly: $7.95 to 8.95. (714)  840-6518.  </P> <P> * Mezzaluna is the new Italian kid on the block, having taken the old  Hemingway's location at 2441 E. Coast Highway in Corona del Mar. There are sky  and cloud scenes on the ceilings and almost a hundred paintings and art works  on the walls. And there are homemade pizzas and pastas, salads and antipasti at  prices ranging from $5.50 to $13. Lunches Monday through Friday, dinner nighly  from 5 to midnight, and on Saturdays it's open all day starting at 11:30 a.m.  (714) 675-2004. BEVERLY BUSH SMITH  </P></p>

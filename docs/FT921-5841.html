			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / International Company News: Porsche sees profit, but fewer sales MR ARNO BOHN, the chief executive of Porsche who threatened to resign unless the supervisory board renewed his contract beyond the end of this year, said the company faced hard times but would make a profit this financial year. His statement comes at a time of renewed speculation about the future of the German luxury sports car company. Toyota, the Japanese motor group, denied a report in a German magazine that it had offered DM5bn (Dollars 3bn) to buy Porsche. After Mr Bohn's ultimatum, the supervisory board confirmed his contract would be extended for a further three years after December. This was done at a meeting on Wednesday of the non-executive board, which contains representatives of the controlling Porsche and Piech families. Mr Bohn made no comment about the attitude of the supervisory board, which had failed to confirm, by the necessary two-thirds majority, at its previous meeting last week that his contract would be extended. Wednesday's vote, which only needed a simple majority, was unanimous. He said Porsche would sell fewer cars this year than the 26,200 sold in 1990-91. However, the Stuttgart-based company would gain a new impetus in the mid-1990s with its new sports car, which would be cheaper than those in its present range, though still aimed at wealthy buyers. In its last financial year to July, 1991, Porsche's net profits plunged by 70 per cent to DM17m as a result of both falling sales and provisions of around DM60m to cover future business risks and job cuts. The company is putting 4,000 of its 9,000 employees on short-time between April and June. It is also shedding 550 production workers.</p>

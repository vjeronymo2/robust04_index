			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Battle is rejoined over health service funding BRITAIN's health managers yesterday reopened the question of how the National Health Service should be financed with a set of radical ideas that coincide with the timing of the government's public spending review. For the first time, the Institute of Health Services Management has qualified its strong support for retaining the tax-based system of funding the NHS, saying that 'the limitations of general taxation are increasingly evident'. Mr David Knowles, the institute's president, told its annual conference in Birmingham that unelected health authorities lacked 'an adequate level of legitimacy'. He suggested some health responsibilities could be transferred to local authorities. An institute working party examining the future of the NHS, following the government's 1991 reforms, concluded in a report published yesterday that funding by general taxation alone placed the service at the mercy of Whitehall. The institute suggested the possibility of supplementing tax funding through social insurance, financed by a payroll tax, a dedicated income tax or local taxation. The Thatcher government considered many such alternatives in a review leading to the reforms, but rejected them. Health ministers have no desire for the public spending review now being undertaken by Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary at the Treasury, to reopen the funding issue - but continuing spending pressures could do so. The Department of Health is also conducting a review of NHS structure, which is due to report next month. Mr Knowles told the conference that local decisions on health spending priorities could be achieved only through local democracy. Before the 1991 reforms health authorities, meeting in public and with some members nominated by local authorities, looked recognisably like public bodies. 'Their replacement, however, with smaller, much more managerially focused, bodies has shifted the balance of their accountability and legitimacy,' Mr Knowles said. The Conservative-dominated Commons' health select committee yesterday recommended that free dental check-ups and routine treatment should be available to everyone. This would mean an end to the present charges for services such as check-ups and X-rays. The cross-party committee of MPs said patients would have to pay for other dental work, such as crowns and bridgework, up to a maximum of Pounds 250 as currently. People who are exempt from these services would continue to receive them free of charge, they added.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] "The idea of possibly prolonging parliament's and  the president's authorities voiced by Federation Council Speaker  Vladimir Shumeyko is not new," Russian president's aide Georgiy  Satarov declared in his interview with INTERFAX. He underlined  that a month ago during a meeting between the president and the  Liberal Democratic Union of December 12 deputy group of the  State Duma, Deputy Irina Khakamada asked Yeltsin about his  attitude towards possible prolonging of the parliament's term in  office.    In Satarov's words, Yeltsin answered that he does not oppose  this "in the case that the State Duma and Federation Council  work efficiently."    Satarov also underlined that "this idea was discussed in  professional circles long ago."    When asked by Khakamada what is Yeltsin's attitude towards  prolongation of his term in office, the latter said: "Do not  touch upon the 1996 elections."    At the same time Satarov indicated that he would not  interpret these words, he is just repeating them.    As Satarov said, if the idea of extension of the terms in  office prevails then the appropriate change to the acting  Constitution will have to be adopted by a referendum. However,  the issue on a referendum is still open until the State Duma and  Federation Council adopts a decree on referendums.</p>

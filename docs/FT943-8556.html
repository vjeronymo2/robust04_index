			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Top UK companies ignore advice on directors' contracts Nearly half of the UK's 100 largest listed companies have directors on three-year rolling contracts, contrary to practices recommended by leading investment institutions. A Financial Times survey shows that 44 of the FT-SE 100 companies still have these contracts, which can impose huge compensation costs when directors resign or are dismissed. They include Royal Bank of Scotland, Royal Insurance and Unilever, where 13 directors are on three-year rolling contracts. Concern about the costs of such contracts has recently been echoed by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch publishing group, disclosed this week that it had agreed to make severance payments worth Pounds 2.02m to Mr Peter Davis, former co-chairman, who resigned in June. Mr Davis was on a three-year rolling contract. Several companies have recently revealed that they have amended their directors' contracts. British Gas is the latest company to disclose that it has cut its contracts to two years. BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services group, has inserted a clause in directors' contracts obliging any director leaving the company to take all possible steps to find new employment 'commensurate with your standing and expertise'. Failure to do so may reduce any pay-out. Two months ago, PosTel, the Pounds 25bn pension fund, started voting against the election and re-election of directors who have rolling service contracts longer than two years. Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of PosTel, said yesterday: 'A trickle of companies changing their contracts has turned to a steady flow.' Using information available to it as shareholders in the UK's chief companies, PosTel has drawn up a 'hit-list' of directors whom it is opposing at AGMs. The Financial Times survey is based on the same information available to shareholders about directors' contracts. It found that there are nine FT-SE 100 companies which have recently moved away from three-year rolling contracts or are doing so. These include the drinks group Guinness and British Aerospace.

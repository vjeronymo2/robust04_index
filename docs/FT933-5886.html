			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Arts: Retrotelly: where trash becomes art - Television SUMMER 1993 is proving a less than glittering season on British television. There are several possible reasons. The BBC has been going through the largest managerial change in its 70 year history: the 'Birtian revolution' is being felt on screen, staff are preoccupied with operating the corporation's new internal market, 'Producer Choice', and both BBC channels have new controllers, Alan Yentob, former controller of BBC2 having moved to BBC1, with his protege Michael Jackson taking over BBC2. Perhaps it would be remarkable if, in the midst of such upheavals, they managed to create sparkling schedules, especially as the summer is always the dullest season of television's year anyway. Yet even taking all that into account, BBC programmes seem to have been more drab and uninviting than you might expect. It is hard to escape the feeling that this has something to do with attempts to offset those huge over-spends a year or so ago when tens of millions of pounds 'went missing' (in the ghastly phrase so beloved of television news programmes) because, if I understand correctly, in the days before Mr Birt's accountants moved in, different BBC departments withdrew the same sums of money several times over from computerised budgets without anyone noticing what was going on. This summer's abnormally large number of repeats could, perhaps, have something to do with balancing the books. ITV has also been feeling the effects of the largest managerial change in its history. True, their old system lasted less than 40 years, and some of the regional production companies - London Weekend (with 16 new millionaires on its staff last week thanks to the share options which held them in 'golden handcuffs' through the supposed temptations to move elsewhere at the time of the licence auction) Anglia, Scottish and so on - have remained where they were, and to some extent as they were, through the revolution brought about by the franchise system. But the new process for getting programmes on to the air, with the Network Centre taking over as scheduling dictator from the old committee, or 'horse trading' system, has probably still not had its full effect on screen. Lead times for the production of big television series run into years, so we shall not see the full effect of the Network Centre's decisions even in the coming autumn season. However, some anxious programme makers are already suggesting that the centre, fearful about such long lead times, is opting for 'short termism' and declining to support, say, documentary schemes which need several years to come to fruition, or even to commission a series as well-tried as This Is Your Life for more than 12 months. It seems it was this that drove its producers (Thames Television, now the biggest of Britain's independents, having lost their London licence to Carlton) back into the arms of the BBC where they were offered a contract for several years. Whatever the background, this summer season has felt more top heavy with repeats than any before. It has previously been argued here that, With the growing number of channels these days, any television service which reckons to go beyond sheer time-filling ought to be producing a considerable proportion of programmes worthy of repeat since most viewers will inevitably miss the first transmission. That does not seem to be a common view, however. Even though repeats of series such as Open All Hours and The Good Life are so popular that they regularly feature in Top 20 lists, many viewers still consider all repeats a form of 'cheating' by the broadcasters and they assume that programme controllers should and do feel ashamed about being forced into using quite so many. But matters do not seem to be quite as simple as that. The gap between a common or garden repeat and a 'retro' series is virtually invisible, and retrotelly, at least among broadcasters, is becoming fashionable. This column has long campaigned to sustain 10 per cent or so of the output from British television at a level which will make it attractive to the sort of people who read this page. BBC2 has always been the main provider of that sort of programme. Last week Jackson announced his plans for the autumn and he did have good news, especially in drama: The Changeling, Suddenly Last Summer, Hedda Gabler and The Entertainer with Michael Gambon as Archie Rice are due this autumn. But in other categories, particularly music and arts, things look more doubtful: animated versions of great opera arias and a 13-part series 'featuring archive footage of some of radio's greatest disc jockeys in action'. Most ominous was the manner in which Jackson chose to be photographed at his press conference. With an oil painting to mark the repeat of Civilisation? No. With a piano as a reminder of coverage of the Leeds competition? No. He went before the cameras with a Captain Scarlet puppet to illustrate his decision to repeat the sub-Thunderbirds series Captain Scarlet And The Mysterons. Could it be that Jackson, the first channel controller to have been through the 'media studies' mill, is part of the Modern Review crowd who sincerely believe that Dr Who, the Mario Brothers and the Bay City Rollers are just as significant as Dr Faustus, The Brothers Karamazov and Beethoven, and that they have just as much to contribute to the arts? It looks as though that may be so. Time was when it was thought a bit of a giggle to raid the archives and pull out the most dreadfully dated junk to show over a bank holiday. John Wyver and Paul Madden started it at Channel 4, and in small amounts at long intervals it was, indeed, amusing, like coming across an episode of Hopalong Cassidy on the cable network while stuck in some US hotel room overnight. But all of a sudden it seems to have gone from a bit of a giggle to a deadly serious part of the scheduling battle. It is not always necessarily dirt cheap to show old (British) programmes; you may have to track down surviving actors and pay them again. It is fair to assume, however, that BBC2's 12 hours of programmes from the 1960s on Bank Holiday Monday, from 11.30 am to 11.30 pm, worked out a lot cheaper than making 12 hours of high quality programmes. There were mesmerising moments - Sandie Shaw in white flying helmet, clear wraparound plastic specs and huge false eyelashes, driving a sportscar along a beach while singing 'Get Your Kicks On Route 66', the cast of Adam Adamant looking and sounding like a bad drama class, Paul Johnson telling Germaine Greer 'We used to have the most wonderful parties at 10 Downing Street' - but if a joke it went on too long. If not a joke, if people high up in the BBC have really come to believe that schlock telly is a subject as worthy of our attention as renaissance painting or grand opera, then in spite of what has been argued here in the past, we may be approaching a time when television will no longer be a fit medium for grown ups. Why has BBC2 made three programmes about David Frost rather than three about Peter Brook or George Steiner? Presumably because, first, people in television, the world's most self-regarding industry, honestly think that Frost is more important and, second, because the material on Frost but not on Brook or Steiner is all there in the archives. It is one thing to fill the summer schedules with repeats of modern programmes for short-term budgetary reasons. It is quite another thing, at a time when the BBC is so insistent upon the need to provide high quality and be distinct from other broadcasters, to start packing the schedules with precisely the same sort of cheap retrotelly we are being offered by the satellite channels UK Gold and Bravo. If the people who run the BBC are going to march with bright smiles into that trendy world of relativism where all values are equal, then it does look as though the falcon cannot hear the falconer.</p>

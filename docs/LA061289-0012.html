			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Late spring in Texas was anything but mild as the state was pounded by  thunderstorms, tornadoes and golf-ball-size hail. Twisters touched down near  Pandora, Langtry and San Antonio, damaging several buildings and a mobile home.  The high winds picked up a storage shed and threw it 100 yards, while a tree  snapped in San Antonio and fell on a home. The biggest hail fell in Kinney  County and Ping-Pong-ball-size hail was reported at Alamo Heights. Four inches  of rain fell in Abilene, pushing a foot of water over the spillway of Lytle  Lake. The storms dumped heavy rain in Oklahoma and Kansas, causing rivers and  streams to rise across the southern plains. Coffeyville, Kan., got 7 1/4 inches  of rain. "These storms developed due to warm, humid Gulf of Mexico air  streaming northward and an upper air disturbance moving across the central  plains," said National Weather Service forecaster Brian Smith.  </P></p>

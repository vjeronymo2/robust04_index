			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Claes favoured for top Nato post Mr Willy Claes, the Belgian foreign minister, has emerged as favourite to become the next secretary-general of Nato. Mr Claes, a Flemish Socialist who won plaudits for his forceful leadership during last year's Belgian presidency of the EU, has secured broad support among European allies. The US has apparently tipped the balance by signalling it has no objection to Mr Claes's bid to succeed Mr Manfred Worner, who died of cancer last month. 'There is a feeling that he could grow in the job like Manfred Worner,' said a Brussels diplomat. A final decision is likely when EU foreign ministers meet their Canadian and US counterparts at the UN general assembly in New York at the end of this month. Neither of the two other candidates - Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, a Norwegian who is the UN mediator in former Yugoslavia, and Mr Hans van den Broek, the European Commissioner for external political affairs - looks strong. Mr van den Broek is said to be willing to step aside after the new Dutch coalition government's decision this week not to oppose Mr Claes. He would like to stay on in Brussels and has secured the Hague's support for holding on to his current portfolio at the Commission. Mr Stoltenberg's candidacy is trickier to handle. Until recently, Norway thought it had an inside track on the job after it agreed to support Germany's campaign to give Mr Worner a second term. Rumours that Mr Claes's appointment could force Mr Karel van Miert to step down as Belgium's EU Commissioner responsible for competition policy, were dismissed in Brussels last night. Mr Claes told Reuters last night: 'I have said I am interested ..but I am not lobbying and it is in the interests of the credibility of the organisation to have a serious consensus.' Traditionally, the post of Nato secretary-general goes to a European, while that of Supreme Allied Commander is reserved for an American.</p>

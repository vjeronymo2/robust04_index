			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Yu Kun-ha] </F>   [Text] Sharp growth in the exports of computers and  communications equipment last year pulled the domestic  electronics industry out of the sluggishness of 1992.    This year, the high export growth rate of over 20 percent  marked in 1993 is likely to be maintained, expanding the  industry's exports from $5.1 billion to $6.2 billion. This  projection by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy  (MOTIE), however, is based on the condition that the Japanese  yen remains strong. Signs are emerging, however, which indicate  a weakening of the Japanese currency.    Production of computer hardware, telephones, facsimiles,  telephone exchanges and other equipment amounted to about $8.2  billion last year, up 13.4 percent from 1992.    This year, the aggregate output is expected to grow by 17  percent and hit $9.6 billion. Domestic demand for computers and  personal communications equipment will also expand by around 9  percent with the advance of the nation toward an  information-based society.    The industry's single largest export item is computer  monitors. The nation's four major monitor producers -- Samsung,  Goldstar, Hyundai and Daewoo -- churned out a total of $2  billion worth of monitors last year, accounting for about 30  percent of the world market in terms of quantity last year. In  terms of value, Korea is second only to Taiwan in the monitor  market.    Monitor producers are expected to enjoy brisk business this  year as demand for personal computers in the United States is  recovering while that in the European Community will continue to  increase sharply.    Exports of personal computers (PCs) are also expected to  rise, by some 20 percent, this year, if demand in the United  States, which accounts for 80 percent of Korean shipments  abroad, continues to center around the 486-class PCs.    More than half of PC exports, however, will be made under  the  OEM (original equipment manufacturer) formula. Samsung, the  largest of the Big Five computer makers, showed the highest OEM  rate -- 84 percent of its exports worth $190 million last year  were made under the OEM formula.    Sambo, which is the leader in the domestic market, was  second  with 58 percent, while the remaining three -- Goldstar, Daewoo  and Hyundai -- exported 90 percent of their PCs with their own  brand names attached.    In all, the five computer assemblers are forecast to export  $539 million worth of PCs this year, a level which still falls  far short of 1991's $719 million.    For the Korean mass producers, 1992 was a disastrous year.  In that year, world PC demand shifted from the 286-class to the  386- class and then to the 486-class. The change was simply too  rapid for the Korean mass producers, who were unable to alter  their production lines. As a result, exports were more than  halved to a mere $332 million.    The five PC makers plan to spend some $44 million for  research and development of high-function notebook computers,  the so-called personal digital assistants (PDAs), multimedia  PCs, Pentium PCs and other high value-added products.    Exports of computers and peripheral equipment are projected  to total $3.78 billion this year, up 20 percent from the 1993  estimate of $3.15 billion.    In the telecommunications field, exports are expected to  grow  at a similar rate to that of the computer industry. Production,  however, will grow by a far lower rate of 8 percent on average  mainly because of the expected low demand for wire  telecommunications equipment and a sharp drop in Korea Telecom's  purchase of domestic telephone exchanges.    In contrast, domestic demand for mobile telecommunications  devices such as pagers and cellular phones will continue to grow  rapidly, causing a corresponding increase in imports of these  products.    Last year, over half of the domestic demand for cellular  phones was met by Motorola, the world leader in this field.  Samsung, Goldstar and Hyundai, the three key Korean players in  the market, accounted for 16 percent, 12 percent and 4 percent  of sales, respectively. New firms are entering into this fast  growing and lucrative business.    Exports of telephones, especially cellular phones, and  facsimiles are expected to grow by over 20 percent this year as  domestic producers are turning out new products.    Telephone exports (wire, cordless and cellular) are forecast  to total $463 million, up 22 percent from 1993, while facsimile  shipments will grow by 26.5 percent to mark $215 million.    Korean-developed digital telephone exchanges are also likely  to see a sharp increase in exports. The three producers who  jointly developed the TDX exchange -- Samsung, Goldstar and  Daewoo -- are eager to explore new markets for the products.  The three plan to raise their combined exports to $105 million  this year, up 28 percent from 1993.    Domestic demand for the exchanges, however, will grow only 3  to 4 percent as Korea Telecom has been reducing its purchases  with the progress in its telephone network modernization program.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Industrial Electronics Industry in 1993 and 1994                            |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(Unit: $ million)                                                           |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |          |1992                 |1993 (estimate)      |1994(projection)     |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |          |          |increase (|          |increase (|          |increase (|  |          |          |percent)  |          |percent)  |          |percent)  |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Production|7,221     |1.6       |8,188     |13.4      |9,579     |17        |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Imports   |3,205     |-9.2      |3,629     |13.2      |3,934     |8.4       |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Domestic  |6,199     |-8.0      |6,707     |8.2       |7,313     |9.0       |  |sales     |          |          |          |          |          |          |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Exports   |4,227     |8.5       |5,110     |20.8      |6,200     |21.3      |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Production and export projections for major items                           |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(Unit: $ million)                                                           |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |          |Production                      |Exports                         |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |          |1993      |1994      |increase (|1993      |1994      |increase (|  |          |          |          |percent)  |          |          |percent)  |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Computer  |4,560     |5,472     |20.0      |3,148     |3,777     |20.0      |  |and perip-|          |          |          |          |          |          |  |heral equ-|          |          |          |          |          |          |  |ipment    |          |          |          |          |          |          |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Telephone-|637       |769       |20.7      |380       |463       |21.8      |  |s (wire,  |          |          |          |          |          |          |  |cordless, |          |          |          |          |          |          |  |cellular) |          |          |          |          |          |          |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Facsimiles|341       |407       |19.1      |170       |215       |26.5      |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Measuring |117       |134       |14.7      |85        |100       |17.6      |  |instrumen-|          |          |          |          |          |          |  |ts        |          |          |          |          |          |          |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Telephone |518       |537       |3.6       |83        |105       |27.7      |  |exchanges |          |          |          |          |          |          |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
